It is imperative to build up a contingent of ideological and political workers at the grassroots level who maintain a close tie with the masses , care for the well-being of the masses , and are good at doing the mass work .  
To successfully reinforce the ideological and political work , the key is to practice what one preaches .  Communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .

Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .

The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .

It is an urgent need for meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and forging closer ties between the party and the government on the one hand and the masses on the other .  It is also necessary for implementing tasks of ideological and political work at the grassroots levels .  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .

For half a century , the CPPCC has played an irreplaceable role in the country 's political , economic and social lives and has accumulated rich and valuable experiences .  
The CPPCC is an organization of the Chinese people 's patriotic united front , with the most extensive representation organizationally and the greatest accommodation politically .  It is an important organization for realizing the political system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , as well as an important form of socialist democratic politics which conforms with the Chinese national conditions and serves the fundamental interests of the people .  
For example , the Ministry of Agriculture , Ministry of Science and Technology , and Ministry of Finance regarded proposals on truly rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as highly valuable , and will study and adopt relevant opinions and suggestions when formulating the Agricultural Technology Development Outline . Democratic political parties and CPPCC members raised numerous proposals on narrowing gaps among schools in providing compulsory education and truly reducing workloads of middle and primary school students .  
As changes are taking place in economic structure and social relationships , the CPPCC should make full use of its favorable conditions , such as its extensive contacts and unimpeded channels of information , to go deep into the realities of life and go among the masses to find out the actual conditions and exchange ideas with the masses in order to promptly and accurately report on social conditions and popular sentiments .  It should actively assist the party and the government in coordinating relationships , defusing contradictions , promoting unity , and maintaining social and political stability .

Such achievements we made are a vivid reflection of our adherence to the principle that " development is the last word . "  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
Meanwhile , they are also conducive to enhancing understanding , expanding common understanding , turning the party and government policies and principles into the majority of people 's conscious action , discovering and pooling the wisdom and experience of the masses , relying on the people to tide over difficulties and resolve problems , harmonizing the relationship in distribution of interests , eliminating social contradictions , and safeguarding and developing the political situation featured by unity and stability .  
What is worthy of attention is that because the proposition on " Taiwan independence " has never been accepted by the majority of the Taiwan people , those who have adhered to " Taiwan independence , " have , out of current political needs , asserted that " Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country , " and Taiwan has never been recognized as a part of China 's territory .  
The aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
Guangdong , which is in the forefront of reform and opening up , must all the more enhance understanding of the importance of " grasping things with two hands , with both hands firm , " tangibly strengthen ideological and political work , and launch an extensive and thorough education drive to " think of the source when getting rich , and advance in thinking when getting rich . "  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
It is necessary to establish and perfect a system , under the unified leadership of the party committees , in which the party and government departments and the mass bodies share the work and coordinate with each other and the leading cadres at all levels take on dual responsibilities in their posts ; it is necessary to establish a work mechanism for integrating ideological and political work with work in all aspects , and to form a good " integration " of mutual stimulation between them .  
CPPCC member Kong Lingren [ 1313-0109-0088 ] said : A perfect legal system has yet to be enforced by judicial officials who are steadfast in their political awareness , strict in discipline , honest and just , well-versed in professional knowledge and outstanding in their style of work .  Efforts must be made to strengthen the education and rectification of the judicial force .  
Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
Committee members focused on central tasks to serve the overall situation , and , from a perspective of pushing forward reform and opening , economic development , and safeguarding stability , earnestly performed their functions in conducting political consultation , exercising democratic supervision , and participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs , and offered many valuable suggestions and proposals , whose quality was better than last year .

Article Nine of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall organize and mobilize their members to study Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory ( of building socialism with Chinese characteristics ) ; study current political affairs ; learn and exchange professional , scientific , and technological knowledge ; and enhance their abilities of serving the motherland .  
With a high sense of political responsibility , CPPCC members discussed major agenda , put forward many constructive views and suggestions on the administration of the country according to law , reliance on science and technology to invigorate the nation , sustainable development , great development of China 's western regions , reform of the state-owned enterprise , tackling of poverty , social security , democratic supervision , dealing with corruption , and maintaining social stability .

The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
Handed down through thousands of years , this strong national cohesion has neither weakened with the passage of time nor been shaken by the changes of dynasty and instead has become a lofty standard of value and passionate political belief that has taken root in the depth of the heart of every Chinese .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the egalitarian system of eating from the same big pot in rural areas has been broken , households have become the main entities for economic operation and investment , and peasants have continuously increased their initiative in participating in the social , political , and economic lives .  
Deputy Wang Zhihao is deputy regimental commander of an air force aviation unit with glorious traditions .  This 34 year-old lieutenant colonel , who has been flying for 15 years , stressed : " As a result of training through science and technology in recent years , the overall quality of the air force has been greatly enhanced , while ideological and political education over a long period has rooted in our minds the idea that ' the interests of the motherland and the people are forever supreme . '  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Hegemonism is also manifest in the fact that the US annual Country Report on Human Rights Practices ignores the objective fact that human rights in China are improving all the time , and shows serious political bias in yet again attacking China at great length .  
Zhu Rongji said : Mr President is the Chinese people 's old friend .  We satisfactorily see that in the last 36 years since China and the Republic of Congo forged diplomatic ties , our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have been steadily and smoothly developing .  Sound cooperation full of positive results has been carried out in the political , economic and trade , public health , and educational fields .  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
First , it led the people to establish new China , thus putting an end to the history of being very much enslaved and plundered by foreign countries and savaged by one war after another and the masses living on the edge of starvation in old China and providing fundamental political premises , stable social environments , and excellent social conditions for the development of social productive forces in China .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
In some places and schools in our city of Beijing , there still exist the tendency to emphasize cultural knowledge study and to slight ideological and political education as well as the stubborn disease , of varying degrees of seriousness , of one-sidedly pursuing admissions rates and examination results and slackening ideological and political education as well as social practice activities .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
In international relations , China is opposed to the big bullying the small , the strong bullying the weak , and advocates building a new international political and economic order which is peaceful and steady as well as just and reasonable .  
According to Fu , China hopes that all the countries and nations in the world will undertake friendly cooperation , seek common development , establish a new , just , and rational international political and economic order , and realize lasting peace and common prosperity , and that the peoples of all countries can create and enjoy a happy life in accordance with their wishes .  
On solving the relationships between the central and local authorities , and between the Kremlin and various party factions , Putin has actively consulted with all leaders , striven to reach consensus , and successively promulgated relevant policies , so that Russia 's political situation would not sink into a chaotic situation before the election .

and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The basic purpose of this " three stresses " positive education among all army 's Party organizations is through centralized and general education to practically strengthen grass-roots Party organizations ' cohesive force and combat capability , enhance Party members ' political steadfastness and ethical purity , bring into full play the grass-roots Party organizations ' role of fighting force and the exemplary vanguard role of the Party members , and further consolidate foundations of the Party 's absolute leadership over the army .  
Over the past several years , the CPC Central Committee centered on Comrade Jiang Zemin has been able to grasp the overall situation , engaged in scientific decision-making , and led the entire party and people of all nationalities nationwide in making efforts , resulting in the overcoming of political , economic , and natural difficulties and risks .  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
The " Honest Government Standards " formulated and implemented by the Party during the past few years have not only regulated political behavior for leading Party and government cadres under the socialist market economy , they also have advanced construction and development of the market economic system .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .

We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
If the grass-roots party organizations fail to conduct effective ideological and political work , people may become listless , their minds may be confused , and the organizations may become loose and lax in management .  In such circumstances , profit-making enterprises and advanced units may inevitably collapse .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .

This article criticizes that the US advantages in the economic , political , military , and cultural fields are rapidly growing into a burden .

All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
She is not an isolated individual .  She is the candidate chosen by the DPP and a political figure who is about to step up to the front stage in Taiwan . Hence , the remarks on splitting the motherland which she has spread through the media , are yet another political incident , following Lee Teng-hui 's two-state theory , that has seriously provoked China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Thus , they are more liable to the impact of erroneous ideas and bad phenomena .  In addition , reserve officers and men are scattered over many areas and are engaged in the work of various professions and trades .  Hence , the changes in their political attitude and ideological state are hard to be controlled .  
This is the marked difference between reserve forces and active military units .  To counter this , first political commissars of reserve forces must , when doing ideological and political work , embrace an advanced consciousness and must be fast in making judgement , in transmitting instructions , in giving feedback signals , and in tracking the results .  This is the only way to succeed .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , considerable progress has been made in bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , and other fields .  
Under the situation featured by the accelerated political multipolarization , economic globalization , and the dynamic advances in science and technology humanity is faced with not only rare opportunities for development but also grave challenges .  
Regional conflicts and local wars have broken out one after another .  There is not yet a fundamental change in the unfair and inequitable old international political and economic order .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
Hu Changqing lived a life of utter decadence and corruption and was not afraid to reveal his insatiable avaricious nature .  From that standpoint , to say that Hu Changqing hanged out with the rich and used his power to seek private gain was to put it politely .  In fact he was a complete political hooligan . "  
In contemporary history , the Palestinian people conducted hard and bitter struggles to defend their homeland and national dignity , restore their legitimate national rights and interests , and gain national liberation and independence , composing magnificent paeans .  Finally , they built autonomous political power on their own land .  And they are advancing toward a lofty goal of establishing an independent state .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
He said : Following the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , the United States and some other Western countries have proceeded from the political need of promoting the Western social system and hegemonism , and therefore are extremely reluctant to see China adhering to the socialist path and extremely reluctant to see China adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , continuing to develop and becoming big and powerful .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
One political expert pointed out : During the years since Secretary of State Albright assumed her post , she has not at all had her own set of foreign policies or strategies to deal with the post-Cold War international situation .  She is merely an attendant who carries out US foreign policies .  In addition , on foreign affairs , she often focuses only on her native area of Europe , and adopts an attitude of much disdain toward Eastern and Southern Europe .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
The Chinese government practices a policy of respecting and protecting freedom of religious belief , pursuing the principle of keeping religion , political power and education separate .  The country protects normal religious activities , as well as the legal rights and interests of religious organizations .  The different religions have equal standing and live together harmoniously , and there is mutual respect and unified harmony between the citizens who practice religion and those who do not believe in any religion .  
Jiang Zemin said : The Chinese government implements the policy of respecting and protecting the freedom of religious beliefs , and follows the principle of separating religion from political power and education .  The country protects normal religious activities and the legitimate rights of religious groups .  Different religions in China share equal status , and co-exist in perfect harmony ; and religious believers and non-believers respect each other , and live together in unity and harmony .  
The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing long-term , stable friendly relations and cooperation with Greece and is ready to work together with the Greek side in further expanding and deepening cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields to constantly score new , great successes .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational , and new international political and economic order .  
China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational and new international political and economic order .  
and we should learn from them in taking a firm stance and clearly distinguishing between right and wrong , cherish the excellent situation of stability and unity , and resolutely wage struggle against phenomena that jeopardize ethnic solidarity , national security , and social stability , as practical deeds for preserving social and political stability .  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
The department has carried out rectification and reform at a deeper level , strengthened investigation and study , closely integrated " looking back " with " looking forward , " thought of , discussed and grasped big things , paid greater attention to future work , and further enhanced its political sensitiveness and ability to distinguish political matters .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
It can create " future " wars based on the general law of development governing hi-tech wars and by taking into full consideration China 's security posture , international influence , political and geographical environment , national characteristics , and other distinct features .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
In the process of ideological and political construction , we must take improving ideological and political qualities as the first task in cultivating high-quality talented military people ; meanwhile , we should insure students are competent in such aspects as science and culture , professional military skills , physical abilities and psychological qualities .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
It is necessary to maintain sharp vigilance against and prevent the infiltration and influence of reactionary political views spread by Western hostile forces , such as : the army should " not belong to a party " and should be " nonpoliticized . "  We should effectively strengthen education in the basic character and glorious tradition of our army , make the concept of " the party commanding the gun " take deep root , and ensure that the guns are always in the hands of those who are faithful to Marxism .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Through ideological and political work , we will enhance people 's ideological consciousness , promote good public conduct in society , solve various problems in people 's minds , facilitate communication and mutual understanding among the people , and thus coordinate interpersonal relations , mitigate various social contradictions , and maintain a stable and orderly condition in society while keeping all the vigor and dynamism .  
However , under the current material conditions , ideological and political work can solve problems in people 's minds to different degrees , can better give play to the initiative role of people 's mentality , and make up for the temporary shortage of the material forces with people 's mental forces .  This will prompt the people to create more material wealth .  
The party and government have attached great importance to the harm of piracy in society , and General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji have given important directives on " eliminating pornography " and " cracking down on illegal publications . "  Therefore , we must fully understand the importance of striking at copyright piracy from the high plain of national political , economic , and cultural aspects .  
He meticulously studied Deng Xiaoping Theory and learned a broad range of knowledge related with modern science and technology and ideological and political work .  He came up with a series of methods on how to lead soldiers in the new era , solved a series of problems that officials and soldiers face along their road of life , and promoted the progressive transformation of over a-hundred officials and soldiers .  
In his daily life , he was consistently clean in fulfilling his official responsibilities , without contamination at all .  He is considered an excellent political cadre who was the most convincing and the most authoritative in the eyes of the masses .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
On the world political arena , China , as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and the largest developing country , has a weighty international status and a positive , major impact on peace and development for mankind , which have won high international dignity and honor for itself .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
In the United States , debates revolving round the NMD program are turning hotter , and voices of opposition to it getting louder , in the military and academic circles .  In their public comments , many " celebrities " and knowledgeable personages in society have noted that technically this program has its inherent flaws and poses national security and political dangers .  
Because , as internal disputes are getting white hot and technical and political defects of the NMD program are being exposed daily , the US . Government 's confidence in this program is dropping lower and lower .  
This will be the first summit meeting held between the north and the south since the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 .  As a major breakthrough in north-south political relations , the summit meeting is expected to draw global attention .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
The Central Committee gives its full support to the Party 's basic line , continuing to uphold economic construction as the center , working hard to rectify the phenomenon of ' one hand rather hard , one hand rather soft ' , and strengthening ideological and political work and the building of the Party " .  
" Eliminating pornography and fighting illegal publications " is a matter of social stability , of the physical and mental health of our young , of economic order , and of our international image .  The struggle needs to be looked at from a political point of view , and it needs a great deal of emphasis .  
This is an important measure that the General Department of Politics took to carry out and implement Chairman Jiang 's important directive on improving the purposefulness , efficiency and creativeness of the military 's ideological and political work , and it is a lively and vivid textbook for the military to deeply promote the ideological and ethic education .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
All troops should associate singing these songs with ideological and political education , enthusiastically respond to Chairman Jiang 's call that " the military 's civilization construction should proceed at the forefront of the whole society " , make effort to become exemplary figures who put into practice , and enthusiastically spread this advanced ideology and culture .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
Upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army is always a main subject of our army 's ideological and political education .  After they join the army , the most important education service members receive is " military spirit " .  In the final analysis , when troop units hold lectures , publish blackboard newspapers , show motion pictures , stress traditions , and organize visits to sacred places of revolution , all such activities are closely linked to " the gun obeying the party " .  
Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .  Some generals personally give political lectures .  
He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .  
The Party 's grassroots organizations should profoundly solve the conspicuous problems arising in strengthening the leadership over ideological and political construction , in adhering to the principle of democratic centralism , in strengthening their sense of principles and their combat strength , in conforming to the system of regular activities at grassroots organizations , and in purifying the trend at the grassroots units .  
Through education on " the importance of studying , being political minded and being honest and upright " and education on party style and discipline , we should help the broad masses of party members and cadres foster a correct world outlook and concept of life and value and firmly resist material gains and commercialization in their political life .  We should help them clarify their thinking and distinguish between right and wrong and constantly strengthen their ability to repel corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
and for regular schools of higher learning to recruit regular senior high school graduates who are excellent both in character and learning in line with the directional enrollment plans of relevant state and military departments , make sure that they receive necessary military and political training while completing their college courses , and assign them to work in the military according to what they are trained for .  
Units at the military region level will establish offices composed of various functional departments to take charge of the training of reserve military officers .  Major duties of the offices are to organize and guide their subordinate units to select and train students of regular schools of higher learning , provide military and political training , and examine and recruit these students .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
( VI ) The party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program , and the brilliant achievements of reform , opening-up , and socialist modernization have enriched the connotation of patriotism , and raised the patriotic feelings of our nation , and aroused the entire people 's patriotic enthusiasm .  Over more than 20 years , our nation enjoyed political stability , economic growth , national unity ;  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
In the second half of 1995 , units at the grassroots level of the South China Sea Fleet stationed in the opening area of the special economic zone reflected that the original experience and methods of ideological and political work seemed to be unworkable now .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
The second signal company of a garrison district of a navy unit stationed in Shantou has often carried out " letting everyone talk " activities in promoting ideological work and encouraged fighters to mount on the stage of self-education .  Everyone can offer his opinions on specific topics and on methods to solve problems and make contributions .  In this way , the unit has promoted the " appropriate , systematic and creative nature " of ideological and political work through mass work .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
In local war , one strictly selects military and non-military targets and employs the most accurate and " humane " attack .  This tactic itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
They do not manage nor bother to know those issues affecting the personal interests and feelings of the masses and do not conduct patient and meticulous ideological and political work for giving timely guidance .  Some grass-roots party organizations are in a weak and slack state and do not display the roles they should in the ideological and political work .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
To study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we must get an ever clearer understanding of the requirements of the new situation for ideological and political work , enhance our sense of suffering , not lose sight of the importance of ideological and political work , foster the sense of urgency in doing a good job of the work , see of the protracted nature , complexity , and arduousness of the work , and make adequate mental preparations to carry out the work in the long term .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
In particular , during the magnificent 20th century , the people of Asia were indomitable in going all out to make their countries strong , composing a magnificent historical epic of their political awakening and economic upsurge and giving a powerful impetus to historical progress and social development .  
These principles have now become universal standards for country-to-country relations , playing a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the friendship and cooperation among developing countries in general , and they are and will continue to have an important impact on the promotion of the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
The new international political and economic order should be based on commonly-recognized standards of international relations , be suited to the development and progress needs of the age , and reflect the spirit of peace and equality , with all countries being equal regardless of their relative size , wealth , or strength .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
Okinawa is a Japanese prefecture in southern Kyushu and comprises Okinawa , Miyako , Yaeyama and other islands .  The main Okinawa Island is 1,185 sq km at the center of the Ryukyu archipelago .  Northern hilly areas account for two-thirds of the entire island .  Naha , the capital at the south of Okinawa Island , is Okinawa Prefecture 's political and cultural center .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
The Asian financial crisis has given us a practical lesson .  Financial security is no longer a pure economic issue .  It has a bearing on the political and social security of a country and is part and parcel of national security .  
A limited war is to strictly select military and non-military targets and employ the most accurate and " humane " attack .  The tactics itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
In diligently studying and understanding this important exposition , we have the profound feeling that only by firmly grasping the key points of strengthening and improving ideological and political work and working hard to enhance " one feeling three qualities " can ideological and political work provide formidable impetus and guarantees for reform and opening up and modernization construction in an atmosphere of continuing innovation and expanding advances .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
During the three major political struggles last year in particular , the educational leadership role of the news media was given full play , and waves of resistance to foreign aggression , protection of sovereignty , opposition of splittism , and strengthening of China were set off .  A healthy atmosphere in the whole society opposing superstition and resisting heretical teachings formed .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
Originally he planned on staying a night in the United States and expanding his impetus and influence and gaining political capital by publicly meeting US pro-Taiwan congressmen and local overseas Chinese ; the United States , however , was worried that it would get into a deadlock with China , and stressed that during his stopover the new leader " can not have any public agenda " .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
We must ensure first that they are qualified in the political sense , and second in a scientific and cultural sense , in professional skills and capacities and also in physical and psychological health .  We must further ensure that these experts have acquired comprehensive knowledge in various fields , overall coordination abilities , an innovative spirit as well as innovative capacities .  
To cope with the various challenges facing mankind 's survival and development , people strongly hope for the establishment of a new , fair and rational international political and economic order and the creation of an international peaceful environment that is safe and reliable and enjoys long-term stability and of an international harmonious situation in which countries make their own choices independently and seek common ground while reserving differences .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
We must clearly perceive the political conspiracy and sinister ambition of western hostile forces on the human rights issue , always remain politically sober and staunch , and shoulder our mission of protecting the nation 's security and unity .  
By grasping overall and key problems related to the comprehensive building of the grassroots party organizations , we can truly resolve problems in the grassroots party organizations that are of the nature of trends , ensure the effects and quality of " three stresses " education , and successfully achieve marked ideological improvement , marked political progress , marked transformation of work style , marked strengthening of discipline , marked progress in work , marked changes in quality , marked strengthening of the fortress role , and marked improvement in relations between officers and men .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The civilization and progress of the society , the vivid and lively political environment , and especially the socialist democratic and political life created and developed by the people under the leadership of the party have made people 's minds greatly tempered and increasingly mature .  
Along with the development of the social , political , economic , and cultural life , the independent and optional space for people 's ideological activities will become more extensive .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his noble character of selflessness , with which he has become a model of virtue for others , realized the true value of his life through making selfless dedications , and has retained the true political color of a communist party member .  
In the broad sense , saving oneself means to save your side 's material and mental strength , specifically including your side 's land , people , and actual political , military , and economic strength , as well as the nation 's or people 's will to resist , etc . , i.e . , what is commonly known as overall national strength .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
Generally speaking , cadres of our province are good .  Firm in political confidence , working hard , and with an incorruptible and realistic work style , they have made positive contributions to Sichuan 's reform and opening-up , economic construction , and social progress .  
In addition , we should firmly uphold the concept that " our cause is of utmost importance " and adhere to the principle of training cadres who have both ability and political integrity and the principle of making our cadre contingent more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more competent professionally .  The party 's line and policy concerning cadres should be fully and properly carried out , and the established standard should be strictly complied with in selecting and promoting young cadres .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
Since the historic meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and ROK , Kim Chong-il and Kim Tae-chung , held in mid-June in which the " North-South Joint Declaration " was signed , both sides have developed a series of exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , cultural , and other fields , with gratifying progress made .  
It is a pressing and important task with high requirements to conduct admonitory education with the serious cases of Cheng Kejie and Hu Changqing . Party committees at all levels must take admonitory education as a major political task , and fulfill this task by doing intensive and effective work with a strong sense of political responsibility , sufficient energy for exercising leadership , and a soaring morale and healthy mentality , thus guaranteeing that admonitory education achieve expected solid results .  
Ever since the beginning of reform and opening up , in particular , earthshaking changes have taken place in Sichuan . The province has deepened its reform , rapidly opened itself wider to the outside world , attained high-speed economic growth , brought about comprehensive progress to all its social undertakings , and has provided a comfortable living and working environment for its people .  The entire province is now enjoying a sound national unity , a stable political situation , and prevailing social stability .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
The people 's democratic dictatorship as a form of state and the people 's congress system as a form of government of what our country has been pursuing are the result of the people 's struggle and a historical choice made by the people .  They are the corner stone of our country 's political system which not only suits our country 's national conditions but also reflects the substantive requirements of socialism .  
At present and in a longer period to come , the old capitalist system will continue to surround the new socialist system .  The socialist system , which is young and pretty much immature , can only struggle to survive and seek development under the pressure of capitalist countries which are dominating over and enjoying a favorable position of strength within the framework of the old international political and economic order .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
how are we going to reform the old international political and economic order that is dominated by a small number of developed western countries and to build a new international political and economic order which is fair and reasonable ;  
Right after the layout revamping , they , having carried out meticulous planning , organized personnel from the internet center of the Navy 's political department to turn out the " New Revelation of Chinese Navy " and " Roaring Waves " , which are major features of a completely new style , and organized this newspaper 's editorial force to produce a feature of a strong journalistic character - - " ' Towering Giant ' of Chinese Men 's Basketball - - 1 August Team " .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
Therefore , it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the work of controlling the political and ideological conditions of the cadres .  In particular , it is necessary to set up concrete procedures and work out concrete standards and methods for assessing the political and ideological quality of a cadre .  The conclusion of the assessment should also be more specific and detailed .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .  He sought no privilege for himself and always maintained the distinctive political character of plain living and hard struggle .  
This afternoon , ministers from some 40 African countries in charge of diplomacy and economic and trade affairs gathered together with their Chinese counterparts in the Grand Banquet Hall of Beijing Hotel for the China-Africa Cooperation Forum - - Ministerial Conference 2000 .  They held a candid exchange of opinions and discussions on the two major themes of this conference : promoting the building of a new international political and economic order through China-Africa cooperation and further developing China-Africa economic and trade cooperation .  
This is not only an inevitable choice that developing countries must make in order to seek development in the new century , but also a driving force for building at an early date a new international political and economic order that is just and reasonable .  
This humorous remark elicited warm applause of all participants in the forum , which expressed the strong aspiration of developing countries toward building a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
Beijing University 's Xia Xueluan , a professor in the Sociology Department , pointed out that a few people supposedly originally practiced " Falungong " to keep fit and healthy , but they are now under the control and manipulation of ringleaders from foreign reactionary organizations , and they are embracing covert political aims to deliberately destroy the excellent condition of the country 's stability and unity .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
The flames of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea disappeared nearly 50 years ago .  Unprecedented changes have taken place in the international political structure and the world military arena .  However , the valuable experience gained from this war cuts through space-time , exceeds national boundaries , and becomes an extensive and precious historical textbook .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
Liu : First of all , we must ascertain that development is the main theme .  We are faced with the political pressure of international hegemonism , the pressure from the developed countries with their superiority in high technology , and our arduous tasks in China 's modernization drive .  Only by greatly raising our productive forces , can we build a material foundation to solve all kinds of social problems .  
A : We should also see that our country is faced with severe challenges amid international political and economic struggles and the fierce competition for comprehensive national strength .  
In order to establish a rational and just new international and economic order , our country must further reform in greater depth and win world respect and a favorable international political and economic environment with powerful economic strength and comprehensive national strength .  
In accordance with the requirements laid down in its five-year program , the division 's party committee has divided fighting capacity building into four major aspects , namely , political work , military work , logistical support , and equipment and technical support ; has tackled bottlenecks which prevent new-type equipment from turning into all-round fighting capacity by focusing on key and thorny issues ; and has laid a solid foundation step by step .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
This important directive was made from a long-term and broad perspective , through both dialectical materialism and historical materialism , and with an eye on the requirements for the development of the times .  This directive has set the direction for strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new period .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
This shows that the Government had held sufficient consultations with the Legislative Council and people were satisfied with the Legislative Council 's work efficiency and all these have laid a sound foundation for Macao 's social and political stability and economic development . 
and have improved social order to a significant extent , and this has created a favorable atmosphere for enlivening Macao 's tourism industry and has laid a necessary foundation or provided favorable conditions for creating an environment for Macao 's harmonious and stable political and social life .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
With history as a guide and the future as his orientation , he worked hard to reach a consensus with both the Japanese government and Japanese outside the government on deepening the partnership of friendship and cooperation between the two countries .  As a result , mutual understanding was deepened , the political foundation of bilateral relations was reinforced , and the development of friendly cooperation in all fields was given a boost .  At the same time , there remain in Japan the soil and climate for the growth of militarism .  
and the leaders of regional organizations .  President Jiang Zemin put forward a four-point proposal at the meeting designed to strengthen Sino-African cooperation and promote the creation of a new international economic and political order .  His proposal won universal praise from those in attendance .  
He discussed China 's principled stand on creating a new international political and economic order .  Like water pouring down a steep roof , his words powerfully reflected the heartfelt wishes of the peoples of all nations , particularly the numerous developing nations , for peace and development and were widely praised by the delegations .  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
The world is still not free from disturbance .  In face of the complicated situation in which international relations are undergoing profound adjustments , opportunities and challenges coexist , political parties of all countries , including the ruling , participating , and opposition parties , are keeping eyes on the 21st century in a bid to explore a development strategy that better fits the trend of the times and their respective reality .  
In the course of advancing their work in the key fields , trade unions at all levels actively assisted the party organizations and the local governments in doing effective ideological and political work among the working masses , carried out " economic and technical innovation projects " among the working masses , organized and guided workers to enhance their work skills , learn from the advanced , do a first-class job , and make greater contributions .  All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
Nonetheless , under the conditions of the socialist market economy and along with the gradual deepening of our country 's political or economic structural reform as well as the in-depth development of our army building , our present enlistment system governing officers in active service has turned incompatible with the needs of a new situation or a new task in certain aspects , and it is thereby imperative to replenish or amend the " Regulations " in an appropriate way .  
To impose one 's own favored undiversified model on others can only artificially destroy social and political ecological equilibrium , a course of action which is neither rational not feasible .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
Our undertaking of reform , opening up and socialist modernization has been pushed forward into a new stage .  In China today , it is a scene of political stability , economic development , national unity , social progress , constantly improving living standard , and prosperity .  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
It has been only 80 years since the time the first socialist state was founded , so most socialist states have a history of 40 or 50 years , which places them at the initial development stage .  Their economic , political , and social working mechanisms have not been completely developed and established , they still strive hard exploring how to fully develop the advantages of socialism .  
Practice has proven that since the actual foundations on which individual countries establish socialism vary , their methods of gaining political power vary , and their ethnic and national conditions vary , there can be no single model of development that fits every country .  
Just as a weak president is bound to face strong opposition in Congress , the White House and the Congress are bound to find friction or contradiction between them on a regular basis , and this will become a salient characteristic of the US political arena in the future .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
Ways , means , and methods which are receiving widespread application are continuing and improving classroom education , " second classrooms , " on-line political work , cultural improvement , psychological guidance , standardizing laws and discipline , self-education , benefits driving , improving the level of education in science , and leaders taking the lead and setting the example .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
The two sides unanimously held that the five principles of peaceful coexistence , which were advocated by the two countries 47 years ago and have subsequently been widely recognized and practiced by the international community since then , are still shining in resplendent fashion and maintaining powerful vitality today , and represent the cornerstone in building a new international political and economic order .  
One of the important issues in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to correctly deal with the influence of the international environment and the international political struggle on people 's thoughts in the course of persistently carrying out reforms , opening up , and increasing economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world , while actively absorbing and learning from all the good results achieved by human society as a whole in civilization development , and effectively resist the corrosive influence of the decadent ideologies and cultures from the West .  
However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella . "  They have tried by hook or by crook to infiltrate into party and government organizations to seek political protection even to the point of directly seizing political power .  This is an extremely dangerous signal .  It is terribly harmful .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
Li Hongzhi 's repeated spread such fallacies as " making perfect accomplishment of rising to the Heavens , " " disregarding life and death , " " moving toward perfect accomplishments , " and all of this was sheer nonsense and heresy aimed at deceiving and instigating those obsessed and being controlled to act desperately as his " cannon folder " or sacrifices for his sinister political schemes . 
After the inside story of a cult has been exposed and its crimes brought to the light of day , the cult master never hesitates to regard the lives of his followers as sacrifices and political gambling stakes and lures them into committing mass suicide or causing terrorist incidents such as kidnapping , assassination , releasing poison , or causing explosions , in order to shock the world by antisocial and antihuman actions . 
It has been disclosed that the Clinton Administration doubted if the Iraqi opposition organization was able to overthrow the Saddam regime .  But , just before he left office , he approved the establishment of a political fund as much as $ 12-million for the purpose of aiding Baghdad 's opposition forces .  The fund will mainly be used to establish radio stations , carry out various kinds of subversive activities , and investigate war crimes committed by senior Iraqi officials .  
The pro-Taiwan forces in the United States , who have called themselves " the blue unit , " have also advanced quite a few political propositions marked by strong ideological colors , and this has undermined the US-China relations ' healthy development and has frequently contravened the US strategic interests as well .  
Since hostile forces and saboteurs at home and abroad seize every opportunity and try by hook or by crook to steal China 's political , military , economic , cultural , and educational intelligence , cases of leakage of secrets are frequent and startling , posing a serious threat to the information security of the party , the state , and the military .  
Therefore , it is essential that we further expose and criticize the false reasoning and heretical teachings of " Falungong " in order to further uncover the political nature of " Falungong " and the severe harm it causes , and to drive out evil and usher in the good so as to ensure total victory in this battle .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
We must closely unite around the Central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the mighty banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , further raising awareness , following up each victory with fervent pursuit , and resolutely removing and discarding the " social tumor " of " Falungong " , in order to consolidate and develop the stable and united political situation of our nation as well as to ensure the successful progress of liberalized reforms and the undertakings of modernized construction .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
They should train and bring up a contingent of high-quality leaders of different types at various levels who are firm in their political stand , manifest new pioneering spirit and possess modern scientific , educational and managerial knowledge as well as a contingent of specialty technicians and economic managerial personnel urgently needed in our region .  
In the political sphere described by Putin as the " crux of Russia 's rejuvenation , " Russia has , by means of the Federal Constitution , straightened out the relations between the central authorities and various republics , oblasts , and border regions ; curbed the separatist tendency of local regimes ; and severely cracked down on the separatist attempt by illegal armed groups in Chechenya , initially restoring a powerful state power system .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .  
The reporter has learned that these units that were evaluated as tops in training have several clear features : Their major military and political officers are all outstanding commanders , having top overall comprehensive quality , and very strong command and control training ability .  
The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
The starting point of this assumption ( namely , guarding against the threat of missile attacks ) of the United States failed to convince Germany . A considerably large number of personages from the military and political circles believed that this is not reasonable .  Because during the Cold War period , the threat of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union to West Europe was many , many times bigger than it is now , did not the East-West balanced posture based on nuclear deterrent ensure the security of Germany ?  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
Persisting in focusing on economic construction and greatly liberating and developing the social productive forces are the largest political missions for China at the present time and reflect the basic interests of the people across the country , including the vast majority of members of the united front .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
We hope various levels of party committees and governments across the autonomous region will earnestly put into effect the party 's policies toward agricultural and pastoral areas and unite and lead the broad masses of cadres to develop production , improve living standards , " bring social order out of chaos , " and " tackle problems caused by stupidity , " so that our region will advance by leaps and bounds and achieve prolonged political stability .  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
The good situation has been pioneered by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  The ideological and political foundation , the material and technical foundation , and the mass foundation , that we have already possessed to realize the three major historical tasks in the new situation , have been laid by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
Ideological and political building has been further enhanced , preparations for military struggle have been thorough and sound , notable success has been achieved in national defense scientific research and armament modernization , all-round backup capability has been markedly strengthened , and there has been a very big improvement in the army 's all-round combat capability in hi-tech conditions .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .  In the face of the complex situation at home and abroad , our army held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and resolutely obeyed the commands of the CPC Central Committee and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; ideological and political building was further stepped up ;  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
The Consulate General of the People 's Republic of China Consulate in Chicago and the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , the largest independent , non-profit international affairs organization in the Midwest , recently held a joint reception at the Chinese consulate , which was attended by nearly one-hundred persons including members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , as well as persons from political , commercial , academic and media circles . 
We should help our cadres raise their political ability in appraising things , maintain a sober mind in the face of a complicated situation , and be bold and courageous while be prudent like standing on the edge of a cliff or ice .  
Deputies pledged to carry forward the spirit of incessant struggle advocated by President Jiang , have a high sense of political and historical responsibility , strengthen army building in an all-round way , and score good results in the two historical subjects of " winning the battle " and " never changing color " .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
The fact that under the staunch leadership of the party , the anti-separatist struggle in our region has turned from the state of passively meeting an emergency to one of taking the initiative to tackle problems in a comprehensive way and that our social and political situation remains stable shows that the 2.6-million people of all ethnic groups , the main body in the struggle against the separatist clique headed by the Dalai , are carrying out this struggle with strong determination , redoubled confidence , and high morale until they win a complete victory .  
At present , with the kind attention of the central authorities and the vigorous support of the people of the whole country , the people of all ethnic groups in our region are firmly seizing the rare opportunity provided by the stable political situation and the large-scale development of west China and , with unprecedented enthusiasm and drive , striking up a magnificent movement of leapfrogging development .  
The vast majority of these comrades are young in age , good in political quality , highly educated , possessing of strong professional ability , broadminded , ideologically emancipated , highly conscious of reform , and down-to-earth in style of work .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .  
In light of the numerous conjectures about China 's timetable on joining the WTO , Zhang said : China is ready to make joint efforts with the WTO members to finish the talks at an early date , but it is hard for the Chinese side to predict a specific timeframe for its accession because this does not depend on China alone but on the 140 WTO members , especially on the political desire of some developed countries . 
In a country which originally does not have a strong religious awareness , while reaffirming man 's right to freedom of faith , we must also let our kindhearted people know how high a cost the Western world has paid in blood and how protracted and arduous a struggle it has gone through in its pursuit of a peaceful coexistence between religion and rationality and in its effort to gradually bury the various extremist religions and political propositions .  
As China is a developing country as well as a major country which brooks no neglect in the political and economic life in the world .  Because China conducts a lot of international trade , when the trade talks involve concrete conflicting interests among the parties , everybody wants to hold the negotiations in a more explicit and detailed manner .  
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
Yang stressed that China 's accession to the WTO will have a profound impact on China 's economic and even political and social life and that the existing administrative and management concepts , systems , structures , methods , and means need to be transformed in an in-depth manner .  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
Article 37 All units shall do a good job in selecting , assigning , training , or appointing military scientific research personnel ; introduce or refine an incentive mechanism ; give full scope to enthusiasm or creativity on the part of research personnel ; and work hard to build a high-quality contingent of military scientific research personnel , including both full-time and part-time personnel , who are known for political integrity , professional proficiency , a rigorous style , and a rational structure .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
But it still goes back to the same old question , that is , without the initiative of civil society , without the basis of full-scale economic division and full-scale division of social interests , and without the existence of a lenient and compromising political culture that is organically associated with such division of the socio-economic structure , it will end up with the same predicament of " quasi-multiparty system " in the early ROC years if what we have is merely the aspiration for the superficial efficacy of multiparty system .  
To be more specific , the ideology of an all-embracing government takes the goal conception of equalitarianism as the basis of social integration , whereas in the case of post-omnipotenism with Chinese characteristics , political integration is primarily founded on the authority of the state apparatus and the system , yet the utopian " political myth " embodied in a dogmatic ideology has already been abandoned , and efforts have been made to try to gain the people 's recognition of state power with " practical economic results . "  
To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
Wang Shijie stressed : In the new century , various countries should promote democratization of international relations and establish a new international political and economic order that is fair and just .  They should ensure that the broad masses of developing countries have the right to equally participate in the decisions on global economic affairs .  
Chen Shui-bian 's burning task at the moment is to find out , externally , a highly adaptable political medium who has a diversified attribute and a low and incorruptible political feature , just like the old Siew . In addition , Chen Shui-bian should continue to have Yuan-tseh Lee [ Li Yuan-che ] , a renowned scholar refusing to associate with officials of doubtful reputation , reinforce the consensus within the country .  After this , he will be able to launch an attack in the chess game .  
The building of national defense is an important part of the great cause of the party and the country and various sectors have attached great importance to it .  Politically speaking , it is in a high and glorious position .  Besides , it is guaranteed with powerful ideological and political work and the conditions for political life is favorable .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
Because of all this , it has become a top priority for the Chinese in the post-Deng era to diligent pursue the establishment of effective supervision mechanisms suited for China 's national conditions and to promote democratic system innovation in a situation of relative political stability , so as to prevent China from being trapped in endemic corruption and an " emergency room paradox " resulting from the dilemma created by the contradictions . 
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
He said that under the current international situation of multipolarization and economic globalization , the developing countries should intensify unity and coordination , cope with all problems in a positive attitude , and make concerted efforts to establish a fair , reasonable new international political and economic order .  
At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .  To retort , Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai pointed out in all seriousness that the United States was keen to dish out human rights motions against other countries , wantonly attacked other countries ' political systems by flaunting the banner of " safeguarding human rights , " tried hard to turn human rights issues into political issues for achieving its political purpose of exerting pressure onto other countries .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
Brazilian Ambassador Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto said that Brazil and China are two important developing countries , adding that the two countries have had good ties of political cooperation and take an identical or similar stand on major international affairs .  He said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries would further cement bilateral relations and deepen mutual understanding and consensus between the two peoples .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
To carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things , it is necessary to build a contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
Party committees and governments at all levels must provide the political and legal front with carefully selected cadres , who are ideologically and politically sound , proficient in professional work , bold and resolute , and able to meet the needs of the political and legal front , and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels of the political and legal front .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that by making arrangements for unfolding a nationwide struggle to " strike hard " and put things right , the national public order work conference fully expressed the strong resolve of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to preserve social and political stability and the fundamental interests of the masses , and this will have a major and far-reaching impact on ensuring the smooth progress of China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization and achieving lasting political stability in the country .  
The leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility for comprehensively implementing the party 's basic line and adhering to the four cardinal principles ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on major issues of principle , keep clear heads amid complex struggle , strengthen their political sensitivity and political distinguishing ability , and wage resolute struggle against all phenomena that jeopardize party and state interests .  
Addressing the general debate at the 105th Conference of the Inter Parliamentarian Union on 4 April , Jiang Zhenghua , vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , called on the international community to promote the process of political multipolarity , capitalize on the opportunity of economic globalization to achieve common development and prosperity for all countries , and establish a new , peaceful , stable , fair , and rational political and economic world order in the new century .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
- - All developing countries strengthen unity , make joint efforts toestablish a fair and reasonable international political and economic new order.Strive to advance democratization in international relations ;  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Commenting on the issue of building a new international political and economic order , Jiang Zemin pointed out : The new international political and economic order should be built on the basis of the Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence - - mutual respect for each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other internal affairs , equality and reciprocity , and peaceful coexistence - - and other universally acknowledged norms governing international relations .  
All localities and all departments must keep a strong sense of political responsibility and the spirit of being highly responsible to the interests of the people , carefully organize their actions according to the unified arrangements of the central leadership , take effective measures and achieve solid results in restoring a regular and orderly condition of the market so that the people can be satisfied and can set their minds at rest .  
It was not long before China 's underworld organizations and evil forces rapidly spread and become rampant throughout the country .  They have seriously endangered the people 's life , infringed upon their property , undermined their security and threatened the political , economic , and social stability of the country .  
Jiang Zemin said : " Uruguay is beautiful and fertile .  It has long-term political stability and sustained economic development .  The people 's living standard has continued to rise and the country has played a positive role in international affairs .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
Different countries differ not only in their geographical location but also in their level of economic development and historical and cultural traditions .  Thus , they are bound to have different political , economic and social systems , and it is unrealistic to achieve unification using one and the same model .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
The fact that our party has put forward the need to serve as a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and taken the realization , development , and safeguarding of the people 's fundamental interests as the ultimate aim of all its political activities fully demonstrates the organic integration of the party 's advanced nature with the extensive nature of the masses .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
People of countries the world over , politicians , political parties , social groups , and media of many countries including the United States , and overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have made speeches and published articles supporting the Chinese Government 's just stance and the spirit of struggle in showing no fear of mighty power , attacked the unreasonable and unjustified US attitude , and exposed the US conspiracy to trample on the sovereignty of other countries and establish world hegemony .  
Based on the principle of making active strikes against crimes and of cracking down on crimes whenever they occur , Xinjiang has maintained high pressure on national splittists , violent terrorist groups , and religious extremists and has thwarted their splittist activities several times , thereby realizing political and social stability for Xinjiang .  
Being the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres , China and Brazil have the duties to play a positive role in propelling the healthy development of the world political and economic situations .  
Intensifying coordination and cooperation and deepening the strategic partnership between China and Brazil is of vital significance to augmenting the strength of the developing countries as a whole and giving impetus to the establishment of a fair , rational new political and economic order in the world .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
We must fully understand the importance and urgency of doing a good job of public security work , earnestly implement the " strike hard " principle and various measures for comprehensive management of social security , which were formulated by the central authorities , and create a sound social environment for the state 's long-term political stability and economic development .  
We must build , in accordance with the requirement of " enforcing laws strictly and rendering warmhearted service " that was set by General Secretary Jiang , our contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
Although outsiders were worried that the influence of the Liberation Army would override the diplomatic system in the process of making diplomatic policy decisions or worried that without such authoritative political leaders as Mao and Deng , Jiang Zemin might not be strong enough to have the overall situation in his hand and might not make a final decision on releasing the American crew members , the Chinese Communists still proved with their action that Jiang Zemin was able to bring everything under his control .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
Guided by revolutionary theory , he plunged into the practice of revolutionary struggle with tremendous political fervor and outstanding courage and insight , and engaged in pioneering practice and exploration in party building , theoretical propaganda , united front work , mass work , and armed struggle ; in these he made outstanding contributions and fully displayed the leadership talent of a politician and social activist .  
The Supreme People 's Court today issued a circular , requiring that law courts at all levels throughout the country seriously implement the central arrangements , give full play to the role of their judicial function in trying criminal cases , rapidly devote all strength to the " hard striking " anticrime struggle , resolutely mete out severe punishments to criminal offenders according to the laws , effectively perform their important duties of punishing criminals , maintaining social and political stability , and protecting the life and property safety of the masses .  
At today 's pledging and mobilizing meeting held by the city public security organs in Urumqi City to launch the " hard striking " anti-crime struggle , Du Jianxi said that although ethnic separatists and violent terrorists were suppressed in most cases , they still pose a threat to social and political stability .  
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze held talks with visiting Chinese State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing in Tbilisi on the afternoon of 13 April . Both sides exchanges views , in a thoroughgoing way , on political relations between China and Georgia , the exchange and cooperation in various fields of endeavor , and international local issues of common interest , and reached a broad consensus of understanding .  
A Communist China official confirmed that since 18 March last year , Chang Yung-fa , who is an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian , had been unable to visit the mainland due to political reason .  However , after " understanding " Chang Yung-fa has " once again " reiterated his stance of supporting the three direct links with the mainland , the Communist China 's leader approved Chang 's business trip to the mainland .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .  The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
China assigns importance to the development of friendly ties with Lebanon and is happy to see Lebanon ending its civil war , achieving national conciliation , recovering the occupied territories in Southern Lebanon , and restoring political stability .  He wished that Lebanon would be able to make still greater achievements in economic recovery and reconstruction .  
China attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Yugoslavia in the political , economic , cultural and educational areas .  China maintains that healthy development of Sino-Yugoslav relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries .  
Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is a country with beautiful mountains and rivers and rich natural resources .  The diligent and courageous Venezuelan people are endowed with glorious historical traditions .  At present , under the leadership of President Chavez , the Venezuelan Government and people are making vigorous efforts to push forward political , economic , and social reform ;  
He died a heroic death to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  He loved the party , loved our Army , loved his work as a pilot , worked hard and practiced diligently .  He was an outstanding pilot with high political quality and professional proficiency .  
When selecting candidates , we should consistently adhere to the standards and strictly guarantee the political quality of those to be promoted .  Outstanding female cadres who can fully , correctly , actively implement the party 's basic line , persistently take the role of socialism with Chinese characteristics , can distinguish the right from the wrong on major principle issues , and can withstand tests at critical junctures should be selected and promoted to leading bodies .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
President Jiang Zemin began his visit to the six Latin American countries on 5 April and he visited Chile , Argentina , Uruguay , Brazil , Cuba and Venezuela one after another .  During his visit to the six countries , President Jiang Zemin separately held talks with the heads of state and met with leaders of the parliaments and political parties of these countries , had a deep exchange of views with them on developing bilateral relations and on international issues of common concern , and reached extensive consensus .  
Li Zhaoxing finally said : President Jiang 's visit to Latin America is one of historical significance , for it has forcefully furthered the Sino-Latin American friendly cooperation in an all-round way in the new century ; has expanded China 's influence in the world ; and is of vital significance and far-reaching influence to enhancing unity and cooperation among the broad masses of developing countries and to facilitating the establishment of new , fair , and reasonable political and economic order in the world .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
Under new circumstances , the political struggles and tests facing officers and men are mainly tasks in daily life , and they rarely experience major personal struggles .  Consequently , some comrades may easily become less politically aware , fail to notice disturbances in their peaceful life , and not be politically vigilant against infiltration of hostile forces .  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
This thinking is a succinct summary of the correct world outlook , outlook on life , and concept on value for the communist party members , which has reflected the demands on cadres by the new situation and tasks , and embodied the unity in the criteria for political integrity and professional competence .  
Comrade Wang Enmao , an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China , a tested and loyal fighter for communism , a proletarian revolutionary , a brilliant political leader of the party and the army , and a vice chairman of the Sixth and Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , passed away at 10:45 on 12 April 2001 in Beijing , after his illness failed to respond to any medical treatment .  He was 88 years old .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
and he was a recidivist .  In accordance with the relevant provisions of the criminal law , Shijiazhuang Intermediate People 's Court sentenced Jin Ruchao to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of causing explosions and , separately , sentenced him to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of voluntary manslaughter .  It ruled that the death penalty be executed and his political rights deprived for life .  
Vietnam has witnessed political and social stability , sustained and rapid economic advancement , remarkable changes in all sectors , gradual improvement of people 's life , and continued advancement of its international status .  The country has entered a new historic period of industrialization and modernization .  
we must learn his high degree of political awareness and dauntless heroism of firmly bearing in mind the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people , being courageous and firm , boldly marching forward , and pledging his life to safeguard national sovereignty and national dignity .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
Those who deviate from the party 's basic line and behave in a double-dealing manner , those who fail to stand tests at critical moments of the political struggle or hold an ambiguous attitude in an attempt to dodge the struggle , those who disregard the interests of the party and the people and are only keen on seeking personal fame and power through getting official positions by means of bribery or currying favor with influential people or playing defrauds must not be allowed to enter leading bodies .  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
Li Lanqing said : One of the main purposes of my current visit to France is , while pushing forward political and economic cooperation between China and France , to boost development of cultural exchange and cooperation between the two countries - - this is extremely important and indispensable to promoting the comprehensive partnership between our two countries .  
The Japanese Government has ignored repeated solemn representations of the Chinese Government and calls for justice from within Japan and decided on the evening of 20 April to issue a Japanese visa to Lee Teng-hui , on the excuse of so-called " humanitarian grounds " and " non-involvement in political activities and being limited to medical purposes , " thereby giving the green light for Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan .  
However , it is noteworthy that Taiwan political figures one after another have jumped forward to apply pressure to the Japanese side and asked for a visa for Lee Teng-hui .  This has fully exposed Lee Teng-hui 's complete ulterior motives in eagerly seeking to travel to Japan for " medical treatment . "  In fact , this is a political plot meticulously planned and directed by the " Taiwan independence " forces , with Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian as their representatives .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
The contacts of officials at high level are frequent , the exchange and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , cultural , public health , science and technology , and other spheres are expanding with each passing day , and the mutual support and coordination in the international affairs are unceasingly intensified .  
Having pretty much tried all the economic revival programs to no avail , a succession of undercurrents is appearing in Japan involving the use of " an arms buildup and expanded military industry production to stimulate an economic recovery , " attempting to shift Japan toward a model in which " arms stimulate the economy " and thus achieving the goal of " killing two birds with one stone , " that is , getting the economy to take a temporary turn for the better and also achieving the goal of becoming a great military and political power .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
7 .  Both sides confirm that they hold identical or similar views and stands on major international and regional issues at present and are willing to strengthen the two countries ' close cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations and make joint efforts toward establishing new international political and economic orders that are just and rational .  
After the crew 's safe return , however , senior US military and political officials immediately turned around and went back on their word , reversed right and wrong , produced lame arguments , and even put the blame on others ; they publicly declared that military reconnaisance operations against China are " for the purpose of ensuring our security interests and protecting the security of our allies , " " preserving world peace , " and so on .  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
Supporting the Party 's principles , guiding public opinion in the correct direction , the overall situation of serving Tibet : these are three mutual relationships coexisting in a single entity ; this is a political demand the Party makes of its organs ' newspapers , the sublime mission of those who run the newspapers .  
We must strengthen our building of leadership teams , keep our objectives firmly in mind , strengthen Party spirit , consider the situation as a whole , unite closely , fulfill promises , strive to implement the Party line , have an effective and strong ideological level , political awareness and professional capability , building a strong leadership collective capable of bearing its historical responsibility .  
Disregarding the several solemn representations of the Chinese Government and the strong objections voiced by the Japanese people of all walks of life , the Japanese Government had finally decided , on the evening of 20 April , to issue a visa to Lee Teng-hui for his visit to Japan . This visa was granted under the pretext of so-called " humanitarianism " and under the condition that the visit is limited to only medical treatment , without engaging in any political activity . 
It is reported that running in-depth education study classes are mainly aimed at meeting the needs of giving additional knowledge to former " Falungong " practitioners who have basically been reformed through persuasion , changing their mode of thinking , and exploring a law governing ideological and political work in the new age .  
However , facts have shown Hong Kong 's Falungong has a political purpose when its members exercise , it has reduced itself to the status of a political organization following Li Hongzhi 's order and targeting at the central government , and it has continued to engage in activities incompatible with the stated purpose when it registered itself as a social group .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
The list of US arms sales to Taiwan has been generally decided .  Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan held that safeguarding national security is the consistent stand of the ruling and opposition parties .  He also stressed that Taiwan must not pay attention to the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war . "  He said that obtaining weapons does not necessarily mean ensuring national defense security , and national defense security alone is not equivalent to national security and that real national security must have political support , which means stable cross-strait relations .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
After the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1958 , friendly and cooperative relations continued to develop , and bilateral cooperation achieved gratifying results in the political , economic , cultural , and public health fields .  
At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .  There is a universal call from various social circles on the Taiwan authorities to abandon the " Taiwan independence " ideology , stop political in-fighting , improve cross-strait relations , open three direct links [ postal , commercial , and air and shipping links ] , and concentrate on revitalizing the economy .  
Having sufficient weapons and equipment is merely one of the conditions for ensuring national security , and other important conditions include peaceful and stable cross-strait relations , brisk and active economic development and competitiveness , and a sound and mature democratic political system .  
Reportedly , although many proposals on adjusting China 's foreign policy have been sent to Zhongnanhai , as a leadership change at the upcoming 16th party congress is not far away , Jiang Zemin hopes to accomplish the transfer of power in a stable political environment , so the difficult policy issues will be left up to his successor .  Therefore , China will continue to maintain its existing foreign policy for the time being , and will continue to behave in a manner of " hiding its strength and biding its time " in international affairs .  
He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
As a matter of fact , that a rightwing politician like Koizumi can become the president of a ruling party and the prime minister of Japan and that an extreme rightwing politician like Shintaro Ishihara could be elected Tokyo Governor a few years ago have precisely reflected that the rightist trend is gaining momentum in Japan 's political arena .  
The procedure also stipulates that no Internet online service business sites are to be set up within 200 meters of such places as key central party , political , and military organs , within 200 meters of middle and elementary schools , and in residential buildings .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : At the present , along with the accelerating development of political multi-polarization and economic globalization , calls for democratization of international relations are running high with each passing day , while attempts to build a unipolar world have become increasingly unpopular and impossible .  
The foreign ministers stress that the international prestige of the " Shanghai Five " has been enhanced and it has become an increasingly influential positive factor in safeguarding regional and world peace , security , and stability .  It is also playing an important role in promoting the multipolarization of the world and establishing a new international political and economic order that is fair , reasonable , and democratic .  
Article 20 .  Military regions , provincial military districts ( including Beijing Garrison and other garrisons ) , military subdistricts ( including sub-garrisons ) , and the people 's armed forces departments of counties , autonomous counties , cities , and municipal districts shall conduct national defense education for militiamen and personnel on reserve duty in combination with political education , organizational rectification , military training , performance of services , conscription work , and activities on important festivals and commemoration days .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
Extensively promoting the educational campaign to study and put into practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of Party members is an important task of the military 's political work for this year , which was decided in accordance with the directive of the Central Military Commission . It also is an important measure and realistic procedure for improving the quality of Party members and strengthening Party-building throughout the military .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
Bao Tong 's " Confession " during his imprisonment in Qincheng Prison was published exactly under this awful political atmosphere , which sent me a profound feeling about the courage of that " person with high aspirations and determination " who has defied power in order to let justice prevail .  In addition , I have a feeling about the noble integrity of Bao Tong , who is " determined to leave a clean reputation in the world and has no fear for dying the most cruel death . "  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
Lai Changxing at that time relied on the network of connections he had woven over many years in key Party , government and military organs by wearing the hat of a private entrepreneur who was famous all over the country , a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference of Fujian Province and an honorary citizen of Xiamen City , among other political glories .  
China wishes to work hard together with peoples from Africa and other countries in the world , and to make new contributions to the construction of a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order , and to world peace and development .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
In addition to the ongoing economic restructuring and the changes in the external economic environment , the worsening economic situation in Taiwan was mainly caused by the turbulent political situation , the confused financial and economic policies , the uncertainty in cross-strait relations , and the shaken confidence among the people after the new government took power .  In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
Being a law that comprehensively regularizes the work of national defense education and provides the basic standards for organizing national defense education activities among the entire people , the National Defense Education Law should be seriously implemented by all state organs and armed forces , all political parties and social organizations , all enterprises and institutions , and all grass-roots mass self-management organizations .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
As a comprehensive law that regulates the work on national defense education , the " Law on National Defense Education " provides the basic rules for conducting activities related to national defense education for the whole people .  All state organs and armed forces , all political parties and social organizations , all enterprises and nonprofit institutions , and grassroots self-rule organizations of a mass nature should conscientiously implement it .  
and all departments in education , culture , propaganda , press , and publishing . "  It is stipulated in the " Law on National Defense Education " that all state organs and armed forces , all political parties and social organizations , all enterprises and nonprofit institutions , and grassroots self-rule organizations of a mass nature are obligated to conduct national defense education .  
Li Ruihuan said : The good political relationship between China and Libya has laid a solid foundation for developing economic and trade cooperation .  There is vast potential in such cooperation as their economies are highly complementary .  
After several months of diligent work , the task force uncovered the truth about rampant fraudulent claims for export tax rebates by some of the localities , units , and enterprises in the Chaoshan region .  They investigated to check if some large , key cases , and political and legal agencies followed the law in arresting criminal elements engaged in fraud .  Corrupt elements in party and political agencies and law enforcement departments with ties to criminal elements on the outside were also uncovered .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Party committees and political science and legal commissions at all levels must better guide and coordinate the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , work together to study and unify thinking on major cases and actions , and ensure the smooth and healthy progress of the strike-hard struggle .  
We must conduct a law-enforcement inspection drive while carrying out the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , make a special endeavor to resolve the pronounced problems facing the contingent of political and legal workers , resolutely purge the tiny number who have brought disgrace to the contingent , and vigorously commend and foster advanced models .  
During his " journey to establish communication , " Mr . Siew explained on many occasions that he favors adopting the model of European economic union under the current conditions of political deadlock across the Taiwan Strait to implement the concept of economic cooperation by shelving disputes and proceeding in an orderly and gradual manner and in stages in accordance with the " common market " formula .  
In the future , both sides of the strait should keep in mind regional union and national reunification , eliminate political interference from separatist forces , work to promote reciprocity and mutual benefit for both sides of the strait in economics and trade , and create a new win-win and mutually beneficial situation of cooperation and exchange .  
While cracking a number of major criminal gangs , public security organs in various places have also launched massive offensives of political propaganda to thoroughly crush the psychological defense of criminals .  The " Strike Hard " campaign has thus won another batch of victories .  
The following overall appraisals of Taiwan under the DPP " green ruling party " over the past year can be made : The political situation is chaotic , cross-strait relations continue to be tense , the economy is slipping tremendously , there is social unrest , and Taiwan not only has not " moved up , " it has instead continually " sunk downwards . "  
Political party politics is especially far from maturity - - the old system has been destroyed , but the new rules and new standards are not yet completely set up .  Even though the new system has already been established , it does not yet get its due respect and lacks authority , and the so-called " democratic system " does not exist .  Rather , the politicians lack " democratic accomplishments , " and the sudden turnover of political parties has inevitably led to violent political , economic , and social upheaval .  
In his speech , he pointed out : After the leader of the Taiwan authorities came into office , he deliberately adopted a vague and evasive position toward the issue of the one China principle , denied the " 1992 consensus , " openly stated that " reunification is not the only option " and " Taiwan is a state with independent sovereignty , " challenged the one China principle , brought cross-strait relations into an impasse , caused a chaotic political and economic situation to the island , and deeply upset the people .  
When giving a briefing about Cambodian 's domestic situation , Hun Sen said : Under the leadership of King Sihanouk , Cambodia terminated the civil war and the consequent domestic turmoil which lasted many years , realized national reconciliation , and moved onto the path of national reconstruction with the cooperation of all political parties inside the parliament .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
Li Donghai pointed out that in the past year the Taiwan authorities refusing to acknowledge the one China principle and sparing no efforts to deny the " 1992 consensus " reached by the two associations has led to a worsening and deterioration of cross-strait relations , and has also led to Taiwan being in a constant state of chaos .  The political and economic crises have worsened , the unemployment rate has unceasingly climbed upward , and complaints are heard everywhere from the majority of the public .  
However , at least before the election to be held by the end of this year , the current relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong suffers from no immediate and obvious conflict of political interests nor any unfavorable subjective and objective factors to their interactions .  Even if Lee Teng-hui vigorously reveals that the main character of the scandal of Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corporation is in fact Lien Chan , it still can not undermine the present relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong .  
Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
18 percent felt that fierce political fighting led to weakening economic competitiveness ; 15 percent attributed it to the authorities ' ideological command and inability to take proper steps ; and 6 percent felt that people have not put in sufficient efforts .  
The basis for the economic expert 's judgment is that the principal administrator is formulating policies on " political correctness . "  As a result , professional bureaucrats have lost their functions , the capable people have remained silent , and those who curry favor with the authorities for personal gain have followed the direction where the wind blows , thus resulting in corrupt political practice .  
A series of erroneous policies , such as the sudden announcements on the termination , and then the resumption of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant and the use of large sums from the " national stabilization fund " to support the stock market in order to fulfill political promises , have wasted energy , resulting in the loss of hope for Taiwan in the next decade .  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .  However , they spontaneously stressed the crucial role of developing cross-strait relations .  Some scholars pointed out that the authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has led people to lose hope .  
Jeb , who had attempted to ignore rumors about him in the public , was finally unable to hold himself back and declared that he was absolutely loyal to his wife and they had helped each other even when they were in humble circumstances for 27 years and that the sex scandal about him and Henderson was " a terrible lie , " which might have been used to serve political purposes .  
The European Parliament highly values the correct position adopted by China in the Asian financial crisis a few years ago , and is glad to see that China has made great achievements in its socialist modernization and in maintaining social stability , and enabling its people to live and work happily and peacefully .  It is willing to make joint efforts with the Chinese side in strengthening cooperation in the political , economic , trade , and financial fields , and make greater efforts to advance the comprehensive development of European-Chinese relations .  
In order to ensure the smooth enforcement of the government and military orders in a special natural , political , and social environment in Tibet , the Tibet Military District CPC Committee spelled out the following requirement in no uncertain terms : " Though there is a forbidden zone for life on the roof of the world , there is no special zone for enforcing the government and military orders here , " thus enhancing a sense of " unconditional submission " among the officers and men .  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy . "  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
During an interview by the press , Tang Yinlong said the Dalai is not just a religious figure , but also the general representative of the serf system in Tibet and a political refugee in the garb of religion who , over a long time , has engaged himself abroad in criminal activities of trying to split up the country and undermining unity among ethnic groups .  
As a matter of fact , in analyzing the major cause to the chaotic political situation in Taiwan , the public opinion and some political and academic figures on the island pointed out in the same way without prior consultation : First , in the past year since the leader of the Taiwan authorities took office , he has not taken actual measures to relax and improve cross-strait relations and to dispel the people 's misgiving about his seeking " Taiwan independence " and this has caused the Taiwan society to have an unstable external environment .  
In accordance with the UN charter and the acknowledged basic norms of international law , they should step up consultation , coordination , and cooperation , correctly handle the major political , security , and economic problems facing the international community , show proper concern for the interests and demands of the developing countries , and turn the AMEM into a major force in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order .  
While intensifying the aversion of most countries in the world to varying degrees , the so-called " unilateralism , " which is criticized by many countries , has also prompted many people of insight in the world to begin pondering numerous profound and lasting historical philosophic , political , and cultural issues , such as that in the new century , how different countries , different systems , and different cultures should make use of each other 's strong points for reference and respect each other ;  
Third , as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the biggest developing country in the world , China has persistently pursued an independent and good-neighborly foreign policy , advocated engaging all-directional dialogues with all regions of the world , including Europe , and promoted the establishment of a fairer and more rational international political and economic new order .  
To put it another way , we believe that like the natural world , the world of mankind is rich and colorful in nature , and the layout of world political and economic systems and order [ based on ] legal principles of international relations must fit and promote the realization of this diversity .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another . 
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .  Both the ruling and the opposition parties have been trying their utmost to break through an encirclement at the year-end legislative elections .  
During the visit , NPC Chairman Li Peng exchanged views with leaders of the national assemblies , governments , and political parties in the three countries on strengthening bilateral relations in the new century and on the current international and regional situations .  The visit has attained the aim of enhancing friendship , expanding consensus , and strengthening cooperation .  
The two countries have seen rapid development in exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields since they established diplomatic relations more than eight years ago .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
Leaders and political institutions at all levels should , in accordance with the criteria , select promising soldiers with outstanding moral and military integrity and excellent and crucial soldiers , heroic models and exemplary figures in preparing for war , performing their duty and carrying out significant tasks , so as to allow this policy to be an award and a guide in further arousing enthusiasm in loving the military and learning military skills among the majority of soldiers .  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
This essential character requires that military personnel of the new type should not only become military experts , but also be politically minded , politically sensitive , highly capable of making distinctions on political issues , firm in adhering to ideals and convictions , and pure ideologically and morally .  
During the initial days of reform , due to the heavy shackles of the " Left " thinking , reform met with strong obstruction .  In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
The US strategic adjustment is a new round of expansion under the conditions of the development of the political , economic , and military situation in the world and the necessary result of further consolidating the US position of being the sole superpower in the new century .  The defense group of the Bush administration has a strong color of " Cold War fighter " .  The essence of his " new pragmatism " is to use the strong power of the United States as basis to maximize its national interests .  
President Akayev said cheerfully that the fact that the fruitful activities of the " Shanghai Five " in recent years have drawn the attention of the international community has a lot to do with its growing international prestige in the region and in the world , with our successful solution of problems in the political , military , economic , trade and other spheres , and with the tremendous role we are playing in the protection of regional security .  
After the invasion of terrorists into southern Kyrgyzstan last year , it was a member of the " Shanghai Five " that first provided political , military and technical assistance to the country .  The collective security system of the Commonwealth of Independent States also played a positive part .  At present , the armed forces of Kyrgyzstan are bracing themselves for possible assaults from international terrorist forces .  
All military forces profoundly carried out and implemented the important strategy of administering the military according to the law , through which they have further raised their level of making decisions , administering the military , managing military training and managing soldiers all according to the law and have effectively accelerated ideological and political construction and the comprehensive construction of the military .  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
The tasks undertaken by the Bureau of Investigation and Analysis which has more than 7,000 staff and more than 70 intelligence stations all over the world are the most mysterious .  In simple terms , it is targeted against neighboring countries and major countries and through means like espionage and reconnaissance to collect and sort out the political , military , and economic intelligence of these countries and provide the most updated research and analysis results to the Government Cabinet of India . Meanwhile , it also possesses certain rebellion-instigating , subversive , and anti-espionage functions .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
Only by establishing a fair and reasonable international political , economic , and security new order and establishing a new security outlook based on mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , and cooperation can the world 's long-lasting peace and development be maintained and promoted .  
The municipal party committee explicitly requires : All major affairs in the capital city 's political , economic , cultural , and social life must be submitted to the Political Consultation Conference for deliberation .  In particular , before decisions are made on major projects and policies , before the change of administrative division of districts in the municipality , and before the formulation of local laws and regulations , political consultation must be conducted .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
They should continue to carry forward democracy and play a positive and active role in advancing the building of democratic politics in the capital , actively assist the party committee and the government in coordinating relations of all sides and resolving contradictions , thus safeguarding the social and political stability of the national capital .  
But what Taiwan lacks is not this factor .  Taiwan 's multi-party system and the very lacking and fantastically complex political-economic system including the spiritual state of her social , economic , political fronts , are the results of a relatively developed economy rather than relative backsliding .  
Recognizing this point , the contradictory standoff between social groups and government by political parties has lost the overriding standard of evaluation and criterion for constraint , has become muddled , and everything is like shifting sands and drifting clouds , completely without a common direction .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
Political reform not only has been affecting and constraining progress of the economic reform , but also has been affecting and constraining substantive progress in building democracy and the rule of law , as well as affecting and constraining the building of an effective power supervision and constraining mechanism needed to step up anti-corruption efforts , and affecting and constraining the maintenance and development of social stability and realization of long-term peace and stability .  Therefore , the task of reform of China 's political system is heavy and the way ahead is long .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the important " three represents " ideology advanced by Comrade Jiang Zemin has answered from a political , economic , and cultural point of view the basic questions of what type of party to build and how to build it .  It has given expression to a distinctly advanced characteristic , a scientifically innovative spirit , a broad , global view , and a staunch purpose for party building .  
Since the National Social Security Work Conference , Luo Gan pointed out , the party committee , government , and political and law departments at all levels have seriously implemented the spirit of the conference and swiftly launched the " strike hard " struggle focused on " attacking triads and eliminating crime " .  They have followed the law in severely and promptly cracking down on serious criminal offenders , started a high tide of the " strike hard " struggle , and scored initial successes .  
It is necessary to check the implementation of the spirit of the central directives and National Social Order Work Conference , examine whether the localities have dealt with the critical points in line with local reality , and review the effects of the " strike hard " struggle .  They should also inspect the cases jointly handled by the central political and law departments and localities , the crackdown on triads , the removal of the " protective umbrella " granted to the triad forces , as well as the difficulties and obstacles encountered in attacking triads .  
Jiang Zemin said that the sound political relations between China and Niger provide an effective safeguard for the development of bilateral economic cooperation and trade , noting that the two countries have carried out fruitful cooperation in the economic and trade fields and enterprises of both countries have made positive headway in mutually beneficial cooperation under the principles of sincerity , equality and mutual benefit . 
In recent years , your distinguished government has devoted itself to maintaining domestic political stability , vitalizing the national economy and promoting social progress , and has achieved positive results .  
China is willing to improve its communication and coordination with all nations , especially the vast number of developing countries , so as to push forward the development of world multipolarization and eliminate the imbalance and injustice brought by economic globalization , and to make unremitting efforts for building a fair , rational , and new international political and economic order as well as peace and progress that the people of all nations can enjoy .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
Since the sum of the gross national product of the APEC members account for half of the world 's total , he said , a strong voice issued by such an economic forum will serve as a political impetus for the launching of a new round of talks .  It will also have a direct and profound influence on the ongoing preparation work in Geneva .  
The social , economic , political , and military moves of any side will affect the reunification of China . The Democratic Progressive Party and Chen Shui-bian authorities are launching the " Taiwan independence " activities and are selling out Taiwan 's interest in collusion with the anti-China forces in the United States and Japan at the cost of making the people on both sides discouraged and disappointed at the peaceful reunification and afraid of the future . 
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
It critically incorporated British and French utopian socialism 's theory on fairness and justice in human society , the rational cores of dialectics of Germany 's classical philosophy and materialism , British classical political economy 's method for dissecting the capitalist economy , and intellectual pith in the latest achievements of natural sciences .  
In the field of the military strategy , with regard to the United States ' national missile defense plan which was widely criticized , this representative figure of the conservatives in the US political circles said that Washington was not subject to the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed with the former Soviet Union . He also " guaranteed " that the legislation for the deployment of the NMD system would be completed as soon as possible .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
Governments at all levels and various government departments should make the basic interests of the masses of people the starting point of all work and take effective measures to solve difficult problems of universal concern to the masses of people .  At present , we should do the following three tasks well : first , it is necessary to effectively strengthen public security work and to go all out to safeguard social and political stability .  
It is necessary to deeply study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , conduct more intensive education on the correct world and life outlook and correct values among law enforcement and police officers and judicial personnel , and make greater effort to build a high-quality law enforcement contingent with firm political stand , profession proficiency , good work style , and noble moral standards of being honest and uncorrupt  
Answer : A host of facts has proved that Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult organization have completely transformed into an out-and-out reactionary political organization and a political force and have become the tool of international anti-China forces and the splittist forces in Taiwan for subverting the political power of our people 's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system and for undermining national unification .  
The vigorous development of the CPC 's international liaison work was of great significance in new China 's efforts to break through the political isolation and economic blockade imposed by the Western countries , and in consolidating its newfound political power .  At that time , it also impacted on the peace and national liberation movements throughout the world .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
After that , the leaders of the five countries held regular annual meetings , and the contents of the meetings were extended from strengthening mutual trust in the border areas to across-the-board mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , security , diplomatic , economic , and trade fields among the five countries .  
Speaking at a recent symposium on financial and economic affairs , Central Bank Vice Governor Chen Shih-meng mentioned that , at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting he attended , many foreign businessmen maintained that they believed the Chinese Mainland would become the biggest market in the future , but that , owing to political and cultural factors , they had problems gaining direct access .  
The strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has continued to deepen in the new century .  This not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples but also conducive to promoting the process of a multi-polar world and to building a new , just , and rational international political and economic order .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
However , no other political organization had so many progressive elements as our party gathered , and was organized so tightly as our party , and made so great sacrifices for the Chinese nation , and could maintain so close ties with the people .  The party formed and maintained its correct theory and line as it was good at summing up experience in the course of advancing .  
Pay attention to intensifying the effort to analyze Western currents of political and cultural thinking , so as to reveal their reactionary nature , to make clear their decadent and harmful character , to enhance the sense of concern and the capacity to resist corruption and change , and to control armed forces ideologically and politically .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
In carrying out ideological and political education , the military must adhere to the main melody , vigorously advocate patriotism , collectivism , and the spirit of sacrifice , adhere to the purpose of serving the people whole-heartedly , adhere to principles of materialism , resolutely fight against idealism and feudal superstitions as well as decadent bourgeois lifestyles and various erroneous currents of thought and phenomena .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
On the sound basis of political mutual trust , China attaches importance to developing economic cooperation with neighboring countries and has actively uplifted economic cooperation to a higher level .  
The " Shanghai spirit " cultivated by the Shanghai Five process of mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , consultation , respect for cultural pluralism , and seeking common development , is a summary of the experiences of the five countries in handling mutual relations ; in addition , it is of important practical significance in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order of justice and reason .  
He spoke highly of the important role of the corps in production , construction , consolidating frontier defense , maintaining stability , and promoting ethnic solidarity , and encouraged its members to keep firmly in mind the heavy tasks entrusted them by the party and the people , further increase their sense of the historical mission and political responsibility of defending the border area and doing farm work there , and give full play to their role of a mainstay in promoting Xinjiang 's economic and social development and maintaining Xinjiang 's stability .  
The Common Program solemnly announced the abolition of the feudal system , which had shackled women .  Women were to enjoy the same political , economic , cultural , educational , and other social rights as men .  It cut the four ropes that had bound Chinese women , namely , the political system , clan power , religious authority , and the authority of their husbands , and ushered in a new era in the liberation of Chinese women . "  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .  The HKSAR Government must assume responsibility for the security and stability of Hong Kong . Hence , the government 's stance and methods are totally reasonable and necessary .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The sovereignty of each newly independent country , even the political stability of the whole region , are threatened by the continuous illegal Chechnya military terrorist acts , the long-lasting Afghan war , the influence of Islamic fundamentalism and the chaotic drug and arms smuggling .  The furious terrorism , separatism and extremism especially endanger the region .  
Taking advantage of the complex social factors and the transnational geological condition in the Feiergan valley , international terrorist forces repeatedly carried out terrorist activities in Kyrgyzstan and south Uzbekistan in 1999 and 2000 .  In addition , due to the various political effects from both inside and outside the region , relevant countries and the whole Eurasian area face unprecedented threats to stability .  
During his 12 years in power , Lee Teng-hui played political trickery to the utmost , excluded those not agreeing with him , was tyrannical and domineering , and , mechanically copying the Western parliamentary democracy model , directed several " constitutional amendments " and elections , prompting Taiwan to become a place " filled with a sense of confrontation and hatred " and distorting all mechanisms of a modern democratic society .  
The statement read : " This newspaper will learn a profound lesson from this incident and take effective measures to adopt correct guiding principles for newspaper management , thoroughly implement the principle of ' newspaper management based on political considerations , ' and improve newspaper management by adhering to the policy of fostering unity and stability , serving as an inspirational force , and stressing positive propaganda and by correctly shaping public opinion .  We will do our best to give wide publicity to reform , opening up , and socialist modernization . "  
The third generation of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has shown great foresight , managed the overall situation , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , continued to deepen reform and expanded opening up , vigorously advanced the building of the socialist market economy system , surmounted difficulties , overcome all kinds of risks from political and economic fields as well as from nature , and succeeded in realizing a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and safeguarding social and political stability .  
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
Since this is the first year of the Tenth Five-year Plan and a crucial moment in China 's forthcoming WTO entry , assessments of this year 's implementation of the Tenth Five-year Plan and the international and domestic political , economic , and social environments in the first half of the year will be made at the Beidaihe meeting .  
The two governments agreed to develop bilateral relations of friendly cooperation on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-intervention in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  They also agreed that while maintaining good political relations , efforts would be made to actively open up exchanges and cooperation in other fields , especially in economy and trade .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .  
the disparities related to major political principles must be criticized and corrected in an unambiguous way , and political guidance should be given to achieve new unity on the new basis .  Thus , the united front may always maintain a relaxed , stable , united , and harmonious political environment inside .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , under the guidance of the party three-generation leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core and , through the unremitting hard work of all party members and the people of all nationalities across the country , who have united as one in their struggle , tremendous changes of historic significance have taken place in the economic , political , cultural , and social features of China .  
Chen noted : Taiwan is currently in an economic recession , suffering from declining industries and a rising unemployment rate , and this has caused pains to the people .  Truly , Taiwan is faced , it can be said , with " a myriad of political issues and countless pressing problems . "  
The fourth is the tradition of deep affection for the motherland and hometown .  They constantly show concern for the economic , political , and social development of the motherland , as well as the living conditions of their beloved ones , consider it as an honor to be able to make contributions to their fellow countrymen , and take pride in the magnificent and long-standing history and culture of their nation .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
According to Cheng Yun-peng , director of the publicity department of the DPP , who accompanied him to visit Lee , the atmosphere of the talks was relaxed and harmonious .  They talked about the political and economic situation in Taiwan . In addition , since the host and the guest share the same background of having studied in Japan , they also exchanged views on Japan 's current situations and Taiwan-Japan relations .  
The statement says that " in the past year , Lee Teng-hui has retired , but has continued to frequently make use of provincial sentiments to create ideological confrontation to satisfy his personal political desires in his attempt to bring about a complete split of the country .  This really has made us Chinese abroad feel angry . "  
Referring to rumors , such as the narrow candidate choice for Li 's political group , difficulties in raising campaign funds and objection from Madame Li Teng-hui , a key person involved in the political group 's policy-making emphasized that these are a series of mudslinging tricks played by ambitious people intentionally .  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
We should understand the political value of the important thinking of the " three represents , " not only in light of the international environment faced by our country but also in light of the domestic tasks to be completed , particularly social issues .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
He said that in recent years the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries of China and Cuba have developed rapidly , there has been mutual understanding and support in the political field , economic cooperation has unceasingly expanded , various exchanges have increased day by day , and there is close cooperation in the midst of international struggle .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
Why has our Party been able to have become eminent among various political forces in modern Chinese society , turned from small to big and from weak to strong , developed from only more than 50 people at the very beginning to the biggest ruling party in the world with more than 64-million Party members , and achieved these brilliant achievements ? 
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
China must be led by a progressive political party armed with advanced ideology and only thus can national liberation and regeneration be realized .  This is the conclusion drawn from the modern history of China .  
We have actively advocated and safeguarded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics with the strong domineering over the weak .  We have upheld principle and justice , striving to let justice prevail and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the vast developing countries , and pushed the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
The purpose of the new democratic revolution led by our party was to abrogate the imperialist privileges in China , eliminate exploitation and oppression by the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class , change the comprador feudal production relations and the rotten political superstructure built on such an economic base , establish a new political superstructure with the people 's democratic dictatorship as the core and fundamentally emancipate the fettered productive forces .  
Over the past 20-plus years , we have conducted bold explorations and practices and pushed forward the reforms in economic and political structures and other areas and greatly emancipated and developed China 's social productive forces , thereby bringing about tremendous changes in national economic development and social progress .  
To always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party must , in all kinds of work including party 's theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and ultimate goal , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
Our party should always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  Our party must , in all kinds of work including party theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking in the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and purpose , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of the personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
With the development of reform , opening up , and modernization , the Chinese working class has expanded steadily .  The quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of their political awareness , moral standards , scientific and technical and educational level .  It has become more progressive .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of cadres who are more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and more competent professionally and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber officials who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
and the party 's leading collective of the third generation has the extraordinary political wisdom and the superb capability to keep a complicated situation under control , and is a firm leading collective that leads the whole party and the people of the entire country to constantly push forward the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Through development of more than 50 years , especially in the development of reform and opening up during the past two decades , China has established important ideological and political foundation and possessed a material , technological and human resource foundation for achieving the main modernization by the middle of this century .  
and was an out and out dictator .  He blindly followed western parliamentary and democratic elections in disregard of specific conditions , which caused endless wrangles among parties and factions , continuous upheaval in the political situation , and serious economic losses .  
Everyone held that upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces is a great creation of our party and a political strong point unique to our armed forces , and is also the fundamental guarantee for our armed forces always being in an invincible position .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
toppled the three big mountains [ imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucrat-capitalism ] , built new China , and ended the tragic fate where our country was like a sheet of loose sand [ in a state of disunity ] , was rent by disunity , and allowed itself to be trampled upon .  We underwent socialist construction , broke blockades , consolidated our political power , achieved self-reliance , fought hard , and fought against heaven and earth in the Daqing oilfield .  
given a concentrated expression to the latest achievements in theoretical innovation that have been attained by the party 's leading collective of the third generation ; and is therefore an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory on political parties .  The important thinking of " three represents " has pointed out the direction for our efforts to push forward the great project of strengthening party building under the present new historical conditions and to subsequently attain constant new victories in the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
For the first time , it gives a systematical reply to a series of basic questions concerning the development course of socialism , development stage of socialism , fundamental tasks of socialism , development driving forces , external conditions , political guarantees , strategic steps , the party 's leadership , the reliable forces , and the motherland 's reunification in China . It guides our party to formulate its basic line in the initial stage of socialism .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
They are all determined to , under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , deeply implement the principles and policies of the central leadership for the Taiwan issue , keep a strong sense of political responsibility , work hard to break new ground and make solid progress , unite compatriots on both sides of the straits and overseas compatriots to fight against all separatist attempts , and make contributions to the accomplishment of the motherland 's reunification at an earlier date .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin mentioned that it is necessary to uphold and perfect the system of people 's congress , the multiparty cooperation system under the leadership of the communist party , and the system of political consultation and regional national autonomy , actively , safely , and steadily push forward the reform of political structure , further expand the democracy of socialism , govern the country according to law , and build a socialist country ruled by law .  
According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .  By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
In and after the 1980 ' s , our party also began to establish friendly relations with leftist , centralist , and right-wing political parties and their international organizations in the Western countries by transcending ideological differences and the disparity of social systems with the spirit of seeking understanding , dialogue , and cooperation .  
and it was a programmatic document guiding us in the new millennium to comprehensively promote the party 's construction of grand new projects , and to comprehensively promote the grand cause of the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The troops throughout the entire military must thoroughly understand the vital significance of General Secretary Jiang 's speech , make studying and implementing the speech a significant political mission and a long term strategic mission , and lose no time in firmly grasping these missions .  
The session reached a comprehensive consensus on the 12 questions left over from the multilateral talks , including agricultural and industrial subsidies , trade rights , a transitional review mechanism on China , and other important issues , Long Yongtu said , adding that the political and substantial questions related to China 's accession to the WTO have been resolved . 
The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .  
Over the past year since political power changed hands , however , it is most regrettable to find that the SEF has been totally frozen out , and the public can no longer see the scenes of Director Koo Chen-fu , surrounded by reporters , narrating his optimistic views on the future prospects of cross-strait relations in a mild yet firm tone . 
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina Patricio Echegaray , and the Party 's Secretary for International Relations Athos Fava , said in a congratulatory telegram to Jiang Zemin , " The Chinese Communist Party , established 80 years ago by a small number of revolutionaries in the historically famous city of Shanghai , proposed the objective of seizing political power and establishing socialist society .  It seized power within the relatively short span of 28 years .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
However , some of the outstanding problems in the Party , especially problems among leading cadres with regard to Party spirit and conduct , were not solved .  A considerable number of leading cadres still fail to meet or completely meet the requirements in carrying out their tasks and keep pace with the current situation in the ideological and political realm .  
Western countries such as the United States have set a bad precedent in international law by playing with double political and legal standards and pushing into the dock the leaders of countries whom they regard as a nail in the eye , and this is bound to be condemned by the international community .  
The circular points out : Party committees and political organs at all levels should include the work of giving help to poor areas in their work agenda , make well-coordinated and careful arrangements , formulate concrete plans and work measures , and be strict to enhance the comprehensive efficiency in the work of poverty relief and development according to the specific conditions of the local areas where the troops are stationed . 
We should comprehensively implement the principle on promoting younger , better educated , more professionally competent , and revolutionary cadres and the criterion on both ability and political integrity , exercise strict education and management on party member-cadres , pay keen attention to recruiting new party members from among outstanding young and middle-aged students and teachers , further strengthen the cohesive power and creativity of party organizations of schools of higher learning , and provide strong and effective political guarantee for reform , development , and stability of the cause of higher education .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
Second , we must throw ourselves into red-hot revolution and construct reality , research the actual major questions of the Party , the government and the masses , and provide an accurate direction for public opinion and support for spiritual intelligence for the great leap forward in Tibetan development and long-term political stability .  This is the glorious and important responsibility of workers in the social sciences .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
But contrary to his expectations , the " green " regime got off to a rough start , the chaotic political and economic situation has worsened on the island , the stalemate in the cross-strait relations continues , and the popular anger boils over .  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
The provincial military district system , in accordance with relevant regulations at a national level and in the military , integrate political education , organization and rectification , military training , recruitment work , and major holiday and commemoration activities , accomplishing national defense of civilian militia reserves .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
Since the first visit by President Yeltsin to China in December 1992 , the cooperation between the two countries in all fields rapidly developed and the exchanges between the two countries in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural and other fields became increasingly frequent and close .  According to statistics , in 1993 the number of visits between delegations of the two countries above the vice ministerial level reached 25 ; and in 1994 it reached 36 .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
Mutual political trust between the two sides has been further strengthened , trade and economic , science and technology cooperation have been gradually expanded , exchanges between local governments and non-government contacts have been constantly developed , and outstanding results have been obtained in cooperation in international affairs .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
The " Sino-Russian Good-Neighborly Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation , " signed by the heads of state of China and Russia , has laid down the principle and direction for the two countries to carry out cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and humanity fields , as well as in the international arena .  As a programmatic document for guiding development of Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century , the treaty is bound to raise relations between the two countries to a higher level .  
With the direct concern shown and efforts made by the heads of state of the two countries , exchange of high-level visits between China and Russia has been frequent , and the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , science and technological , cultural , educational , and other fields has continued to develop , and the results have been notable .  
The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
Second , with regard to the principle of noninterference in internal affairs , the treaty advocates transcending ideology and not interfering in the choice of the other party 's road for political , economic , social , and cultural development adopted in light of its national conditions .  
The communique says , the two leaders affirm that their stances on a whole series of major international issues are identical or similar ; both advocate strengthening their coordination and close cooperation within the framework of the United Nations and other international organizations , and will make joint efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
We are willing to continue to strengthen cooperation in the international arena and make joint efforts to promote the establishment of a democratic , fair and rational new international political and economic order and to create a new world of lasting peace and universal prosperity .  
Lukashenko said Belarus and China take the same stand on major international issues , including the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order .  Both sides call for adhering to the principles of sovereignty , equality , territorial integrity , noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries , and other basic principles governing international relations .  Both sides also persistently safeguard the security structure and stability of the world today and are opposed to undermining the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty . "  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
Over the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , relations of bilateral cooperation have developed smoothly .  There have been frequent mutual visits at a high level and the two sides have established a basic framework and principle for cooperation in political , economic , trade , cultural and other fields .  
You have always maintained the true political qualities of being loyal to the party , to the country , to the people and to socialism .  You have resolutely waged struggles against western hostile forces and the national splittists , won great victories in suppressing rebels and bandits and in the self-defense counterattack , forcefully maintained border and social stability in Tibet , and defended our state sovereignty , territorial integrity and national unity .  
11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .  
Since China and Ukraine established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , educational , cultural , sports , and other fields between our two countries have continued to broaden , and encouraging results have been achieved .  
Both sides are continuously expanding and deepening cooperation and exchange in the political , economic and trade , scientific and technological , educational , cultural fields , and maintain the fine tradition of positive consultation and close cooperation in international affairs .  Satisfactory results have been achieved .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
Fu Quanyou called for the leading cadres in the General Staff Headquarters to take the lead in improving the style of exercising leadership , voluntarily subject themselves to the supervision of the party organizations and the masses , enable themselves to withstand political tests and resist economic temptations , adhere to the principles in wielding their powers , maintain their moral integrity , and build up a good image of being faithful to their duties , working diligently in a down-to-earth manner , and being honest and incorruptible .  
Through the propaganda , we have been greatly touched and enhanced our thinking .  Chi Haotian said that through the propaganda campaign , the reporters have shown a high degree of revolutionary dedication and a strong sense of political responsibility .  With valuable professional dedication and despite difficulties and obstacles , these reporters went deep to frontier companies and forward posts , boldly faced hardships , worked indomitably , covered a lot of outstanding , brilliant , and touching news reports , and did a good job in performing their sacred missions and lofty duties .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
At present , the international situation is complex and dynamic , our reform and construction are at a crucial moment of development and our Party 's self-construction is in a new stage of development .  Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " will greatly accelerate theory innovation , system innovation and scientific and technological innovation in our Party and our country .  The PLA is an important force to embody the Party 's and the national political advantages .  
We have a system to establish political commissioners and political institutions .  We also have a system to base Party branches on the military units at the company level .  The availability of and the adherence to these systems enables our military to ensure the military remains under the Party 's firm control despite the dynamic historical conditions and constant changes in members of the military .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
Reform is being carried out under the complicated environment at home and abroad .  It is faced with the interference and sabotage of the hostile forces .  This demands that we further enhance our political awareness , adopt a firm and clear-cut stand in our major political struggles , and resolutely safeguard the Party 's leadership and the socialist system .  
It also has a bearing on the rise or fall of the Chinese nation .  It will also determine whether or not our army can always become the effective tool to fulfill the Party 's political tasks under the new situation .  Therefore , to continuously arm our army with military equipment of advanced technology , enhance our army 's fighting power , and fulfill the Party 's highest political requirements in " fighting to win " should be our army 's basic task in upholding the Party 's absolute leadership over the army under the new situation .  
Through study , further improve the capability for observing and handling issues from a political perspective , achieve a profound understanding of the spirit of advancing with the passage of time , work hard to adapt to the profound changes in the party ' s tasks and ruling environment , and change outdated ideas , practices , and working mechanisms .  
As a powerful ideological weapon and tremendous spiritual motivation for army building , the " three represents " constitute a reliable guarantee of the army 's always keeping a firm and correct political orientation .  
make great efforts to build a contingent of high-caliber cadres in accordance with the guiding principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and the principle of attaching equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity ;  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech comprehensively , systematically , and incisively revealed the scientific implications of the " three represents " thinking .  On the basis of comprehensively summarizing the historical experience in party building over the last 80 years , he profoundly analyzed the social , economic , and political changes which have taken place since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program .  He also briefly defined the party 's nature , aim , and missions anew , showing us clearly the way forward .  
Since the peaceful liberation 50 years ago , Tibet has witnessed profound social changes , including the democratic reform as well as reform and opening up , and has scored world-renowned successes in its political , economic , and cultural development .  
We should learn from them their true political qualities of carrying forward and developing the glorious traditions of our party and our army , consciously resisting temptations , firmly holding the defense line , and always " resisting and keeping away from corrosive influences . "  We should learn from them their up-to-the-mark work style of running the inspection post strictly , ensuring a strict enforcement of the law , stressing on decorum , and observing discipline .  
Wang Lequan said that due to the daily convolution of the international situation , as we entered the 1990s , the international Islamic fundamentalist forces began to rear their ugly face , and they ran rampant in their activities .  Under the influence of international forces , within our borders , minority separatists and religious radicals harboring political schemes have been incited and encouraged , and they have created a definite unfavorable influence on Xinjiang 's social and political stability .  However , Xinjiang correctly implemented national minority and religious policies ;  
in terms of new development , the important concept of " three represents " has enriched and developed the Marxist theory of political parties , classes , and the masses according to the fundamental tenets of Marxism on the relationship between the productive forces and production and between the economic base and the superstructure , by keeping the new century in mind , and by proceeding from the laws of social development and the basic nature of the party ;  
An official of US Defense Department who asked not to be named said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish with Russia complete , normal , and friendly relations in the economic , political , military , and other fields , as a solid foundation for security and stability , and that , in this process , the two countries will simultaneously recede from the " ABM Treaty . "  
Zhao Leji , a native of Qinghai , has made himself conspicuous within a very short period of time in recent years , and is now the youngest governor in the country .  He is considered to enjoy a promising political future , and there is wide speculation that he will become one of state leaders of the new generation .  
An unidentified official of the US Defense Department said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish all-round normal and friendly relations in the economic , political , and military fields with Russia as a solid foundation for security and stability , and hoped that both sides would agree to withdraw from the ABM Treaty at the same time .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
The " Ordinance " points out : Command automation work is a large systems engineering project that organically amalgamates diverse professional work , has extremely complex lateral links , vertically threads together various levels of command , and involves all fields of army building .  To do this job well is the common responsibility of relevant professional departments of commanding , political , logistics , and armament organs at all levels .  
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
It is just like what has transpired in the past - - when all previous Japanese prime ministers and political heavyweights visited the Yasukuni Shrine , the feelings of the people from every victimized country in Asia were hurt , and the alarm bell was sounded alerting to the resurgence of militarism .  This has led to tense relations between Japan and its neighboring countries , and has also caused Japan 's international image to be coarsened even more .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
Nevertheless , how can such a country - - a country that has yet to liquidate its aggressive history and make official apologies and compensations to the aggression-inflicted countries and whose political leaders , including the prime minister , have from time to time tried to " call back the dead souls " of its militarists , denied or beautified its aggression , and continued to hurt the feeling of the countries and peoples concerned - - be qualified to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council ?  
According to information , the Chinese Foreign Ministry explicitly stated in its reply to the Japanese Foreign Ministry that in deliberately paying respects to the Yasukuni Shrine which enshrines the tablets of 14 class-A war criminals of World War II , Prime Minister Koizumi has damaged the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian countries that fell victim , and this is bound to affect the healthy development of Sino-Japanese relations .  
The Jinan Military Region especially held a training class for retiring political commissars at rest homes and some retired veteran cadres in order to have sufficient backbone instructors to guide the study by veteran cadres of the entire military region .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that speeding up the perfection of the social security system is the urgent requirement of preserving social stability and consolidating and developing the current good development momentum , and is also a strategic move for achieving lasting political stability .  
To align the personal quality of these professional soldiers with the requirements of the rank of nomcom as soon as possible , people who have obtained the rank of noncom must understand their position and role in military construction , be aware of their duties and have a strong sense of urgency regarding learning information about organization , training , and education and about administrating soldiers , so as to improve their overall quality in the military and in political fields .  
Behind the moves of Japanese political figures ' homage visits to Yasukuni Shrine are the deeply entrenched rightwing mentality in post-war Japan , radical and narrow-minded nationalist feelings , and the sustained economic depression , which has accelerated the right deviationist thinking in the Japanese society .  
As Bush said that he regarded China as a " strategic competitor " during his election campaign , Henry Kissinger pointed out : Bush 's viewpoint is just an " immature expression aimed at pleasing the conservatives and the hard-liners in the Republican Party . " A noticeable fact is that inside US political circles , there exists a hawkish camp and a dovish camp , and the influence of the two camps may change along with the changes in the domestic politics .  
Qian Qichen said in his speech , international nongovernmental organizations have developed very rapidly in recent years ; they have played an increasingly important role in international political , economic , military , cultural , and social fields , and have become a force that can not be neglected in the international arena .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
Together with Political Commissar Liu Shaoqi and other comrades , he reorganized the troops , summed up experience and lessons , strengthened party leadership and ideological and political building among the troops , and thus turned the New Fourth Army into an invincible anti-Japanese army fighting north and south of the Chang Jiang and striking terror into the enemy troops .  
Party committees , governments , and political and legal organs at various levels must have a better understanding , firmly implement the spirit of the national conference on public order work , overcome the mood of relaxation and struggle-weariness , further buttress confidence , and be determined to carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order unremittingly through to the end .  We must further highlight the key areas of struggle ;  
For example , the health of Tang Yao-ming has become a political issue because of his position .  When the media learned that he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder , they sought confirmation from the military before reporting on it .  However , the military broke the news first by publishing Tang Yao-ming 's surgery on Ching-Nien Jih-Pao . Thus , the media were unable to break the news .  This struck a great fear into journalism and the media can no longer trust the directive to " confirm all matters through the spokesman . "  
Guidance should be given to retired cadres as to broadening their horizons , updating their concepts , acquiring a profound understanding of the major theoretical and practical significance of the " speech , " maintaining political staunchness , frequently renewing their thinking , keeping up with the times , and always preserving the nature of CPC members .  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
Non-public-run economic organizations , social bodies , and civilian-run non-enterprise units are emerging in large numbers , and are producing a major influence on the economic , cultural , and social development of our country .  To guide these economic and social bodies to attain a healthy development , we need to have correct principles and policies as well as a perfect legal system , and we also need to strengthen the party 's political leadership .  
Through this window , people can feel that China , a country with a stable political environment , with an increasingly developed economy , with ethnic unity , with social progress and with increasingly greater overall national strength , stands in the East and is a major credit to maintaining global peace and development .  
He praised the overseas Chinese in the United States for ceaselessly working to strengthen themselves , uniting in endeavor , engaging in arduous pioneering , and not only fusing into mainstream society but also enhancing their economic and political status .  At the same time he saluted the overseas Chinese for actively taking part in building the motherland , supporting the motherland 's cause of peaceful reunification , and promoting the positive development of Sino-US relations .  
4 .  The two sides agreed that the two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , public health , and scientific and technological fields had brought tangible benefits to both countries and their people .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
we must comprehensively implement the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity , deepen the reform of personnel system , and strive to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the tests of trials and tribulations ;  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
After Jiang Zemin spoke , Zhang Wannian said that Chairman Jiang 's important speech was imbued throughout with Marxist world-view and methodology and filled with the truth-seeking and innovative spirit of emancipating the mind and moving with the times ; its political , theoretical , ideological , and targeted properties were extremely strong , it has further pointed out the orientation for the whole party and the whole army to study in depth and implement the 1 July speech and fully implement the demands of the " three represents , " and is of major guiding significance .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
We have of late paid a visit to a certain air strike division of the Chinese Air Force , a hero unit known far and wide for its military prowess in the southeast , and interviewed the division 's Commander Zhang and political Commissar Su . What we saw and heard there has left us such a deep impression that the " fist " flight division has all along remained as a vanguard .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
Zhu Bangzao said : The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on further strengthening diverse cooperative relations between China and the four countries in the political , economic , trade , and cultural fields , and on international and regional issues , such as the establishment of a new international political and economic order , the Middle East issue , the Gulf situation , and the Iraq issue .  They reached broad consensus .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
A tremendous change , which is hardly detected by people , has occurred in the trend of China 's political thinking .  The change has occurred since China launched the drive of reform and opening up about 20 years ago .  The trend shows that a rational democratic concept and attitude has begun to be the main stream of social life , enabling China to have a very important and stable foundation for further political reform .  
Since the May Fourth Movement , the struggles engaged by the Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have always been accompanied by fierce political movements , with passionate mass parades and fervent slogans which are spread nationwide in a short period of time .  
Democracy must serve to resolve contemporary urgent social , political , or economic problems .  A parallel thinking is this : Whenever a political , economic , or social problem can not be resolved , people naturally pin their hopes on democracy .  
The great and universal imperial power has suppressed all democratic practices that seem promising .  It has made budding democracy disappear in the long river of history by killing it in the bud .  As a result , democracy has not been able to form a tradition in our political culture , or become a tradition of non-main stream .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
On the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : Taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .  Take its geographical conditions for an example .  Taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high-performance weapons into play .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
In the past year , the Chinese Government has made efforts to realize the people 's economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to promote and protect the citizens ' political rights , and has made remarkable progress in this respect , thus comprehensively raising the level of enjoying various human rights by the Chinese people .  
The Chinese Government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .  
Providing a panoramic view of the government 's work , this over-15,000-character Government Work Report is composed of 10 parts which cover the political , economic , social , and cultural fields , with more than half of its space devoted to economy-related contents .  Such a fact not only tallies with China 's present principle of " centering everything on the economy , " but has precisely reflected the expertise of this premier in economic management .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
The draft law specifically stipulates that it is the exclusive authority of the NPC and its standing committee to legislate the ten categories of laws that have a bearing on the state 's basic political system , economic system and legal system including civil and criminal laws , an authority that covers such fields as the deprival of civil and political rights , the punishment in terms of restricting the right to personal freedom , and litigation and arbitration systems .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
To safeguard the interests of their own bourgeois class , Western countries headed by the United States have used political , economic , and military means to enforce their political system , ideology , and human rights concept in the international community and to grossly interfere in the internal affairs and trample on the sovereignty of other countries .  
Most Taiwan securities dealers dared not be optimistic over the prospects of Taiwan 's securities markets in the future .  They believe : After undergoing a drastic change in its government , Taiwan will probably face drastic changes in its political and economic situations .  Moreover , since Taiwan investors are worried about the prospects of cross-strait ties , they will rush to sell off their shares .  They expected Taiwan stock market prices would successively plummet in the near future .  Most securities analysts are pessimistic and refused to predict how long the bearish market will last .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
In the latter half of the nineties , after the new constitution was endorsed in a referendum , Russia set up a presidential system and a republican regime , and Yeltsin was elected president .  However , his ties with the number one political party , Communist Party of the Russian Federation [ CPRF ] , worsened .  Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .  
It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
Both countries are developing counties ; and it is the hope of our both countries to give form to a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order at an early date .  
China 's diplomatic policy is to develop friendly ties of cooperation with all countries in the world based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , Zhu stated .  China is willing to further develop cooperation with Iran in the political , economic , and cultural fields .  
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .  
The central leadership holds that the appointments of new principal leaders to the State Sports General Bureau are proper , and the new leaders can support each other with their own strong points .  Zhang Bolin also put forward some requirements for the future work of the State Sports General Bureau : Enhance the sense of political responsibility , continue to advance the reform and development of sports ; consolidate and expand the results of " three stress " education , do a good job in party building and contingent building ;  
Luo Gan , secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission , who is in personal charge of this , has called on the state security departments , as well as the public security and armed police officers , in all localities to draw up meticulous plans and strike hard at the key Falungong elements who stir up trouble , in order to maintain political and social stability .  
The unitary state political system has played a tremendous role in promoting ethnic unity among the 56 ethnic groups , national unity , the coordinated development of various regions , and common prosperity .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .

Since the May Fourth Movement , the struggles engaged by the Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have always been accompanied by fierce political movements , with passionate mass parades and fervent slogans which are spread nationwide in a short period of time .  
Democracy must serve to resolve contemporary urgent social , political , or economic problems .  A parallel thinking is this : Whenever a political , economic , or social problem can not be resolved , people naturally pin their hopes on democracy .  
The great and universal imperial power has suppressed all democratic practices that seem promising .  It has made budding democracy disappear in the long river of history by killing it in the bud .  As a result , democracy has not been able to form a tradition in our political culture , or become a tradition of non-main stream .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
On the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : Taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .  Take its geographical conditions for an example .  Taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high-performance weapons into play .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
In the past year , the Chinese Government has made efforts to realize the people 's economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to promote and protect the citizens ' political rights , and has made remarkable progress in this respect , thus comprehensively raising the level of enjoying various human rights by the Chinese people .  
The Chinese Government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .  
Providing a panoramic view of the government 's work , this over-15,000-character Government Work Report is composed of 10 parts which cover the political , economic , social , and cultural fields , with more than half of its space devoted to economy-related contents .  Such a fact not only tallies with China 's present principle of " centering everything on the economy , " but has precisely reflected the expertise of this premier in economic management .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
The draft law specifically stipulates that it is the exclusive authority of the NPC and its standing committee to legislate the ten categories of laws that have a bearing on the state 's basic political system , economic system and legal system including civil and criminal laws , an authority that covers such fields as the deprival of civil and political rights , the punishment in terms of restricting the right to personal freedom , and litigation and arbitration systems .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
To safeguard the interests of their own bourgeois class , Western countries headed by the United States have used political , economic , and military means to enforce their political system , ideology , and human rights concept in the international community and to grossly interfere in the internal affairs and trample on the sovereignty of other countries .  
Most Taiwan securities dealers dared not be optimistic over the prospects of Taiwan 's securities markets in the future .  They believe : After undergoing a drastic change in its government , Taiwan will probably face drastic changes in its political and economic situations .  Moreover , since Taiwan investors are worried about the prospects of cross-strait ties , they will rush to sell off their shares .  They expected Taiwan stock market prices would successively plummet in the near future .  Most securities analysts are pessimistic and refused to predict how long the bearish market will last .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
In the latter half of the nineties , after the new constitution was endorsed in a referendum , Russia set up a presidential system and a republican regime , and Yeltsin was elected president .  However , his ties with the number one political party , Communist Party of the Russian Federation [ CPRF ] , worsened .  Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .  
It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
Both countries are developing counties ; and it is the hope of our both countries to give form to a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order at an early date .  
China 's diplomatic policy is to develop friendly ties of cooperation with all countries in the world based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , Zhu stated .  China is willing to further develop cooperation with Iran in the political , economic , and cultural fields .  
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .  
The central leadership holds that the appointments of new principal leaders to the State Sports General Bureau are proper , and the new leaders can support each other with their own strong points .  Zhang Bolin also put forward some requirements for the future work of the State Sports General Bureau : Enhance the sense of political responsibility , continue to advance the reform and development of sports ; consolidate and expand the results of " three stress " education , do a good job in party building and contingent building ;  
Luo Gan , secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission , who is in personal charge of this , has called on the state security departments , as well as the public security and armed police officers , in all localities to draw up meticulous plans and strike hard at the key Falungong elements who stir up trouble , in order to maintain political and social stability .  
The unitary state political system has played a tremendous role in promoting ethnic unity among the 56 ethnic groups , national unity , the coordinated development of various regions , and common prosperity .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
It should give full play to its political nucleus role and set a correct direction , goal and task for the development of Chinese culture .  It should formulate a correct line , guiding principle and policy , provide a staunch cultural and organizational guarantee and become the leader of the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  
It is reported that Guangzhou City held a national defense mobilization meeting last month .  Huang Huahua , secretary of the Guangzhou City CPC Committee , chaired the meeting in his capacity as the first political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region . He called on the relevant quarters in the city to seriously do good preparatory work for military struggle in the new period in accordance with the central authorities ' arrangements .  
He pointed out that under the unified leadership of the central authorities , the military and armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs regarded implementing the central policy decision as a serious political task and assigned it an important position ; they swept into action with a high sense of political responsibility and sense of work urgency , and got a really good grasp of implementation , with the result that this work has continually proceeded in a healthy and orderly way .  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
Through carrying out this work , not only have the military , armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs undergone testing in stressing politics , taking account of the overall situation , and observing discipline ; we have also found a number of effective measures and summed up a number of successful experiences , which provide a useful reference for unfolding specific items of tidying things up in the future .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
If in the future a problem again arises of some unit of the military , the armed police , or the political and legal organs engaging in business activities , we will hold accountable not only those directly responsible but also the leaders of that unit in accordance with the regulations on building good party style and clean government , and will strictly discipline them .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
We should make vigorous efforts to strengthen the building of political power at the grass-roots level in rural areas and turn them into strong fighting bastions to prevent and crack down on the criminal activities in abducting and trafficking in women and children .  
On cross-strait relations , he attempted to avoid one China , which is " fundamental " and adopted some soft means to strive to create some " obscure and blurred space , " so as to resist the appeal of the mainland motherland for developing cross-strait relations and starting political negotiations under the principle of one China .  
The side of the mainland motherland has also repeatedly expressed welcoming the visits of all the political parties , organizations , and personages from all circles in Taiwan , so as to exchange views and enhance common understanding on jointly opposing " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait relations , and pushing forward the progress of peaceful reunification .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
Family planning associations at the grass-roots level should take an active part in exercising democratic management and supervision over family planning and making family planning matters in the villages known to the public , and advance grass-roots democracy , legal institutions , and spiritual civilization , so as to promote social and economic development and political stability .  
In order to further strengthen Sino-African friendly cooperative ties , the Chinese Government has proposed the convocation of " Sino-African Cooperation Forum - - Beijing 2000 Ministerial Conference " in October this year , to jointly discuss with African nations such issues as how to push forward the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order and how to further strengthen Sino-African economic cooperation and trade in the 21st century .  
Relations of cooperation between the two countries have been constantly reinforced in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural fields ; there have been constant high-level contacts between the two armies ; and exchanges are being carried out in multiple fields and at multiple levels .  
The " five noes policy " is not some new olive branch extended by the new Taiwanese leaders , it is not their political bargaining chip , because as a minority leader , and with the DPP not the majority organization in the island 's public opinion , the points rejected in the " five noes " have strong support among those opposing " independence " in the opposition parties , which exercises a natural restraining action on the DPP . It is not something that any leader or the DPP can easily promote at will .  
Naturally , the speech also used words like " government for all the people , " " rule by the clean and upright , " following by promising to " seek the new , " " seek change , " " oppose ' black gold ' politics " which follow the mainstream of public opinion on the island .  Chen promised to fight for the support of all political factions and to balance the ruffled feelings of the 60 percent of the electorate which did not support him in the election .  
The " political power machine " which the KMT built while it was ruling the mainland was not completely destroyed during the KMT-CPC civil war , and after arriving in Taiwan it was concentrated , mended , and reformed into what is now this deformed " political power machine " which is " a province but not a province , not a state but claiming to be a state , and neither fish nor fowl . "  After taking up power , Chen Shui-bian can hardly resolve this problem for the time being .  
The anti-China activities of " Taiwan independence thinkers " were coordinated with those of western anti-China political forces and human rights organizations , with east and west singing in tune ; they groundlessly labelled the mainland of the motherland as " opposed to democracy and human rights " ; for instance they frequently applied their self-flaunted " democracy and human rights " to abuse the CPC 's opposition to " Taiwan independence " as oppressing Taiwan with " nationalism " and " great Han chauvinism . "  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Although the international situation has seen profound changes , China will continue to unswervingly pursue the independent and peaceful foreign policy , develop friendly cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and make joint efforts with other countries to build a just and rational new international political and economic order .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
It is necessary to firmly establish a correct outlook on education and qualified personnel , positively promote educational reform and development , take great pains to improve ideological and political education , moral education , education on discipline , and education on legal system , pay attention to the cultivation of enterprising spirit and practical ability , and seriously do a good job of lightening the excessively heavy homework assignments for the students of elementary and middle schools , so as to better promote children 's all-round development .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Although profound changes have taken place in the international situation , China will continue to firmly adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , develop friendship and cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence , and work jointly to build a new , fair , and reasonable international political and economic order .  
Li Peng , member of the Standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , stressed at the forum : In developing the western regions , we must properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; ensure a benign cycle for resources exploitation and ecological protection ; and leave our future generations with space for sustainable development .  
Patriotic scientists dedicated to the service of their country were unable to realize their goals .  Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , all the people of China went through an arduous struggle and won national independence and people 's liberation by the middle of the 20th century .  The new China was established , creating the basic political conditions for the flourishing development of China 's science and technology and other such undertakings .  
China 's political stability and economic development provide a solid , substantive technological foundation with the complete conditions and capability to catch up with the advanced tide of global science and technology .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is willing to establish friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world , including Yugoslavia , on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and to make joint efforts for the establishment of a new , peaceful , stable , just , and rational political order so that mankind will have a better tomorrow .  
As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
To this end we need to make unremitting exploration and constantly sum up experience .  As far as legislation is concerned , we will continue to uphold the principle of proceeding from China 's national conditions , safeguard consistency in the legal system based on the constitution , persist in the integration of legislation with major decisions concerning reform and development , ensure by the means of system and legislation the implementation of the state 's major political line , expedite socialist modernization , thus ensure the country 's prosperity and perpetual political stability .  
Many papers and periodicals are geared to the masses , the grass roots , and daily life , and persist in guiding people with correct public opinion ; the readers have welcomed them , and they have played a positive role in satisfying the political , economic , cultural , and daily life requirements of the masses and spurring the building of the two civilizations .  
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
Taiwan 's industrial and commercial circle , political sphere , scholars , and media were all disappointed , and even foreign businessmen also indicated their dissatisfaction .  Taiwan 's stock market continued to fall for straight five days .  The general index fell from 9,119 points on 19 May to 8430 points on 25 May , a fall of almost 700 points .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
This research fellow of the State Council 's Development Studies Center said that the main obstacle to foreign enterprises operating in China arises from problems in the domestic setup ; in 1997 the Chinese Government set " building a state with legal system " as the basic goal in the reform of China 's political setup , and we should now make practical efforts to achieve this .  
As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
He encouraged them to work hard and have a profound understanding of China 's independent foreign policy of peace .  He urged them to make active efforts to carry out their work .  He also urged them to introduce China 's situation to personages of political as well as other sectors in Slovenia so as to increase their understanding about China .  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago , China and Slovakia have made joint efforts to promote the constant development of friendly cooperation in the political , economic , military , science , technology , and cultural fields .  
In his " inaugural speech , " in order to leave a good impression , the new Taiwan leader used ambiguous and beautiful words to describe his viewpoints on the history , the nation , the state , and sovereignty .  His speech , extremely pitiable and ridiculous , yielded political results by comprehensively reflecting the shadow of the " two-state theory " and the soul of " independent Taiwan . "  
However , through the sudden change in the world history , the Taiwan authorities only caught sight of splittism and the " strategically favorable chance " of " creating another China . " As a result , the dregs under the Taiwan Strait were floating and the evil wind was blowing over the strait , thus turning the destiny of one China into a political magic and turning the ever-improving cross-strait relations since 1992 into ones " without agreements . "  
Correctly understanding their distinctive mentalities and behaviors is the basis for setting the goals , assignments , and requirements and developing the methods for ideological and political construction .  It is also the premise for making ideological and political work more relevant , systematic , and creative .  
Wen Jiabao called for the governments at all levels and pertinent departments in the disaster areas to firmly bear in mind the party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly , deepen their understanding of the anti-drought work from the high plane of stressing political awareness , be eager to meet the needs of the masses , think about what the masses are thinking about , and do a good job of providing relief to the disaster areas with warmth and enthusiasm in a solid manner .  
Third , we must work hard to build up a contingent of high-quality community workers ; and while giving full play to the role of existing committee cadres , we should also adopt effective measures to promptly replenish the contingent of community cadres .  Particularly , we should promote to the leading posts of communities a number of outstanding young cadres who have sound political qualities , a fairly high educational level , and a relatively strong work ability and who love the community work , so as to enhance the vigor and vitality of community leading bodies .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
The PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] General Political Department the other day issued a circular demanding that the party committees and political organs at all levels further unify ideological understanding ; strengthen organization and leadership ; earnestly guide in an all-round way the positive education on " three stresses " with Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " ; and see to it that the education will yield tangible results .  
Both sides stand for world multipolarization .  They stressed the necessity [ English version uses " need " ] to establish an equitable , just , fair and reasonable new international political and economic order that is free of hegemonism and power politics and is based on equality .  They indicated their readiness to work together for the establishment of such a new order .  
The two sides held that an earlier solution to the Afghanistan issue was in the interest of regional security and stability and stressed the need to seek a political settlement through negotiation between the parties concerned and establish a broad - based government representing all factions and ethnic groups . 
In the meantime , the two sides maintained that to look at the political , economic , social , cultural and civil rights , particularly the right to development in a comprehensive [ English version uses " balanced " ] manner and in the right perspective is of special significance to all countries .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
He stressed that since reform and opening up which started more than 20 years ago , relatively great achievements have been scored by China in various economic and social undertakings .  At present , China 's economic structural reform and political structural reform are being simultaneously carried out and continuously deepened .  Governing the country according to laws and building China into a country with socialist legal system have been written in the constitution as the general plan for the administration of the country .  
He emphasized that in the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , China 's economic and social undertakings have made good progress .  China 's restructuring of the economic system and political reform are being implemented at the same time and are continuously being deepened .  China has made governing the country according to law and constructing a socialist lawful country its general plan of government and has written that into its Constitution .  
Li Chongfu believes that " always be " and " faithful representative " mean that the party 's line , principles and policies and its overall political guidance formulated and implemented during any time must be adapted to the situation of that time and to local conditions , and they must reflect the law and requirements of the development of productive forces , reflect the wish of the working masses , and be able to promote the development of productive forces and the social progress .  
Originally , it was believed that the Senate would pass the bill without problem .  However , all of a sudden , halfway , out rushed a " Cheng Yaojin [ a character in a Chinese story ] , " who claimed that the Senate would not act as " rubber stamp " and demanded that some bills with strong colors of the US bipartisan political struggle , such as the bill on fiscal appropriations , and so on , be deliberated and examined together with the bill on granting the PNTR status to China .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
Viewed from another angle , if you do n't want to appraise in a most constructive , diversified and flexible way the reality that a political party and its leaders voluntarily proposed the policy of allowing a country to have two social and political systems and even two armies with their own commanders and that this policy won popular support , at least , you should believe that this country and its people have sufficient wisdom and ability to handle major issues of the state .  
He stressed : Over the 20-plus years of reform and opening up , the Chinese economy and various social undertakings have made great strides .  At present , the reforms of China 's economic and political structures are going synchronously and getting deeper and deeper .  We take the rule of law and the building of a socialist legal system as the blueprint for governing our country and have written it into the Constitution .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
through the struggle during the period of reform , our party did away with the shortcomings of the economic , political , science , educational , cultural , and other systems that were unable to meet demand of further development of productive forces , thus further liberating and developing productive forces .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
However , since the international community has failed to launch a forceful crackdown on organized international criminal gangs owing to the loopholes in the laws of certain countries , such as " political asylum " and " respect for human rights , " the activities of illegal migration have been revived like dying cinders glowing again and have persisted despite repeated prohibitions , thus doing tremendous harm to the society .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
Under the present new international and domestic situations , further doing a good job of cultivating and selecting minority cadres is of still greater importance to implementing the guidelines of the 15th national party congress and the central nationality work meeting , putting into effect Comrade Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " smashing the Western hostile forces ' political conspiracy of " Westernizing " and " dividing " China , accelerating the implementation of the large-scale western development , and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
When handling cases and problems , political and law organs are urged to enhance consciousness in the comprehensive management of public order , and while cracking down on law-breaking and on criminal activities , to consider problems from the angle of crime prevention , to search for reasons for criminal activity and to discover loopholes in the law through the handling of cases , to put forward preventive measures , to help relevant departments improve management system , strengthen education on the legal system , and implement preventive measures .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
To enhance understanding and increase consensus , the foreign ministries of the two countries set up a multilevel and multiform political consultation system , under which the two foreign ministers exchange visits and meet at the UN General Assembly and foreign ministry officials hold regular consultations .  
Chen Shui-bian calls the mainland 's struggle against " Taiwan independence " hegemonism , and has confused state sovereignty with human rights .  He has attempted to sow dissension among the compatriots in Taiwan , the international community , and the mainland , and publicly promoted official relations between Taiwan and the United States , in addition to meddling with the social and political affairs of the mainland .  
Meanwhile , along with the elimination of the feudal serf system , the cultural trait accompanying the old system that the Tibetan culture was monopolized by a tiny minority of serf owners will surely be " exterminated " ; and the old cultural autocracy featured by both an unification of the administration and the monastery and the dominance of region in Tibet 's entire social and political life will surely be eliminated .  This is a necessity in the development of the Tibetan history , and also a necessity in the development of the Tibetan culture .  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
While inheriting fine traditions , the ideological and political work in the new period has expanded unceasingly in the light of new developments and characteristics and gradually developed a complete set of policies and principles which can be summarized into adherence to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide ; 
The questions of how we should approach the current international and domestic situations , how we should approach the various problems cropping up in China 's reform and opening up especially in the course of building a socialist market economy , and how we should face the difficulties and challenges facing our economic and social lives all have to do with the political conviction of party-member cadres and all the more with the confidence and morale of the broad masses of the people .  It will not do not to face and not to look at them squarely .  
It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
A great era , magnificent goals , and arduous tasks set demands on us to firmly grasp the central link of the ideological education work .  All are urged to make this central ideological and political work conference a new starting point and a fresh motive force , and to do even better , down-to-earth , and effective ideological and political work .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
The circular urged that all units should treat the process of studying and carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a process of strengthening and improving the army 's ideological and political work .  Guided by the speech , they should further deepen the guiding spirit of the political work for the whole army .  We must make efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological-political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
Under conditions in which party work has been a part-time job In the past few years , we have done ideological and political work and engage in production and business operation at the same time and carried out varied and colorful enterprise-cultural activities ; by so doing , we have created a favorable environment full of healthy trends and encouraging people to make progress ; this has increased the cohesion of the enterprise and made the road of party building and ideological and political work broader and broader .  
Since its establishment , the enterprise 's economic efficiency and social effects have developed fast , to which the contribution of the highly effective ideological and political work can not be left unrecognized .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  They should further enhance the inspiring force , rally force , and fighting capacity of the ideological and political work .  
The two countries have maintained close political contacts and consultations , and have brought about a constant growth to their economic relations and trade ; what is more , our two countries have reached agreements on a number of major cooperative projects during a recent period , and this will surely produce a far-reaching influence on the bilateral relations between the two countries .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
Wang Zhaoguo pointed out that the united front has always paid attention to ideological and political work , especially since the Party 's 14th National Congress . With Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the Party 's Central Committee and with the ideological and political work of the united front as the key link in rallying and mobilizing people of all realms and all nationalities to bring about the responsibilities of the Party and country , it has effectively mobilized people of all realms to take part in modernization construction and enthusiasm for the glorious national rejuvenation .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
This requires us to have an insight into the general international situation and a profound understanding of China 's conditions .  It requires us to put forward a correct political line and formulate feasible principles and policies based on a clearly defined historical mission .  
During these 10 years , he bore all types of false charges that had no basis , was subjected to unprecedented humiliation , experienced a lifetime 's most difficult " coming out of retirement , " and faced the most chaotic and irrational political situation .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .  
The thinking of a " decisive battle offshore " and any overconfident military and political provocations are no doubt nonsensical and crazy practices and a risk that invites self-destruction .  Some people in Taiwan should rein in on the brink of the precipice .  
The pictorial , in vivid visual form and simple language , provides graphic and rich materials for party members to fully understand and grasp the essence of the " three represents " theory .  It is a teaching aid for grass-roots party organizations to step up and improve party ideological and political work .  
The party committees and political organs at all levels of the army and armed police held during their study that , guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory , Chairman Jiang 's important speech has comprehensively analyzed the international and domestic situation and the tasks facing ideological and political work , profoundly explained the important role of ideological and political work in the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and specifically proposed the guidelines and principles for further strengthening and improving ideological and political work .  
During their studies the officers and men of the army and the armed police pointed out that ours is a people 's army under the party 's absolute leadership , and strong and effective ideological and political work is the political strong point in our development and growth and our cherished magic weapon for defeating the enemy .  We must unswervingly assign ideological and political work the primary position in all work .  
President Jiang Zemin delivered a written speech at the airport .  He said mankind is looking forward to the dawn of the 21st century , adding that people hope this century will be a century of peace and development , for the establishment of a new , just and rational international political and economic order in this century , and for brilliant human civilization in this century .  
11 .  The two sides emphasize the importance of exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern .  They are willing to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation and work to build a just and rational international political and economic new order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
It became the first book which introduced China to the West . On 6 November 1970 , China and Italy formally established diplomatic ties , thereby opening up a new chapter of friendship and cooperation .  Both countries have made comprehensive progress in facilitating political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological cooperation .  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
Chen Zhili stressed : While fully affirming our achievements , we must soberly notice that there are still quite pronounced problems facing party building and ideological and political work in colleges and universities and that we are faced with a more complicated situation , heavier tasks , and more arduous work ahead .  
In view of this and in consideration of the current regional and surrounding geopolitical circumstances , all sides have determined to deepen cooperation in the political , diplomatic , economic and trade , military , military technological , and other fields to consolidate regional peace and stability .  
6 .  All sides indicate they will resolutely uphold the purpose and principles of the UN Charter ; restate the legitimate rights of all countries to choose their own paths of political , economic , and social development according to their national conditions ; oppose intervention in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretexts of " humanitarianism " and " protecting human rights ; " and support the efforts of one another in safeguarding the five countries ' national independence , sovereignty , territorial integrity , and social stability .  
From Shanghai , Moscow , Alma-Ata , Bishkek to Dushanbe , the degree of military confidence among the five countries along their borders has constantly risen , border problems left over by history have been settled gradually , cooperation in the area of political security has been constantly deepened , consensus over regional and international matters has been constantly expanded , and economic and trade cooperation has developed day by day .  
11 .  Both sides emphasized that exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern is of great significance , and are willing to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation and to make efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the UN Charter as well as established principles of international laws .  
Over the past eight-odd years since China and Turkmenistan established diplomatic ties , both countries have gradually expanded mutually-beneficial political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational cooperation , and attained good results in this regard .  
As far as the domestic situations in these newly independent countries are concerned , generally speaking they are still in the transitional period of system restructuring and have a lot of economic and political issues to be resolved .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
intensified the support of the treasury for the development of the social security system ; continued to increase the input into agriculture , forestry , and water resources management , as well as the protection of the ecological environment ; comprehensively implemented the decision taken by the CPC Central Committee to stop armed forces , the armed police force , and political and judicial organs from engaging in business activities ;  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech shows great foresight , has the overall situation in view , contains rich and profound ideas , possesses the distinct features of the times , and aims at very definite objectives , which is of momentous practical significance as well as far-reaching historical significance to intensifying and improving the party 's ideological and political work oriented to the new century .  We must study the gist of the speech and put it into practice in a conscientious manner .  
However , we should fully understand the importance , protracted nature , and arduousness of intensifying the building of spiritual civilization , firmly foster the political awareness and the awareness on general interest , responsibility , ideological front , and innovation , and further increase the sense of mission , urgency , and the age , so as to carry out the building of spiritual civilization in a still more vivid , enlivened , and solid way .  
Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .  However , the quality of judges and procurators should not be reflected in their academic qualifications alone .  Examination only reveals professional standards , whereas other factors , such as political integrity and vocational ethics , can only be assessed by practical work .  
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
Regrettably , out of political considerations , a number of developed country shareholders willfully trampled on the World Bank charter , imposed conditions on the relevant recommendation report prepared by the World Bank administrative authorities , and raised unreasonable demands in another attempt to obstruct the project 's implementation .  
By grasping the " new reality , " " new problems , " " new demands , " and " new development " in accordance with the demands of the four " close connections , " and carrying out active explorations , we can carry out ideological and political work in a still more vivid and dramatic and effective way .  
The fundamental switch from planned to socialist market economy has brought about tremendous changes in China 's social life and has also set new challenges and demands on ideological and political work .  
To achieve practical results in ideological and political work , it is necessary to closely combine it with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , and concentrate efforts on masking an issue of " new development " ; we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , ways , means , and mechanisms , and continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
By grasping the four " new " things , upholding the four " close connections , " and carrying out work in a creative way , ideological and political work will be closer to the era , the masses , and daily life , will be effectively intensified and improved , and will also be able to give fuller play to its role as spiritual motive force and political guarantee .  
In this way , the Taiwan side can achieve its goal of substituting the fake for the genuine .  When Li Denghui [ Lee Teng-hui ] was in power , the Taiwan authorities played all kinds of tricks .  The Taiwan authorities interpreted the statement as " two equal political entities , " " one China , one Taiwan , " and " one China in future tense " before dishing out their " two states theory . "  
Zhu Rongji made clear to the countries visited that China holds an active attitude of developing bilateral ties , and emphasized China 's willingness to strengthen political dialogue and consultations with these countries on the basis of mutual respect , reciprocity based on equality , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
The speech has been made , the goal has been set , the road has been clearly pointed out , and the key lies in the whole party getting to work to vigorously grasp implementation and carry out ideological and political work in a more extensive , deep-going , vivid and dramatic , and effective way .  
The party 's ideological and political work must be continually strengthened and improved in light of the continually changing reality in the new historical period , and can not be relaxed or weakened in the slightest .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Fourth , in close connection with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , methods , means , and mechanisms to continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
We must lay stress on forms and methods in ideological and political work , and strive to make it vivid and lively and attractive to the eye and ear ; it should soak into the depths of the heart like life-giving spring breeze and rain , and exert imperceptible influence like a silent lubricant .  
Igor Rogachev said : " The development of strategic cooperative partnership with China is a fundamental principle in Russia 's foreign policy .  The principle can not be altered and has won support from major social and political power in Russia . "  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
Reportedly , Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will have a separate meeting with his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian tomorrow afternoon.An authoritative figure here disclosed that the political topic of Putin 's visit to China would mainly involve international strategic security , anti-missile , and regional hot issues .  In addition , Putin 's visit to China is regarded as informing the Chinese side of Russia 's position at the G-8 Summit and relevant matters .  
The correct way to adapt oneself to the new challenges in international security , safeguard world peace , and protect the legitimate security interests of different countries is not to undermine the " ABM Treaty " but to push forward the establishment of a new , just , and rational international political order , abandon power politics and the arbitrary use of force in international affairs , and further strengthen regional and international security .  
Zhu Bangzao said , there is another important content of this statement , that is , non-strategic ABM defensive systems that are not banned under the ABM treaty , and international cooperation in this field , should not damage the security of other countries , should not lead to the establishment and strengthening of closed military and political blocs , and should not damage global and regional stability and security .  
Leaders of the two countries extensively and profoundly exchanged their views on strengthening political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational , and local cooperation between the two countries , as well as bilateral and international issues of mutual concern , including the question of anti-ballistic missiles .  
The participants unanimously held that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech was a brilliant exposition and very rich in content .  It was strongly political and theoretical in nature and it stressed the important position of theoretical work .  It put forward the tasks and demands on theoretical work , and explained a series of major theoretical and practical fundamental issues that concern the overall situation .  
The DPRK and Russia acknowledged that every country has the right to decide its own road to political , economic , and social development .  They opposed interference in other countries ' internal affairs under the pretext of " humanitarianism " and supported each other in their efforts to safeguard their own independence , sovereignty , and territorial integrity .  
Yu Yongbo said emphatically : The important speech given by Chairman Jiang at the central ideological and political work conference profoundly expounded on a host of major issues in strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation .  A policy document of great theoretical and guiding significance , the speech further pointed the way for us to cope with the overall situation of party and government work and to do a good job in ideological and political work in the military .  
At that forum , which was presided over by Nanjing MR Commander Liang Guanglie , Fang Zuqi also reminded the responsible persons from the upper echelons of the party committees in the Nanjing MR to " strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the army " and " make great efforts to provide a powerful mental motive force for winning a war " in the process of making preparations for military struggle .  
In the face of a complicated and changing post-Cold War international situation , the two countries share broad consensus in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries , and in building a new international political and economic order that is just and rational . 
It is necessary to build a contingent of ideological and political workers who are politically strong , professionally competent , highly disciplinary , and upright , according to the requirements of improving quality , optimizing the structure , and integrating full-time workers with part-time workers .  
Particularly in the extraordinary 20th century , the unyielding and hard-working Asian people have written another grand epic of political awakening and economic takeoff through their unremitting efforts for prosperity .  They have thus strongly promoted the historical progress and social development .  
These principles have been commonly accepted as the norms governing state-to-state relations , and they have played a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the promotion of friendship and cooperation among developing countries .  They have also already played and will continue to play a significant role in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
A new international political and economic order should be based itself upon the universally recognized norms governing international relations , meet the need of the development and progress of our times and reflect the spirit of peace and equality .  It should ensure that all countries , regardless of their size , wealth and strength , are all equal members of the international community .  
He hoped that the two sides would continue maintaining close cooperation ; enhance mutual support in the areas of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ; put forth joint efforts opposing interference from without , promoting the establishment of a just and rational new world political and economic order , and protecting the legitimate rights of developing nations .  
When Hong Kong moved into the final years of the transitional period , the last governor dispatched by the British side dished out a " three violation " political reform scheme , tried hard to foster their political proxy and extend the influence of their colonial rule , and attempted to create disorder and confusion to undermine the comprehensive implementation of the Basic Law in the future SAR .  
Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1992 , relations between the two countries have developed in a sustained and steady manner .  Their cooperation in the political , economic , security , cultural , and other fields also has scored remarkable achievements .  
and ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992 , the two countries have achieved fruitful results in constantly expanding mutual exchange and cooperation in political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and other fields as well as in international affairs .  
established and perfected rules and regulations ; and have satisfactorily resolved many " long-standing , big , and difficult " issues which long defied solution .  Through the education and rectification activity , the vast numbers of cadres in leading organs have enhanced their political awareness and the awareness of responsibility , and have pledged one after another to set an example for the troops with their own conduct in fulfilling the requirement of " three represents . "  
The facts are , since assuming office on 1 July 1997 , Chief Executive Tung has led the SAR government in smoothly and effectively overcoming the assaults of a string of external factors as well as the political , social , economic , and people 's livelihood problems left over from the British Hong Kong Government era to win the central government 's great trust internally and international commendation externally .  
2 .  On the other hand , an unprecedented great mass fervor in visiting the mainland and conducting cross-strait exchanges has arisen among Taiwan 's political parties , nongovernmental organizations , and representatives of popular will .  This is something really worth welcoming and really heartening because the people on both sides are the forces that will ultimately decide the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
Luo Gan said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very much concerned about Xinjiang 's economic development and social and political stability .  The task of maintaining Xinjiang 's social and political stability is arduous so I hope that Xinjiang 's judicial organs , under direct leadership of the regional party committee and government , will further seek consensus , strengthen cooperation , duly focus attention on the drive to improve social order , and carry out other special struggles .  
The " three stresses " education has been conducting at party committees above regiment level and grass-roots party organizations , the cohesive and combat forces of party committees at all levels have been generally strengthened , the ideological and political level of the vast number of party members have been raised to a new plane , troops of the whole army have been conducting mass scientific and technological training activities in a down-to-earth way and their capability for defensive battles under modern conditions has been further intensified ;  
Chi Haotian emphasized that we should unswervingly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army , vigorously strengthen the ideological and political building of troops , earnestly study Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study a series of expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin , resolutely implement President Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents , " continue conducting the " three stresses " education in a profound way , enhance the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , and keep the political color of our army forever .  
They said their current first visit to China as " Troika " foreign ministers fully demonstrates the great importance the Rio Group attaches to developing its relations with China . They hoped the visit would not only promote cooperation between the Rio Group and China in political , economic and trade , and social fields , but also increase the possibility of their cooperation in scientific and technological and information fields , so that their relationship will develop in width and depth .  
contribute to help maintaining world peace and promoting common development ; and while stressing political dialogue , enhance bilateral exchanges and cooperation in economic , trade , financial , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational areas , so that the dialogue mechanism becomes a major channel in pushing forward mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Latin America .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .  
Seventy years ago , facing the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries , Mr . Deng Yanda established the Interim Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang , the predecessor of the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party , and explicitly set forth the political program of overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek regime by means of armed force and establishing a political power of common people with peasants and workers as the main body .  After Mr .  
In the new historical period , the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party firmly supports the line , principles , and policies adopted by the CPC since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , conscientiously performs its functions as a political party participating in the government , and does effective work for promoting national economic and cultural development , safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity , and promoting the great cause of the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
Many in the political circles , public opinion , and even the " vice president " Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] , all hold a reserved attitude toward Chen Shui-bian 's trip .  They believe that Chen Shui-bian 's trip does not conform to what is appropriate for the present time , is full of variables , and that it will be difficult to gain any positive results .  As well , they think it is bound to have a negative impact on the already turbid cross-strait relations .  
Many comrades have even given their precious lives !  However , when measured by the standard of the requirement of the " three represents , " our police contingent still lags far behind in terms of its political , ideological , and professional quality , as well as in its discipline and work style .  
On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
Luo Gan stressed : We should persistently arm the mind of the vast numbers of public security officers with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the gist of a series of important speeches made by Comrade Jiang Zemin ; constantly enhance their consciousness and firmness in implementing the party 's basic line ; and see to it that the police contingent can always retain its political color of being loyal to the party , to the motherland , to the people , and to the law .  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
So long as we seize the opportune time to implement the spirit of the central ideological and political work conference , seriously sum up our successful experience of the preceding stage , and earnestly overcome the weak links in our work , we will certainly be able raise the " double thinking " educational activities to a higher level .  
Qiu Xueqiang , director of the Political Department of the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , said : In conducting the " three kinds of education , " we should focus our attention on improving the quality of the procurators ' ranks as a whole , especially their ideological and political quality , so that they will become a force that is united with revolutionary ideals and conviction , that will unswervingly subordinate itself to the interests of the whole , and that is brave in fighting and will not worry the party re any degeneration .  
The Pachang River incident has produced an unprecedented impact on Taiwan 's politics .  The administrative ability of the new government has all the more been called into question , and the political situation on the island is not stable .  Most public opinion thinks this is a very inappropriate time for the leader of the Taiwan authorities to visit abroad .  
On the other hand , we must see that the factors constraining the economic rebound , such as insufficient effective social demand , conspicuous structural contradictions in the economy , continued " obstructions " to developing the consumer goods market , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes , remain very prominent , and we must maintain effective political direction and support to provide correct guidance for the economic momentum .  
Carrying out comprehensive institutional reform is a strategic task set by the 15th CPC Congress , is urgently required by the establishment of a socialist market economic system , and is an important part of political system reform .  
The forum seriously studied and implemented the spirit of the important speech delivered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the Central Ideological and Political Work Conference , discussed how to enhance the convincing and combat effectiveness of theoretical work , how to make ideological and political work more specific and effective , and how to make propaganda , ideological work , and spiritual civilization better serve the development of the west region .  
It is reported that Lee Yuan-tseh has lately been pondering deeply over cross-strait topics .  He understands that it will not be easy to synthesize differing views into a concrete conclusion , given the resistance from the major political parties and the wide political spectrum from which the task force 's members come .  However , he is still hopeful that the cross-party task force will present a set of recommendations that will get the two organizations across the Taiwan Strait to resume negotiations within the institutional framework .  
As officials responsible for " security of their own area , " the party committees and government at all levels should frequently concern themselves with the progress of the investigation and handling of the contradictions and disputes .  Regarding the major contradictions and outstanding problems that might affect social stability , they should personally get involved , go deep into the realities of life , do well meticulous ideological and political work , seriously mitigate the contradictions , and resolve the problems .  
As officials directly responsible for maintaining social stability , the leading comrades responsible for political and legal work and for comprehensive management of social order should vigorously organize and coordinate with all the departments concerned , share the work with individual responsibility , pool efforts , create a situation of everyone getting involved in the work , and promote the investigation and handling of contradictions and disputes .  
The principal leaders of the party committees and the governments at various levels , as the number one responsible person for " ensuring local peace and stability , " should constantly be concerned about the situation of the contradiction and dispute investigation and mediation work , personally take a hand in handling any major contradictions and conspicuous problems that affect local social stability , go deep into the realities of life , do a thorough and meticulous ideological and political work , and seriously resolve contradictions and problems .  
Cooperation and exchanges in the political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , and public health spheres have continued to expand with great results .  And the close cooperation in international and regional affairs has been strengthened with each passing day .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
While paying attention to the pattern of modern education , the " Opinions " have also made use of the PLA 's political superiority .  The " Opinions " have summarized and incorporated the PLA 's basic experiences of strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances .  The " Opinions " are currently , and will be for some time in the future , an important guiding document for strengthening ideological and political education in military academies .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
For more than 20 years of reform and opening up , especially since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the reform of the personnel system relating to cadres , under the leadership of the party Central Committee , has developed and deepened step by step with the progress of the reform of the economic and political systems , scoring tremendous achievements .  This has provided a systematic guarantee for training a contingent of cadres who can fit in with the needs of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
Since the securities commission and its affiliated organizations practiced the vertical management , party committees at all levels have done a lot of work in intensifying the party building and ideological and political work .  However , compared with the duties and missions shouldered by the securities regulatory departments and with the requirements of the party central committee and the State Council , it is still not enough .  
Yan Haiwang said : The intensification of ideological and political work must serve the party 's central work , and the achievements obtained by the securities sector in the ideological and political work must be embodied in the intensified supervision and control , the ensured healthy operation of the securities market , and the accelerated economic reform and development .  
Yan Haiwang stressed that to intensify the ideological and political work , it is imperative to strengthen the leadership , so the leading bodies at all levels must persist in " stressing theoretical study , stressing political awareness , and stressing ethical conduct , " place the ideological and political work in an important position , establish and amplify the ideological and political work responsibility system , make regular study , step up examination , and earnestly " do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both . "

A government worker from Taichung named Chen Meijin , and a Kaohsiung businessman named Chen Yuqi , both believe that " money diplomacy " will not bring Taiwan any visible benefits , and that the Taiwan authorities should devote themselves to wiping out black gold [ political corruption ] , enhancing social benefits , and improving public security .  These are the problems that the public is really concerned about .  
In particular , in the contemporary world , from nature to human society , from the economic and political realms to culture and science , things are developing and changing at a speed unimaginable to people in the previous periods .  
The opposition parties have been continuously bombarding the National Reunification Council , and the outlook for the " Chen-Lien Meeting " has changed .  Subsequently the roundtable of political parties may be in the dilemma of breaking up .  Moreover , discontent within the DPP as the minority ruling party is continuing to brew , with the grudge directed at the financial and economic cabinet members .  
We must treat thorough strengthening of Party building and ideological and political work , upholding Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide , upholding implementation of consciousness of the Party 's basic line and educational policy , upholding the socialist direction for running a school , strengthening the ideological front , and providing reliable political guarantees and organizational assurances in order to promote reform and development of schools and nurturing of successors for building socialism as the outstanding substance and requirements of " three stresses " education for higher educational institutions .  
Over the past dozen years or so , Zhang Ping , who began to write in 1981 , has written such anticorruption masterpieces as " The Sky Dragnet , " " The Law Has Shaken Western Shanxi , " and " Ambush from All Sides . " He did that by displaying ample political enthusiasm and a high sense of social obligations , as well as by withstanding numerous pressures and breaking through many barriers .  He has been known as " a writer who sings the march of fighting corruption and encouraging honesty . "  
In addition to striving to stabilize the political situation , plan economic reform , pacify Chechnya , reorganize the armed forces , and declare war on the increasingly influential financial oligarchs and local warlords , he has also been actively and steadily readjusting Russia 's foreign policy and intensely pursuing a pragmatic diplomacy .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
Confronted with the new situation marked by increasingly frequent updating and upgrade of naval weapon systems and equipment and their constantly rising technological level , the academy has given full play to the leading and service-ensuring roles of the ideological and political work in meeting the requirements of this new situation .  
We should care about the old people 's ideology , actively explore new formats and new ways of doing ideological and political work under the new situation , and broadly launch healthy and beneficial cultural and sports activities , so that the masses of old people can enjoy their late years and live a healthy , scientific , and civilized lifestyle .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Both the international situation and the domestic situation are changing very rapidly and drastically , and our tasks are very arduous and complex .  To do a good job in reform and development and in ensuring stability , the leading cadres must possess a Marxist political sensitivity , know how to discover problems from a high political vantage point and solve them , and adhere to principle , take a systematic approach , and enhance their foresight and creativity in work .  
A major task to expedite the development of minority nationality areas is to vigorously train minority nationality cadres of various levels , improve their political and cultural expertise , enable them to guide the economic development of minority nationality areas , and educate and guide , through these cadres , the masses of minority nationalities to change their ideas and to concentrate on developing production , improving living condition , casting off poverty , and becoming rich .  
We sincerely hope that all relevant factions in Burundi will value the peace and stability of the country and the fundamental interests of the people above everything else , completely abandon the tribal and ethnic feud based on the spirit of national reconciliation , and resolve the existing differences by continuing to engage in dialogue and negotiations , so as to finally bring about lasting peace and political stability and economic development of the country .  
According to the current conditions in ideological and political work in the state security organs , Xu Yongyue put forward eight measures for reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , strengthening ideal and belief education , building and managing the cadre contingent , and consolidating leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations .  
The state security organs should continue to carry forward its fine tradition in doing ideological and political work , provide strong and effective political guarantees for the state security work under the new situation , successfully fulfill all tasks assigned by the party central leadership , and triumphantly advance the cause of state security into the 21st century .  
This demands that the leadership groups and leading cadres of these institutes possess a high degree of political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on questions of political orientation and fundamental principles ; they must conduct education and put things right with regard to erroneous ideology and political viewpoints that run counter to regarding economic construction as the central task , to reform and opening up , and to the four cardinal principles ;  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
The rapid progress of science and technology in the world , especially the development of information technology , has created new and broad prospects for the development of the productive force and the society .  It is creating a profound influence on political , economic , military , science and technology , culture and social fields of various countries .  
The broad masses of national and religious people must fully understand the hypocritical and reactionary nature of the Dalai separatist clique , uphold and carry forward the fine tradition of patriotism , and firmly resist the penetration and sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces from outside the borders .  Cadres and people of all nationalities must extremely cherish and safeguard stability with a high level of political consciousness ; respect and support one another in their work and life ;  
In order to open up a new vista in carrying out ideological and political work , the CPC Central Committee had promulgated the " Several Suggestions of the CPC Central Committee on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and Political Work " in September 1999 .  The institutions of higher learning in Shanghai put forward their views on carrying out ideological and political work on the computer network and in academic organizations and societies and in classrooms .  This is aimed at occupying all educational fields and creating a fine environment for the healthy growth of young students .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
Leading bodies and leading cadres in colleges and universities have universally received education in basic Marxist tenets , party spirit , and party conduct and tempering in relatively strict inner-party political life and thus achieved new improvement in their ideological and political quality .  
Only when great importance is attached to ideological and political work ; the quality of students is improved comprehensively ; and qualified people are turned out can firm ideals and conviction as well as a firm orientation of running a school be embodied .  
In its effort to strengthen leading body construction and ideological and political work and build itself into a domestically first-class and internationally renown university , Beijing Institute of Technology conscientiously worked out numerous rules and regulations and adopted a lot of effective and practical measures .  After its rectification and reform plan was made public , the masses responded to it strongly and maintained that leaders of the institute had grasped the crux of the matter and something significant could be achieved in its development .  
We are happy to see that with the joint efforts of both sides , the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries have constantly developed in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Lithuania nine years ago . 
There are three basic principles that must be emphasized in establishing a new peaceful , stable , fair and rational international political and economic order : First , all countries should be equal irrespective of their size .  Second , the right of the peoples of various countries in choosing the road of development according to respective national conditions should be respected .  Third , the sovereignty of all countries should not be violated and under no pretext should the internal affairs of other countries be interfered in .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
As the most representative and most authoritative international organization of sovereign states , the United Nations has played an irreplaceable role in maintaining world peace , promoting common development , and in establishing a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
Since then , the two countries have constantly enhanced their mutual understanding and trust and expanded their cooperation year by year in the political , economic , cultural , educational and scientific and technological fields .  
Given that domestic political factors , especially the attitude of the US Congress , are exerting a growing influence on Sino-US relations , bilateral relations will be faced more stern challenges , and all kinds of unpredictable complications will force the leaders on both sides to keep adjusting their respective stands .  Whoever can come up with more specific policies and measures that can exert pressure on the other side will have the upperhand in this intangible trial of strength .  
and added an enchanting brilliance to the prosperity and development of the global economy .  China 's stable political situation , social security , and an economy that has always maintained a relatively high speed of development , are key to China 's achievements in attracting foreign business investments .  
During his successful visit to the three Baltic countries of Lithuania , Estonia and Latvia , Li Peng expressed his wish to further promote cooperation with the Baltic countries in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific and technological field on the principle of " enhancing understanding , improving trust , promoting friendship and increasing consensus " and to further strengthen friendly relations between China and the Baltic countries on the parliamentary and other levels .  The visit produced important results .  
Through their joint efforts in the nine years since the establishment of diplomatic relations , China and the three Baltic countries have continuously developed friendly and cooperative ties in the political , economic , cultural and other fields and have been able to cooperate positively with one another in international affairs .  
He said , China-EU relations have shown good development momentum in recent years , thanks to the joint efforts of the two sides ; leaders of the two sides often meet , political dialogue and consultation have been fruitful , and cooperation in economic , trade , scientific , technological , and other areas has further expanded .  
He said : The UN millenium summit meeting has closed .  At the meeting , revolving around peace and development - - the two main issues currently facing the world - - leaders of all countries looked forward to the future and discussed extensively and in-depth establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order , strengthening the role of the United Nations , and other important issues ; and , through the declaration of the summit meeting , blueprinted the United Nations ' future endeavors .  
China and Guinea have sympathized with and supported each other in the political field , conducted fruitful , friendly cooperation in the economic sector , closely coordinated with each other in the handling of many important international issues , and been jointly protecting the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries . 
Efforts should be taken to make the warning education a success , for it is a major content of our current efforts to strengthen the ideological and political work and it has a close inherent link with the task of thoroughgoingly conducting the " three-stresses " education .  
The grave corruption issue has greatly damaged the Chinese ruling party and government reputation , adversely affected the smooth progress of reform , opening up , and economic construction , and threatened social and political stability .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .  
The voice of the greater number of developing nations has been a united voice , particularly focusing on suffering from unfair treatment and other issues , and stressing that we must through strong efforts establish a new international political and economic order that is equal , just , and rational .  The " joint declaration " passed by the conference embodies the spirit of seeking common ground and reserving differences , and achieved positive results .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
Under this situation filled with opportunities , competition , and challenges , if our judges fail to pay attention to improving their study and enhancing their level and fail to pay attention to updating their knowledge in order to heighten their political , legal , moral , and professional quality as quickly as possible , they will not be able to meet the requirements for the development of judicial work and will be eliminated in the end .  
Chi Haotian said : Sino-Colombian relations have enjoyed a smooth development since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1980 , and the two sides have increased exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , and cultural fields .  The two armed forces have also further developed their relations on the basis of bilateral ties .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
After the five countries in the region gained independence in the early 1990 ' s , they banned extremist religious and nationalist political bodies and openly cracked down on extremists threatening social stability .  
The people 's courts should constantly maintain and carry forward the superiority of ideological and political work and realistically ensure the implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies in the course of doing adjudication work , so as to forcefully provide judicial guarantees and good legal services for the progress of reform , the maintenance of stability , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .  
While carrying out ideological and political work , the people 's courts at various levels should ceaselessly strengthen education in communist ideals .  Under the conditions for strengthening the market economy , courts should pay attention to cultivating and enhancing judges ' moral quality and lay a solid foundation for the broad masses of cadres and policemen to justly enforce the law and work diligently for the people .  
Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , our Party has led the people in the unwavering promotion of reforms of the economic and political systems , establishing and promoting a socialist market economy system , developing socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics , and liberating and developing the social productive forces to the maximum , raising China 's overall national strength to a new level .  
In the new century , we must have a broad perspective , closely observing the various political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural changes in the world and grasping hard-won opportunities firmly . 
General Secretary Jiang 's important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , from a higher starting point , with a broader vision , and in a deeper sense , has brought to light the profound historical background , complicated social environment , and many other formidable challenges facing ideological and political work , and has raised our understanding of the life-line position of ideological and political work to the new height .  
The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting a few days ago to conscientiously study the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech on the grand western development , stressing that the propaganda , ideological , and cultural fronts should resolutely carry out the strategic arrangements of the central authorities , show concern for the grand development , conduct propaganda on the grand development , give support to the grand development , stress political awareness , concentrate energies on implementation , bring real drive into full play , and do practical things for the grand western development .

In the separation of government functions from enterprise management , for example , problems arising from the running of commercial enterprises by special interest entities were solved when the military , armed police and political and legal organs were ordered in 1998 to disengage themselves from commercial operations .  
Since in history imperialism used Catholicism and Protestantism to serve its national political interests , certain foreign missionaries relied on the unequal treaties to commit all kinds of outrages and caused over 1,500 large and small missionary cases [ jiao an ] , for which many Chinese lost their lives , and a number of Chinese Catholics also became innocent victims ; these historical wounds are still there in the hearts of the Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic Church .  
The army , the armed police , the CPC committees and governments at all levels , and procuratorial , judicial and public security organs , treated the implementation of the policy decision as a serious political task .  They took vigorous and resolute action and worked in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner .  
With a great sense of political responsibility and a great sense of mission , they have taken resolute and vigorous action , worked hard , and conscientiously fulfilled their duties .  They have been meticulous and precise in their work .  They have done a lot of effective work .  
In order to realize their ulterior political motives and ambitions , cults often make use of loopholes in state laws and social administration policies .  Under the cloak of religious cultivation or physical exercise , they set up very strict internal interdictions and taboos and establish among their followers illegal and rigidly stratified organizational structures in an attempt to form " secret kingdoms " based on " religious belief " outside the framework of a legal society .  
The " Falungong " cult organization has also made great efforts to employ the so-called " political elite and senior consultants , " nurture and plant trusted and backbone followers , and racked their brains to infiltrate the party and government organs , especially vital departments , so as to spy out confidential information of the party and the government .  Furthermore , they deployed a second echelon in a planned and organized manner in an attempt to avoid being cracked down on , and to wage long-term confrontation with the party and the government .  
He expressed the hope that the youth of religious circles will carry forward and promote the fine traditions of religious personages of the older generation in loving their country and religion ; unswervingly uphold the principle of independent , autonomous , and self-run churches ; conscientiously resist the political and ideological infiltration of foreign forces through religion ; establish a good image of religious practitioners ; unite the youth of religious circles ; inspire greater enthusiasm for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
China has not yet completed its transition from a planned economy to a market economy and the restructuring of the political system is still in its infancy .  That being the case , the entrepreneurial enthusiasm of large numbers of highly educated people is still stifled in many ways .  If we do not accelerate reform and establish a new system favorable to innovation and entrepreneurship , the magnificent goal of creating a Silicon Valley in China in the next five to ten years will remain in the conceptual stage .  
In a special article , China Times described the coming together and eventual parting of ways between Chen and Tang as " the nuclear explosion of the Chen-Tang system " with devastating results to all sides , saying that it not only put a full-stop to " government of the whole people " but cast unpredictable variables to the already disturbing political situation .  
He emphasized that the people would be faced with " political instability , " " economic collapse , " " mistrust of the international community in Taiwan 's policies " and other situations in the days ahead , and Taiwan would become the kind of place which Confucius described as " not fit to go to or to live in . "  
A group of military commanding talents is in the making , who have had a modern scientific and cultural knowledge and a modern management knowledge and who are capable of using modern weapons and are capable of organizing and commanding combined operations among different arms and services .  A new enhancement has been noticed in both the military and political qualities of the officers and men of the three armed services .  
The development of human society tells us that crime is a factor hindering social stability and progress .  It undermines the normal operation of political structures , the correct implementation of state laws and regulations , disturbs social order , and corrodes people 's moral character and spiritual world .  
At a news conference held for the " China-Africa Cooperation Forum-Ministerial Meeting in Beijing in the Year 2000 , " Ji Peiding said the current meeting has two main topics : One is how to promote the establishment of a just and reasonable international political and economic new order geared to the needs of the 21st century in order to protect the common interests of developing countries , and the second is how to further strengthen cooperation between China and Africa in economic and other tangible fields .  
In line with the aim of " consultation on an equal footing , increasing understanding , expanding consensus , strengthening friendship , and promoting cooperation , " the two sides will jointly discuss major issues , such as how to push for the establishment of a new just and rational , international , political , and economic order geared to the 21st century ; how to safeguard the common interests of developing countries ; and how to further enhance Sino-African trade and economic cooperation .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : The current forum has two major topics : First , facing the 21st century , how we should work to establish a just and reasonable new international political and economic order in order to ensure developing countries ' common interests .  
He expressed his firm belief that establishment of a new type of partnership relations between China and African countries within the framework of South-South cooperation , and , in the principle of equality , mutual benefits , diversification , attaching importance to practical results , and common development , deepening and broadening bilateral cooperation in all fields , will be a positive contribution to the establishment of a new international political and economic order .  
The CCDI standing committee is of the opinion that Comrade Xu Penghang , as a party member and leading cadre , exploited his position to help Kangsai Company with its floatation and supported and took part in his family 's purchase of employee shares to make a huge profit .  His behavior has seriously undermined the clean and honest behavior expected of government officials while performing their functions , caused very bad political damage , and constituted a serious violation of discipline .  
I believe that with the joint efforts of China and Africa , the forum surely will open up new prospects for the Sino-African friendly cooperative relationship , and will have a profound impact on promoting the development of south-south cooperation and on establishing a new just and rational international political and economic order .  
Based on the aims of holding consultations as equals , promoting understanding , expanding consensus , strengthening friendship , and spurring cooperation , they held a thorough exchange of views with their Chinese colleagues and reached extensive consensus with them on the two main topics of how to jointly promote the building of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and how to strengthen economic , trade , and other cooperation between China and Africa in the new situation .  
Despite the changing international environment , the two countries have understood and supported each other since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than 40 years ago .  The two countries have had fruitful cooperation in political , economic , military , and other areas , setting a model for South-South cooperation among developing countries .  
Remarkable changes have been noticed in the ideological thinking , discipline , and work style of the country 's police contingent ; the unifying force and the competitive effectiveness of the contingent have both been enhanced on a constant basis ; and the vast numbers of public security personnel and police officers have stood the test of severe and complicated struggles , and have made outstanding contribution to safeguarding the state security , to ensuring a sound social and political stability , and to maintaining a stable public order .  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
Jimzhong Gyaincain Puncog said with deep feeling that 50 years later , Qamdo is no longer the same as before .  A new Qamdo , where the economy is developing , society is advancing , the political situation is stable , the people of all nationalities are united , and the people live and work in peace and contentment , stands like a giant on Sanjiang Plain .

Li Ruihuan stressed : The CPPCC is an important organization for political consultation , democratic supervision , and participation and deliberation in politics , and should contribute toward the formulation of the " 10th Five-Year Plan . " The CPPCC is widely representative and unique in its position ; it has a pool of qualified personnel , smooth channels , and conditions to forward good opinions and suggestions on major policies for the country .  
Zhu Rongji fully demonstrated his diplomatic wit and personal glamour and won universal acclaim through extensive contacts with Japanese government , parliament , political parties , friendly organizations and business circles , and through " unfortified " dialog with the Japanese public on television .  
ASEM members have carried out fruitful dialog and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational and other spheres , thus promoting understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two continents .  
We should take a lead in socialist spiritual civilization construction .  We should further foster close ties between the military and the government as well as between the military and the people .  We should continuously make new contributions in promoting coordinated economic and social development , in consolidating and developing China 's political stability , and in creating a good situation of social stability .  
According to the current conditions of bilateral relations and the new changes in the regional and international situation , Premier Zhu stressed that both China and Japan should continue to observe the principles specified by the three political documents for guiding Sino-Japanese relations , namely , the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement , the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty , and the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration , persistently preserve the overall situation of good-neighborliness , friendship , and cooperation , and persistently maintain the general orientation of the friendship and cooperative partnership .  
The nuclear convention signed between the DPRK and the United States in Geneva in October 1994 has stipulated clearly that the two countries would realize complete normalization in political and economic relations , and the two countries would establish liaison offices in each other 's capital until a diplomatic relationship at ambassadorial level is built .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .

Since the new leader of Taiwan assumed office , he has never recognized the one-China principle , opposing reunification overtly and pursuing " independence " covertly , totally devoid of sincerity in improving cross-strait relations .  As a result , cross-strait relations continue to remain tense and a political crisis cropped up .  This is an even more serious background and deeper cause for the failure of his cabinet .  
The DPP-led " Executive Yuan " asserted that stabilizing the political situation and getting rid of the economic crisis would be taken as two major tasks to tackle .  But it has not introduced any new measures on improving cross-strait relations - - an issue of common concern to the Taiwan public .  
An analysis of historical experiences and current realities of China and foreign countries throughout history will show that whether or not the nationality issue is handled well is of great importance to national unity , economic development , political stability , and social progress .

Today [ 29 October ] Guo Jinlong , newly appointed secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee , pointed out the need to continue the in-depth implementation of Tibet 's work principle in the new period ; that is , " taking economic construction as the center , focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation , and ensuring Tibet 's rapid economic development , its comprehensive social progress and lasting political stability , and the rising living standard . "  The stability and continuity of the policy should be maintained .  
The article pointed out : Since Taiwan 's " premier " has been changed recently , the political situation of the island has been shaky and unstable .  The stock market has slumped , grumbling by the people is heard everywhere , and voices of condemning the leadership of the Taiwan authorities and the Democratic Progressive Party are lingering on incessantly .  
More than five months have passed since the Democratic Progressive Party [ DPP ] became the ruling party in Taiwan . During this period , Taiwan 's situation has not improved as the general public expected .  On the contrary , there have been continuous political storms , chaos , and contradictions , as well as a growing feeling of insecurity among the public .  
Guo Jinlong , secretary of the Tibet autonomous regional party committee , said : " To properly safeguard Tibet 's stability is a requirement to be fulfilled before Tibet can enhance its own development and progress and is also a political responsibility to be shouldered by Tibet for the central authorities and all the Chinese people .

The leadership collective persists in pooling the united front 's strength and wisdom from all sides for the central task of economic construction , thereby forging a united , stable , invigorating , and active political situation , and spurring the constant advancement of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  The leadership collective upholds and perfects the system of multi-party cooperation led by the CPC and the system of political consultation , thereby promoting socialist democratic political construction and further strengthening the people 's democratic dictatorship and state power .

General Party Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that theoretical building is the basis for Party building , theoretical quality is the soul of the ideological and political quality of leading cadres , and strengthening the study of Marxist theory is still an urgent and important task confronting the whole party which must be pushed forward in a persistent way .  
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .

Their common goals are : Actively explore China 's enormous market , strive hard to bring China into the world economic and international political systems dominated by the West , use the game rules formulated by Western countries , which are led by the United States , to restrain China , maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait , prevent armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait , strengthen ties with regional allies , and step up the efforts to contain and guard against China in the security domain .

These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
In measuring China 's political system and political party system , the fundamental point is to proceed from China 's national conditions and from the actual results of China 's revolution , construction , and reform .  First , we must see whether the system can promote the sustained development of the social productive forces and comprehensive social progress .  
The proposition of these criteria has an important practical bearing on dispelling misunderstanding , unifying our understanding , further upholding and improving the CPC-led multiparty cooperative system and the political consultative system , consciously resisting the influence of the Western-style two-party or multiparty system , and holding firm to a correct political direction .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .

he laid very great stress on the question of how to fight to win a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and demanded that the armed forces have a clear understanding of the new situation , further enhance their awareness of hardship , and step up their training with a high degree of political responsibility and the sense of urgency of seizing the day ; they should also make military training more targeted and narrow the gap between training and actual combat . 
They should devote more efforts to guiding the work , coordinating the efforts of various sectors , and solving in a timely manner the difficulties and problems that may be encountered in the struggle .  All police sectors and departments should put stress on the political work and the interest of the whole , uphold and carry forward the fine tradition of public security organs , coordinate closely , and cooperate wholeheartedly .  
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
They focus on establishing the correct world outlook , life outlook , and concept of value to vigorously improve the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , regard cadres , especially cadres at senior and intermediate levels , as focal points to employ the spirit of rectifying work styles to resolve those outstanding issues in the aspects of party styles , clean and honest administrations , and revolutionary integrity , thus conducting the " four educations " in a vivid and lively manner and a solid and effective manner .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
As a fundamental engineering project of strengthening the ideological and political building of the army during the new era , the " four educations " have answered and resolved a series of fundamental issues about affirming revolutionary ideals and convictions like how to propagate the excellent traditions during the new era , how to lay a solid ideological foundation for establishing oneself and conducting oneself in life , and so on .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
Jia Qinglin stressed that the general requirement for the work of elderly cadres in the Beijing Municipality in a period of time to come should be closely revolving round the overall situation of the capital 's work and focusing on grasping well the political treatment and living treatment for elder cadres to fulfill all policies for elderly cadres , strengthen their ideological and political work , and strive to create excellent conditions for the care , medical treatment , teaching , learning , activities , and entertainment of elder cadres .  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
China 's economic development potentials and its vast potential market , the unique role it plays in Asian affairs , its political influence among the developing countries , its special geopolitical status and future prospects of " great China " [ da zhong hua ] , and the acceleration of its military modernization - - all these factors mean that the US government and public can not but attach greater importance to China 's weight in the future international political pattern and its influence in world affairs .  
Senior leader of Taiwan 's industrial circles and chairman of Taiwan 's giant Formosa Plastics Group Wang Yung-ching recently made frequent harsh criticisms of the mistakes committed by the leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party administration and expressed his deep anxiety toward the current political and economic chaos in Taiwan .

In the past 50 years , Chinese private enterprise went though all kinds of ups and downs as the state political situation changed .  After reform and opening up began , the policies of " helping the state and restricting the private " made it hard for private enterprises for a while .  Private enterprises were described as an economic community growing up in " gray shadows . "  For a long time , it was not finding much of a place in mainstream awareness .  Now , however , the private economy has begun to take off .  
" Related sectors " indicated that Taiwan 's current economic warning signals undoubtedly reflect fundamental problems and , even more so , elements of political unrest .  These elements have had a negative psychological impact that resulted in numerous economic measures failing to immediately achieve their expected results .

It is readily apparent that the new " cross-strait " structure of " eternal peace " and " political union " that the Taiwanese leader calls for is a " security structure " with a guaranteed " independent standing .

The local authorities have made great efforts to thoroughly expose the true features of the Falungong cult and the sinister political schemes of Li Hongzhi , popularize scientific and cultural knowledge as well as legal knowledge , and increase the ability of the masses to recognize and stay immune from the cult .  
Through patient , meticulous and earnest ideological and political work over the past year and more , the overwhelming majority of Falungong followers have come to recognize Li Hongzhi 's true features , left the Falungong of their own accord and returned to their normal work , study and life .  
We must not be faint-hearted and hesitant in dealing with the handful of criminals who , with ulterior political motives , held fast to their anti-government , anti-social and anti-people stand , and organized and instigated deceived Falungong maniacs to openly stir up trouble , disrupt public order , and undermine social stability in their attempt to undermine the cause of socialist modernization .  We must deal a resolute blow to them and punish them severely in accordance with law , and must not leave any openings for future trouble .  
Toward Li Hongzhi and his followers who stayed behind the scene , fled overseas and surrendered to anti-China forces of the west , we must continue to expose and criticize them , expose their sinister political schemes and ugly cult nature to the light of day , create an ambiance of social justice , where they are chased by all like rats scurrying across the street , and thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence and social foundation of the Falungong .  
Such perverse acts have led to Taiwan 's turbulent political situation , sluggish economy , tumbling stock prices , and unstable popular feelings .  As a result , not only is the political deadlock between the two sides of the strait unable to be broken , but some factors of uncertainty keeps on increasing .  
Strengthened and expanded bilateral cooperation and enhanced understanding , together with mutual trust and support , will be conducive to the two countries in playing their important roles in the establishment of a new political and economic order in the world .  
Since the US economy has grown strongly in recent years , its military strength far outstrips anyone else , and it controls international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Bank , many in political and academic circles have become dizzy and declared that the US pursuit of world " unipolarization " is historically inevitable .  
Cohen , a political figure who has published many poetry books , mentioned that he said on the Shanghai Stock Exchange that as the middle class on the Chinese mainland grows , their middle class will do " what every middle class has done throughout history " : it will seek a greater voice in governing , it will suggest new and creative approaches to national challenges , and it will push for peaceful solutions to international disputes and stable commerce with its neighbors .  
The military made numerous fruitful results in ideological and political building , started sci-tech training , steadily promoted logistical reform , markedly improved armaments , and continued to raise the overall combat effectiveness .  
China attaches great importance to strengthening friendly cooperation with Syria in various fields , and is willing to work together with Syria to consolidate the political basis for mutual trust and cooperation , to develop mutually beneficial trade and economic relations , to strengthen coordination and support in international affairs , and to jointly develop long-term , stable , sincere and friendly relations of mutually beneficial cooperation geared to the new century between the two countries .  
Xiang Huaicheng said that compared with other constantly developing regional cooperation organization , especially the European economic and monetary union , differences between Asian countries still exist in terms of history , culture , political system , and the level of economic development , and diversification is an conspicuous problem .  This determines that East Asia cooperation is a long-term arduous task .  It is necessary to choose the way and road for cooperation in light of its own characteristics , and the mode of development of other regional cooperation organizations should not be copied mechanically .  
We , Chinese journalists , will , as usual , work together with our counterparts in all countries of the world to make unswerving efforts for establishing a new international political and economic order of being peaceful , stable , fair , and reasonable and for promoting world peace and development .  
3 .  The faction that thinks it is impossible to maintain the status quo , but readjustment should be made gradually : Japan 's demand to become a political and military big country will become an irresistible trend in Japan 's political arena in the future .  The United States can only pay attention to the regional power structure and the popular will at home , and readjust bilateral relations step by step in accordance with such demand .  
continually and positively play a role at the non-governmental level ; further push forward political , economic , scientific , technological , cultural , education , sports , and personnel exchanges between our two countries and exchanges or cooperation between our local governments in all fields .  The people of our two countries should push in an all-round way friendship between China and Japan onto a new stage .  
As extensive contacts and in-depth discussions have resulted in deeper understanding and mutual trust , China and India have come up with a consensus on a wide range of issues , including bilateral relations , international issues , political , economic , cultural , scientific , or technological exchanges , exchanges between governments or parliaments , exchanges between political parties and peoples , border issues , good-neighborhood , and so on .  
In his address at the meeting , Vice Chairman Cheng Siwei said : On the whole , the current international situation is easing , the trend of world political multi-polarization and economic globalization is continuing to develop , and modern science and technology with information technology and life science as the core is developing by leaps and bounds .  Mankind is facing a rare development opportunity as well as a formidable challenge .  
The Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum was founded in Tokyo in January 1993 .  The purpose of the forum is to provide an opportunity for parliamentarians of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to discuss issues of common concern , and put forward suggestions on international affairs , in order to deepen their understanding of the region 's political , economic , social , and cultural situations .  
The two important documents approved by the meeting , the " Beijing Manifesto " and the " Outline for Sino-African Economic and Social Development , " comprehensively expounded the common ideas of China and Africa regarding major international issues such as establishing a new international political and economic order , determined that China and Africa will build an enduringly stable new-style strategic partnership of equality and mutual benefit , and also set down new lines of thought for Sino-African cooperation in substantive fields such as economics and trade .  
He stressed that China always maintains that the remaining issues of the Gulf War should be solved justly and reasonably on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council , and urges that the relevant parties should , proceeding from safeguarding sustainable peace , stability and development , demonstrate political goodwill and adopt a flexible and pragmatic attitude in order to create favorable conditions for an early settlement of the issues left from the Gulf War .  
Ever since President Museveni assumed office in 1986 , in particular , greater headway has been registered in the development of friendly relations of cooperation between our two countries ; and our cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields have yielded fruitful results .  
Now , Chen Shui-bian has made the three-step proposal of " from economic and trade integration to cultural integration and further to political integration " which sublates the bipolar thinking between reunification and independence and attempts to lay a foundation of mutual-benefit for cross-strait relations and build a new framework of interaction for long-term peace .  This is a pragmatic thinking conducive to maintaining stability on the Taiwan Straits .  
The two governments and the two peoples always respect each other , understand each other , and support each other .  Cooperation between the two sides in the political , economic , public health , cultural , educational , and other fields has been continuously expanding .  In particular , high-level visits were exchanged more frequently between the two countries , and bilateral exchanges increased .  
At this time when the entire nation is making unremitting efforts to realize the " 10th Five Year " plan , the heretical " Falungong " organization has stirred up trouble again and again , wreaked social havoc , interfered with the normal lives of the masses , and acted as an anti-China tool of hostile Western powers .  This has thoroughly exposed the sinister political motives of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " and made clear that to achieve complete victory in the struggle still requires our continued efforts .  
The ulterior motive of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult in spreading rumors to confuse the public , breaking the law and creating trouble is to create chaos and social disorder in China , disrupt people 's normal work , study and daily life , and interfere with the central task of economic development , so that they can realize their political aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Chinese communist party and changing China 's socialist system .  
He stressed the need to further promote the development of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges , promote the realization of direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait at an earlier date , and the need to seriously listen to the voice of Taiwan compatriots , increase exchanges with all political parties , organizations , and people in Taiwan who oppose division and support national reunification , and jointly make efforts to promote the development of cross-strait relations and realize the motherland 's complete reunification .  
Finally , Ji Peiding said : All the countries visited by Vice President Hu in this trip are developing countries .  Thus , the visit played an important role and produced a far-reaching impact on strengthening our country 's unity and cooperation with developing countries , promoting the process of establishing a new international political and economic order of being fair and reasonable , and promoting the comprehensive development of China 's friendly and cooperative relations with these five countries in the 21st century .  
On the UN peace-keeping operations , Tang Jiaxuan emphasized : The UN reforms regarding the aspect of peace-keeping operations should be favorable for promoting the political resolutions of disputes and conflicts .  All those basic principles which have been proven effective through practice should not be neglected .  The UN Security Council should play a leading role in this regard .  
He fully affirmed the corps ' work , saying : A while ago , the " Falungong " heretical organization continued to gather people to make troubles .  The people 's police officers and men of this corps firmly held to their sense of having a high degree of political responsibility and sensitivity , struggled persistently and unyieldingly , and determinedly smashed the heretical organization 's attempts to create troubles on various occasions making use of major events and important festivals , making outstanding contributions to ensuring the capital 's social and political stability .  
They held that the year 2000 which just passed was a year of landmark significance in the process of development in our country , as the national economy maintained a rather rapid development speed , the building of democratic politics made steady progress , the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system was further improved , and favorable conditions were created for us to comprehensively build our country into comparatively well-off society and speed up the process of socialist modernization in the new century .  
In their speeches , they also put forward opinions and proposals on how to better maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , further deepen reforms , promote sustained economic development , safeguard the political situation of stability and unity , enhance socialist democracy and the building of the legal system , and advance the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the new year .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
Let us closely rally around the CPC central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , keep firm confidence , get united and work cooperatively with one heart and one mind , continue to maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , consolidate and strengthen the most extensive patriotic united front , and join hands in striving for the realization of the grand objectives and the fulfillment of the three major tasks in the new century .  
Wan added that he was glad to see some Taiwan political parties and organizations visited and established ties with the mainland one after another ; industrial and commercial enterprises successively broke the restriction of " no haste , be patient " and made investments in the mainland ; there are mounting calls in Taiwan for direct " three links " ; and the anti - " independence " and pro-reunification forces have been growing .  The motherland 's reunification has become the focus of attention of the Chinese from around the world .  
He has even advocated the " two-state theory " in disguised form .  This has not only made cross-strait relations more complicated and perilous , but also created chaotic political and economic situations on the island , thereby thwarting the aspirations of the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots for peace , stability , and development .  These perverse acts have met with hard blows given by Chinese at home and abroad , including alumni of Huangpu Military Academy .  
On the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , we will further develop ties of friendship and cooperation with countries around the world , actively push forward the process of world multipolarization , make efforts to play our proper role in international affairs , and make new contributions to establishing a fair and rational new international political and economic order , preserving world peace , and promoting common development .  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
Li Hongzhi , however , who has thrown in his lot with western anti-China forces , has refused to give up his evil designs ; he has repeatedly disseminated his fallacies of " ascend to heaven on consummation , " " go beyond forbearance , " and " cause blood to flow , " and hoodwinked and incited " Falungong " diehards who are mentally controlled by him to make a reckless move , not even stinting to being content that " Falungong " addicts should die in order to reach his unspeakable political goals .  
As for those cadres who have a poor ideological and political quality , especially those who are found to have abused power for personal gains and have failed to remain honest in performing their official duties , we must firmly refuse to use them .  
The CYL organizations at all levels should be fully aware that opposing " Falungong " is a long-term , intense , and complicated struggle , which is also , in essence , a serious political struggle ; should extensively mobilize or unite the broad masses of the CYL members or youth to wage a firm and thorough struggle against " Falungong , " which is an evil cult ; should play a role as a vital new force in a struggle aimed at exposing or repudiating " Falungong " as an evil cult ;  
He pointed out : Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " evil cult have become a political tool of the Western anti-China forces .  To achieve their sinister political purpose , they spread fallacies to hoodwink the public again and again , instigated diehard " Falungong " members to incite mob disturbances again and again .  Now , they even took more desperate actions and went as far as driving obsessed followers to commit suicide .  
People must be clearly aware of the sinister and malicious attempt of the evil cult .  Luo Haocai stressed : The horrifying suicide incident once again showed that our struggle against the " Falungong " evil cult is a round of serious political struggle , and we must fully realize that the struggle will last over a long time and is arduous and complicated .  While doing a good job in educating and transforming obsessed " Falungong " followers , it is also necessary to resolutely punish diehard members of the evil cult according to the laws .  
The political system may vary from one country to another , but all countries in the world share the same task of cracking down on evil cults and drug trafficking .  He called on all nations in the world to make joint efforts to thoroughly eliminate evil cults and drugs by casting aside their political differences and join hands in building a healthier and better living environment for all human being and creating a clean world without drugs , without pollution , without evil cults , and without spiritual opium for future generations .  
Participating jurists pointed out that Li Hongzhi and his evil " Falungong " cult were the plotters and instigators of the case in which a number of stubborn " Falungong " members set themselves on fire at Tienanmen Square . By doing so these " Falungong " members did themselves bodily harm , abused human rights , and seriously broke China 's criminal law .  It is necessary to crack down on these people according to law to guard the authority and sanctity of the law and to maintain political stability and unity .  
The open letter emphasized : " The Chinese Government 's ban of the cultish organization of ' Falungong ' is a correct measure and the actual deed to safeguard the country 's political power and social stability , the sound mind and body of the people and the personal interests of the Chinese people .  It is to uphold the basic human rights of the Chinese people , which is purely an internal affair of China . "  
The comrades engaged in publicizing political and legal affairs and the comprehensive management of public order must solidly foster their political consciousness , as well as their awareness about the overall situation , responsibility , and position , continue to persist in highlighting the main trend , and uphold the predominance of unity , stability , exertion of efforts , and positive publicity in order to create a good public opinion atmosphere for reform , development , and the maintenance of stability .  
Leading comrades in charge of the work of publicizing political and legal affairs and the comprehensive management of public order in the party committees and the political and legal affairs commissions of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the central government , as well as the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps ; leading officials of the relevant units and departments of the Central Commission for the Comprehensive Management of Public Order ; and leading officials of the relevant departments of all major central news units were present at the meeting .  
They acted in cahoots with some organizations opposing the central government and harassing Hong Kong , worked in concert with the inland " Falungong " cult organization , and cooperated closely with foreign anti-China forces to do whatever they pleased by exploiting Hong Kong 's special political environment .  They directed the spearhead of their attack at the central government and the Special Administrative Region government , causing great worries and restlessness among the great majority of Hong Kong residents .  
Le Kha Phieu spoke highly of the fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and military fields between Vietnam and China and appreciated China 's great achievements in reform and opening up .  He also said Vietnam attaches great importance to China 's experience and believes that the friendly cooperation between the two countries and the two armed forces will surely develop better in the new century .  
Zhu Rongji , premier of the State Council , today held talks with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien at the Great Hall of the People . Both sides extensively and deeply exchanged opinions on political , economic , and trade relations between China and Canada and on major international and regional affairs .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou yesterday told Hong Kong 's elite and international figures that the people of Hong Kong are assured under " one country , two systems , " and he is pleased to see the successful implementation of " one country , two systems " in Hong Kong . However , he added that Taiwan 's historical conditions and political situation are different from those of Hong Kong , so , if " one country , two systems " is compellingly implemented in Taiwan , the people of Taiwan will feel resentful .  
As a matter of fact , this time it was even more unjustified for Yoshiro Mori to use the same excuse as Putin did , because what the boat capsize incident involved are not limited simply to technical problems such as searching for the survivors , but also political and diplomatic issues of crucial importance to Japan such as relations between Japan and the United States . As the Prime Minister , how could he use the excuse " not right to intervene " ?  
Along with the development of the socialist market economy , the law governing the exchange of commodities will easily produce corrosive influences in social political life and people 's spiritual realm , give rise to the disregard of moral principles in pursuit of profits and the exchange of power for money , and lead to the weakening of the state and collective awareness and the spirit of mutual assistance and dedication .  
China , as a friendly neighbor of Cambodia , supports the Cambodian people 's endeavor in consolidating national reconciliation , safeguarding national sovereignty , and developing the economy .  China believes that , under the leadership of King Sihanouk , the Cambodian people certainly can successfully deal with all the internal and external challenges , surmount their difficulties , and build Cambodian into a country with happy people enjoying national harmony , political stability , and economic prosperity .  
It is understood that the political circles in Guangxi have been " shocked by the repercussions " of former NPC Vice Chairman Cheng Kejie 's case during the past year .  Some senior officials who had benefited from Cheng Kejie or were suspected of personal involvement have been living in apprehension under mounting criticism .  They have been ill at ease for fear of " stepping into the shoes of Chairman Cheng . "  
After two years ' crackdown , Falungong 's influence has weakened but its latent forces are still very strong .  They rely on Western forces to stir up trouble from time to time , threatening social stability and economic development .  Thus , the anti-Falungong campaign is a political struggle bearing on the stability of political power and on lasting social order .  
Relying on the grassroots level party organizations , Ningxia clearly pointed out the focus of education , adopted the method of running study classes on the legal system , and conducted meticulous ideological and political education among the infatuated followers .  
Since the founding their diplomatic relations almost 30 years ago , particularly over the last few years , the two countries ' relations have developed and they have conducted fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and educational fields as well as in international and regional affairs .  
The Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee held a forum today to study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " running the country with virtue . "  According to their personal experiences and the characteristics of their respective work , some experts and scholars , comrades who had long been engaged in ideological and political work , and responsible officials of relevant departments in the capital talked glowingly about what they had gained from studying this important thinking .  
We should guarantee the normal operation of political power at the grassroots level and establish a supervising and managing system for the reduction of peasants ' burdens .  We should continue to straighten up wanton collection of fees by middle and primary schools in rural areas , wanton collection of water and power charges in rural areas , apportioning of fees for newspaper , and demanding money and things for activities in order to achieve certain targets .  
As the principal responsible person of a local party committee , he abandoned the proper political responsibility of a leading cadre , discarded the principles of party spirit , became a crony of an illicit foreign businessman , went in for bartering power for money in a big way , led a number of cadres astray , damaged the party style and social atmosphere , ruined the party 's image , and damaged state interests , causing serious consequences to local economic and social development .  
After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .  But in the end , because of the restrictions imposed by the social and political environment at that time , the opposite result was the outcome , with the base for future taxes actually increasing , and the farmers ' burden was heavier .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou emphasized yesterday that the National Unification Guidelines is a strategic and practical document based on legal principle .  Moreover , the guidelines take into account the spirit of the Constitution and current political situation in the Taiwan Strait and have played a guiding role over the last 10 years of cross-strait relations in serving as a link between the past and the future .  
Some senior central officials even feel that by changing the " 4 June incident " from " upheaval " to " disturbance , " Jiang Zemin 's political attitude toward such a major political incident , whose nature has been determined by the central authorities , is equivocal and will encourage political opposition and the trend of bourgeois liberalization .  
Many facts show that " Falungong " has all major features of a modern evil cult .  What it did seriously harmed the physical and mental health of the practitioners , infringed upon the interests of the masses , and gravely disrupted our country 's economic construction , social order , and political stability .  
It is common knowledge that the Tiananmen area is an important venue where the party and the state hold major state and diplomatic events and a high-profile mecca for Chinese and foreign tourists .  It is the political , cultural , and international exchange center of our country and represents and symbolizes the Chinese nation , so it occupies an extremely important position .  
In our struggle against the " Falungong " cult , we conscientiously implemented the spirit of a series of instructions from the party center , gave full play to the advantage of ideological and political work , and offered all-dimensional help and education .  We managed to transform an overwhelming majority of those who practiced " Falungong " and , in particular , helped 43 fanatic followers of " Falungong " free themselves from their spiritual shackles .  
On the one hand , the bloody conflicts between Palestine and Israel , which have been going on for several months , still can not be settled in the foreseeable future and Israel 's political situation currently is still changing - - these have posed a rigorous test to the Middle East peace process .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
His conduct constituted crimes of smuggling ordinary goods , accepting bribes , embezzlement , unauthorized partitioning of state-owned assets and possessing large amounts of property of unaccountable origins .  Due to the enormous amount of money involved and the especially serious circumstances , in the judgment of first instance , he was sentenced to death , deprived of political rights for life , and subjected to confiscation of all personal property .  
The troops were explicitly required to tightly grasp the fundamental link of keeping firm ideal and belief and adopting the scientific world outlook of Marxism in the struggle of exposing and denouncing " Falungong . " Officers and servicemen were told to distinguish the right from the wrong on principle issues , lay a firm ideological foundation , increase their political immunity .  
In the whole Army , over 1,000 retired cadre housing quarters organized retired cadres to study and receive education in the forms of giving party lectures and carrying out inner-party organizational activities around the subject of " firmly keeping the ideal and belief , maintaining political integrity in our late years . "  The retired cadres were guided to consciously take the lead in exposing and denouncing " Falungong " and keep a firm political position , keep a new idea , and keep the revolutionary ideal .  
Effectively stopping channels for the infiltrative influence of various wrong ideas , enlivening the cultural life in the barracks , and creating a positive and progressive ideological and political environment .  All units persistently integrated ideological education with the strict enforcement of discipline and with strict troop management .  
With the idea of " future one China " that appeared in Chen Shui-bian 's inauguration speech and the " political integration " proposal in his new year message , the mainland , which used to squint at him , has more or less opened their eyes .  The grim situation of confrontation across the strait since the second half of last year has changed or is making a change .  On the other hand , however , the deadlock has not been broken despite the ease of tension to some extent .

They should educate and guide the broad ranks of employees to carry forward the working class 's fine tradition of having the cardinal principles in mind and taking the overall situation into account , correctly look upon the adjustments to interest relations in the course of reform from the perspective of masters , conscientiously ensure that short-term interests submit to long-term interests and local interests submit to overall interests , and strive to maintain the stability of the employee contingent and social and political stability .  
Practice has proven that adhering to and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the communist party and strengthening the CPC 's close cooperation with all democratic parties and friends from all quarters is of important significance to reinforcing and developing the great solidarity and great alliance , promoting the development of our common cause , and achieving lasting order and stability in the country .  
Firstly , it requires party committees and leading cadres with party membership at all levels to further enhance their ideological understanding , fully recognize the superiority of this basic political system of our country , gain a deep understanding of the distinct features of China 's political party system , study and acquire knowledge of the glorious history of our party cooperating with democratic parties , and enhance their consciousness in cooperating with democratic parties .  
At the same time , it also warned the handful of " Taiwan independence " diehards not to go against the tide of history and not to take political risks with the well-being and future of Taiwan compatriots as their chips out of ulterior motives , for this is very dangerous .  Doing so would only bring a huge disaster to the people of Taiwan and is bound to meet with resolute opposition from all Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots .  
Active efforts should be made to study and explore new forms and new methods for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work among the elderly under the present new situation , and to carry out the ideological and political work among the elderly in a practical , flexible , thoroughgoing , and meticulous manner , so that the great majority of old people can enjoy a colorful , healthy , and civilized way of living in their remaining years .  
They should seriously implement the important " three represents " thinking , devote more efforts to political construction , and unswervingly arm their minds with Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the series of important theses by President Jiang so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation , consolidate the spiritual pillar , and build a strong mental defense line .  
Safeguarding the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is our most cardinal political principle and discipline and represents the basic interests of the state , the nation , and the broad masses of people .  All officers and men of the PLA must have a highly unified thinking , maintain a very firm attitude , and act on their own initiative .  
Only when a stable political and social environment is maintained can the Hong Kong citizens live and work in peace and happiness , carry out normal economic activities , steadily meet emergency and seek progress in the increasingly fierce international economic competition , and remain invincible .  
We must persistently abide by the provisions of the Basic Law with regard to the political , economic , and social systems in the HKSAR , and adhere to the important principles , which are defined in the Basic Law , of placing the administration in the leading position , participating in the social affairs in a balanced fashion , and developing democracy step by step in an orderly way , so as to maintain a stable political system .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Guangdong must continue to act on Comrade Jiang Zemin 's instructions , namely " creating new strengths and reaching a higher level . "  First of all , Guangdong must give play to its political , institutional , and geographical advantages and speed up changing the government functions and improving the market economic order so as to become the forerunner in establishing and improving the socialist market economic system .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "  
All the armed forces stood up to the rigorous tests of complicated international and domestic situations as well as military and political struggles , always kept a high degree of stability , centralization , and unification , and accomplished with flying colors such tasks as conducting major military exercises , fighting floods and dealing with emergencies , holding a military review in celebration of the 50th founding anniversary of the PRC , and assuming the defense responsibilities in Hong Kong and Macao , making important contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
Our persistence in placing ideological and political construction above all other kinds of construction in the armed forces is aimed to ensure that the party is in firm control of the armed forces ideologically and politically under a complicated situation and amid deep social changes and that our armed forces are always placed under the absolute leadership of the party and will never their nature as a people 's army .  
Speaking on building stronger contingents of procuratorial personnel and improving their competency and law enforcing efficiency , Han Zhubin said : The National Procuratorial College , during the course of studying and implementing the important " three represents " thinking and working hard to improve the political awareness and professional competency of procuratorial personnel , trained more than 200 procuratorial officers before they were promoted to serve as chief procurators .  By the end of the year , local procuratorates also had trained one-third of their procuratorial officers on a rotational basis .  
NPC Deputy Wu Xiyuan said : The system of the people 's congress , the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , and the system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities are great political achievements that our party has attained and developed during the course of leading the people to carry out a long-term struggle , are the core contents of our socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics , and are a historical choice made by all the Chinese people . 
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
On the eve of the " two sessions , " the NPC Standing Committee approved the decision to amend the Regional National Autonomy Law , thus extensively overhauling the Regional National Autonomy Law adopted in 1984 .  In the original foreword , " regional national autonomy " was defined as " a major political system of the state . "  Now it is defined as " a basic political system of the state , " which fully expresses the nationality policy of the party and the government .  
The party and government organizations at all levels must set great store by building a contingent of political and legal affairs workers while the financial departments at all levels must provide political and legal affairs organs , administrative organs , as well as law enforcement organs with necessary funds so that such organs may more effectively crack down on all sorts of criminals and safeguard our market economic order or social stability .  
Proceeding from this , we have decided on the basic line of " one center and two basic points , " and drawn up the basic economic , political , and cultural outline for building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and a whole series of guidelines and policies suited to our actual conditions ; as a result China has stood firm amid the constantly changing international situation , and achieved successes acknowledged by the whole world , advancing from victory to new victory .  
We should pay attention to properly doing ideological and political work aiming at achieving specific purposes , step up publicizing relevant policies , and strengthen education in the rule of law .  Based on the principle of making prevention the primary means , persuasion through education , handling problems according to law , and preventing intensification of contradictions , we should use economic , educational , and legal means to properly deal with all kinds of contradictions in order to ensure that reform and opening up and socialist modernization are carried out smoothly .  
Raidi said that Tibet is China 's only provincial-level governmental unit which lacks railway access .  The decision of the central Party authorities and the State Council to build the Qinghai-Tibet railway is an important part of China 's grand strategy of developing the west , a happy event in the political and economic life of the Tibetan people and something longed for by the Tibetan people for generations .  
The rapidly developing trend of economic globalization that has come at the heels of the new century and the rising tides of the third industrial revolution that are sweeping the world will change the economic , political and cultural order of the world in profound ways .

During the discussion , Deputy Gyaincain Norbu and Deputy Li Guohua said : Over the past year , the " two supremes " have played a vital role in cracking down in accordance with the law on " Falungong , " which is an evil cult , in training personnel involved in the political and legal work in western regions , in striking at ethnic separatists , and other aspects , and have stepped up self-building as well .  
They pointed out : The key to building a contingent of highly qualified personnel for political and legal work lies in personnel .  We must firmly control entry and ensure smooth exit and must work hard to build a contingent of clean and honest personnel known for a firm political stand , professional proficiency , a fine style , and moral integrity .  
The financial departments at all levels must guarantee funds for the " two supremes " in normal operation and must earnestly help departments involved in political and legal work in remote border areas , poor areas , or areas inhabited by ethnic minorities tackle the problem of lack of funds .

The advanced character of the party should be eventually reflected from each party member 's specific words and deeds .  Only when each party member and cadre are strict with themselves , always place themselves under the supervision of party organizations and the masses , keep tempering and cultivating themselves in party spirit , raise their political consciousness and moral standards , and maintain strict standards in work , daily life , and social intercourse will they be able to ward off the corrosive influence and never become corrupt .

That a degree of care and attention is required , particularly in relation to the unique situation embodied in One Country , Two Systems , and the specific intent and spirit of our constitutional imperatives , i.e . the requirements of the Basic Law . "  
This is because we have already found a right road of development suited to China 's national conditions , secured a stable social and political situation , acquired quite a solid material and technological base , and possessed a large market and rich resources , and finally we have 1.2 billion industrious and talented people .  
We must make good use of these years to enhance public awareness of community affairs , to help them acquire experience in elections , and let them have a better understanding of the political system , thereby enabling them to participate in the discussion of the future constitutional development of the HKSAR in a mature and prudent manner .

Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .

Basically a type of pre-inked stamps , the chops are " dressed " in a sharp but neutral colour - the orange colour , which is chosen not because it is one of the popular colours for fashion in this fall season , but because it is a colour not affiliated with any political parties so far .

The language benchmark initiative arose from the Education Commission Report No . 6 , published in 1996 after two rounds of public consultation , which recognised the urgent need in Hong Kong to enhance the proficiency of Chinese ( including Putonghua ) and English of young people in order to meet changing political , economic , social and cultural demands . 
" I have no doubt that the long term goal of the community of Hong Kong is to have a stable political structure providing a constructive and workable relationship between our executive-led government and a legislature elected through universal suffrage .  Many stakeholders are involved .  The administration will be expected to take a lead in coming up with alternative proposals .

Many stakeholders are involved .  The administration will be expected to take a lead in coming up with alternative proposals .  
As the unfair and unreasonable international political and economic order has not been fundamentally changed yet , economic globalization has exacerbated the uneven development among countries and regions and widened , in particular , the gap between the North and the South and between the rich and the poor .  
During its stay in the United Kingdom , France and Germany , the delegation will meet with Ministers , senior civil servants , academics and experts in constitutional law , think-tank bodies as well as non-government organizations concerned .

" On the one hand , the Administration has a responsibility to ensure that civil servants receive fair and reasonable treatment without being subjected to political influence .  On the other hand , we are duty-bound to ensure that the civil service system , including the mechanism for determining and adjusting pay levels , will continue to be accepted and supported by the public , " Mr Wong said in his letter to all civil servants .

Furthermore , following the return of Hong Kong to the motherland , and with the elected Chief Executive , a fully elected legislature , the increasingly progressive and aggressive media , Government operation and policy formulation are subject to increasing public scrutiny and pressure .  In addition to expectation for Principal Officials to undertake their statutory duties , they have to cover political work within the community .  
Mr Wong continued : " In addition , the Principal Officials will be required as a condition of their contract to uphold the principle of maintaining a permanent , political neutral , professional and honest civil service system .

The replacement of HOS flats by housing loans aims at a clearer role for both public and private sector housing markets , and provides a more certain operating environment to the private property market .  This policy is keeping in line with the prevailing political , social and economic reality of Hong Kong , and strikes a balance between the interests of the general public and people from various sectors .  The community has generally expressed positive comments to the Government 's announcement .  
These factors included political stability and security , rule of law and an independent judiciary , corruption free government , infrastructure , press and information freedom , a sturdy banking and financial system and a low and simple tax regime .  
Meanwhile , a new ' ministerial ' system has just been introduced , with politically appointed and accountable non-civil service ' ministers ' , including those drawn from business and professional sectors as well as the leading political parties , forming a new cabinet to support a coordinated and focussed government agenda .

The Summit , held from October 6 to 8 , is attended by leading political figures within and outside the region , as well as business leaders representing major multinational companies and prominent regional corporations .  
The favourable ratings given to the five most important factors - low and simple tax system ; political stability and security ; free flow of information ; rule of law and independent judiciary ; and corruption-free government - point to why Hong Kong remains the preferred location for regional operations in this region .  
And it will not condone any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , colour , descent , or national or ethnic origin , which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life , " Ms Chan explained .  
Lastly , we all agreed that if Hong Kong was to enjoy a healthy development across the whole economic , political and social spectrum , we must make every effort to maintain stability and stay united .  We must also ensure Hong Kong and the Mainland develop a good interactive relationship within the " One Country , Two Systems " framework .  In short , all of us should work together towards this objective .  
Six years after reunification , we in Hong Kong remain true to the values and institutions that buttress our development as a separate social , economic and political system from the Mainland ; a free society under the rule of law and an open , pluralistic , tolerant and outward-looking community . " 
It stressed that both leaders were gratified by the continuous development in political , economic and technical relations between their countries . They shared identical ideals and aspirations , the communique stated , believing as they did that the foundation of traditional friendship , based on high moral principles and fraternal solidarity , was both firm and enduring . The king and the president reaffirmed the common cause of their countries and peoples in upholding peace , freedom and human rights and opposing all forms of aggression , oppression and prejudice .  
During the campaign period , candidates pasted up posters in prominent positions and rode around in campaign vans plastered with photographs , slogans , and each candidate 's designated number , haranguing the crowds over loudspeakers . A total of 3,002 open-air rallies , arranged by the government for candidates to state their opinions publicly , were attended by thousands of voters , who showed particular interest in political affairs and local administration .  
This sums up events in the past century when millions of Chinese suffered under the experiments of various political systems , including constitutional monarchy , socialism and Communism . During the past 30 years , detente and power politics have dominated the world arena . As a result , justice , truth and moral courage have been obscured , and adverse tides have continued to buffet the nation . With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
He further remarked that the Chinese people place equal emphasis on human nature , reasonableness and law . The work of the mediation council is based on the first two considerations , and the agreements it makes possible must have legal standing . Mayor Lee said that the function of mediation councils is a unique feature in the nation 's political history . He is convinced that once the mediation council fully develops its role , people will no longer need to go to the courts to settle their disputes .  
Doctors rarely engage in basic research work , it was pointed out . Furthermore , while there is a great deal of advanced technological equipment , there is a lack of people qualified to use it . The Republic of China 's standing in medical organizations was threatened a few years ago by political factors .  
According to statistics which appeared in a local paper , major political issues raised by candidates were the upgrading of the livelihood of farmers ; promotion of administrative reform ; raising of salaries of government officials , public functionaries and teachers ; increasing social welfare ; building more residential districts ; increasing benefits to workers ; improving traffic conditions ; providing better flood control measures ; and working generally for the good of the people .  
Tainan can not compare with Taipei as a political and economic center , and has little chance to catch up with Kaohsiung 's industrial development . But Mayor Su intends to restore Tainan 's faded glory . " We hope to create a city that is both comfortable to live in and enjoyable to visit , " he says .  
At that time the social order was stable the economy was thriving and the suburbs of Changan and Loyang were thickly populated . The capital , Changan , was the political , economic , and cultural center of Asia .  
These character inscriptions provide valuable information as to the life during this early period of Chinese history . The late years of the Chou marked the beginning of a long period of political instability throughout north and east China . This period which is recorded in the classic annals of " the Spring and Autumn " ( 722-484 BC ) saw China divided up into rival kingdoms , each with their own written language .  
From then until the late nineteenth century , Tainan served as the political , cultural and economic center of Taiwan . Its rich history has left Tainan with a heritage of cultural landmarks and scholarly contributions unmatched elsewhere on the island .  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics . This , together with other changing objective conditions , has made ' lifting martial law ' and ' opening up the formation of new political parties ' a natural decision , " says government spokesman Chang King-yuh .  
One newspaper editorial has commented that Yu has been both unfortunate and fortunate to have served for these last three turbulent years . On the one hand , the pace of political , economic , and social change has been extremely rapid , even chaotic .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
A democratic government has been the goal which China has been long searching for in recent years , but after the Chinese Communists ' abrupt rise , the value of this democratic theory which is applicable everywhere has been muddled and its role confused under the fighting among the political parties of China .  
Now Taiwan is in a period of intense change ; the economy is thriving and " political fever " is common . Each is centered on its own development . Each has its heroes . In a modern society where we are particular about equal development , this is something rather dangerous .  
During his eight years at Chinese opera school , Ma threw himself with total energy into mastering the techniques of this demanding art , and he became an instant stage success after his graduation in 1959 . Unfortunately , in the political context of the time , his aristocratic family background proved to be a major stumbling block in his artistic career .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
So starting from the present , the party should expand the channels for participation and communication , so that party members and cadres have ample opportunity to express their opinions . A view of the current political situation reveals ever-changing and treacherous trends and widespread military conflict . The antagonism between the two extremes of freedom and slavery as well as of democracy and totalitarianism has never let up in the least .  
This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .  
Most of the changes are clearly positive ; however , some have caused us to take a second look at where we are going . Our government and people are now in the position of having to come up with quick answers to a wide range of new and challenging questions . Unlike many nations of the West that have had well over a century to gradually adjust to political and economic modernization , the Republic of China is having to compact this development into the short span of a few decades .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University . When official astronomers witnessed an unusual celestial event , they would attach some forced political meaning to it , and rarely explored for the objective truth .  
Two centuries of adaptation and hard work combined with changing political and economic factors have made " the smooth integration of the Chinese into the multicultural society of Hawaii one of the rare success stories in the history of world immigration , " as Professor Clarence E . Glick of the University of Hawaii , noted for his research on the subject , has put it .  
Although fiercely competitive , this channel of selection and replacement assists in social integration . ( 2 ) A gradual increase in the average level of education and expertise of elected officials has helped increase the efficiency and capability of the political system . ( 3 ) Native Taiwanese have a comparatively better chance of serving in public office through elections , while mainlanders often pass through other recruitment channels .  
Wang served with Yin Chung-jung , K . T . Li , Chao Yao-tung , and other famous leading figures in the world of economics and finance . He can rely on a rich background and thirty years ' training at mediating views to handle the coordination and communications among the various economic and financial ministries . This will enable Premier Lee to focus on mapping out the nation 's political and economic future .  
However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
Steadily Advancing Our Mainland Work " Building up Taiwan to recover the mainland " is a fundamental government policy . With the chief goals of our political call to the mainland being democracy , freedom , unification , and prosperity for all , we must advance our work in a steady , active , and positive manner while paying heed at all times to the political , economic , and social situation .  
If both the government and the people adhere to the established policies of political democratization , economic liberalization , societal pluralization , and cultural sinification ; if they speed the development of democratic politics and maintain stable economic growth ; and if they progress in related social and cultural respects - - all this will mean that all sectors in our nation will develop in a balanced way and forge ahead jointly .  
Under political party competition , society has the right to ask that the parties and the candidates they put forward have a high degree of ' political responsibility ' and meet the competitive ethics of party politics , " says Kao Hui-yu , a reporter for the United Daily News . Similarly , candidates need to promote a sense of public responsibility in order to change voters ' thinking from passive mobilization into active participation .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
Fellow Countrymen , Distinguished Guests : Over two thousand years ago , Chinese culture gave birth to the ideal of a great world commonwealth of peace and prosperity . The political , economic , and social systems and goals that it entails are in full accord with those implemented and sought by modern free and democratic nations .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .  
Although mainland China 's initial responses are far from friendly , you still keep calling on them to make a rational choice . I think the people are most concerned with the question of when conditions may become ripe . What I mean is that given your understanding and knowledge of the world situation and the political developments in mainland China , when do you think conditions will become ripe for talks between the two sides as equals ? Thank you , Mr . President .  
Several of the most popular areas of research , such as the encroachment of Western imperialism on China , Christianity in China , Chinese political philosophy and the spread of education were all aimed at gaining a quick understanding of modern China , and areas not related to contemporary China were neglected .  
According to research by Hsia Li-ming associate professor at Taitung Normal College , there is a marked difference between Chinese imperial maps , produced to meet the political and military requirements of the court , and European navigation charts of the same period , where the commercial interest is foremost .  
Their letter was earnest . The gist of it was that they felt close to the characters in my books and very much wanted to talk with me . . . . There was only a scattering of overseas Chinese in Europe 27 or 28 years ago , and the term " overseas Chinese community " was practically unheard of . As few as we were , under the shadow of the political climate of the time , we fell into two clearly defined camps , the line crossed only by a handful .  
Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
Nevertheless , since ancient times major affairs of state have been seen as the center of political activity , and are what most people think of when they think of ' politics , ' " says Yeh . This is a distortion of a paternalistic society - - promoting invasiveness , and lacking in acceptance and tolerance - - which defined the political core , but it is by no means the only or normal nature of politics .  
Then there are those harshly judgmental types in " little theater " who feel the groups like Ping-Fong Acting Troupe and the Performance Workshop are practically commercial in nature and that they make use of superficial political clich ? s and catchwords to create an " overripe , saturated urban space " that 's pretty to look at and easy to digest but lacking in substance .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
Feeling illegal : There are more mainland spouses here illegally who have n't been exposed by the media . Some of them may have married because they longed for Taiwan 's political and economic stability or wanted to live here and could n't find a job back home or even because they fell into clutches of the white slave trade .  
In our original conception , there would be nine items for evaluation - - those being , besides the eight main powers of legislators , also adding one item for " constituent service . " There are four criteria for evaluation - - whether the legislator effectively promotes a balance with the executive ; whether the legislator 's attitude in interpellations is reasonable ; the extent to which expressed political views are realized in practice ; and whether or not the legislator follows the constitution . ( However , we do n't include ideology . )  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
When , in 1989 , the Chinese Communists committed the horrendous atrocity of the Tienanmen massacre in full view of the world 's media , Western governments were finally roused from their dreaming . The last threads of the illusion they had built up concerning the movement of China 's communist authorities towards democracy were broken . In stark contrast , the liberalization and process of political normalization on this side of the Taiwan Strait led the West to begin to accept the ROC as a member of the democratic camp . "  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
The road is named after the Chinese hero Tran Hung-dao , who led the Vietnamese in resistance against the invading Mongol armies of the Yuan dynasty in the fourteenth century . To the east of the road is the Vietnamese political and economic center ( now the first and third districts ) , while to the west is Tan An ( the fifth and sixth districts ) .  
Especially in 1981 , just three years after the United States broke off diplomatic relations , and with a sensitive atmosphere still lingering two years after the riots of the Kao-hsiung Incident . Although her parents had never filled her with any kind of political consciousness , Hsin Chi-ming had still , from a young age , got a fuzzy stereotyped idea that anyone who had anything to do with the 228 Incident was a thoroughly bad person , so you can imagine how she panicked .  
The memoir 's depiction of the events of the Cultural Revolution , however , does convince a reader that the deliberate selfishness of leaders , combined with the wrong political system , allowed the evil and selfish in people to run wild . Only people of excellent character could lend a helping hand or show a little gentleness .  
Q : Because the Three Gorges project is extremely complex , there are many different opinions pro and con . Those opposed accuse the political leaders of simply liking grandiose white elephants while ignoring the ecology and the overall interests of the nation . Those who approve say that the dam could resolve the eternal problem of flooding on the Yangtze , and feel that this enormous project would enable the country to become wealthy and strong , creating a chance to do something unparalleled in the world .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
By the same token , those people who hope that the government can start political discussions on this subject with the Chinese Communists as soon as possible are apt to be accused of demeaning themselves and strengthening the enemy 's hand , while those who propose ignoring the Chinese Communists and appealing directly for international support are accused of wishful thinking and blindness to reality , or of opportunistically seeking Taiwanese independence . . . .  
With the recent rapid economic growth in Taiwan , political liberalization , and a successful switch to a more practical approach to foreign policy , the ROC 's international status has risen , and some of the reasons used in the past for obtaining foreign passports no longer exist .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
Apart from distributing handbills covered densely with printed or brush-written characters explaining their views , they also made effective use of mobile advertisements in the form of vehicles plastered with posters . Kuo Kuo-chi has been active in politics since shortly after Taiwan returned from Japanese to Chinese rule , and was one of the " Five Tiger Generals " of the early years of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly . His quick reactions and hard-hitting style earned him the epithet " Cannon Kuo " in political circles and the media .  
In the 1983 elections to expand the Legislative Yuan , the Taipei branch of the KMT broke away from the former stereotyped dogmatic approach , and for the first time used the techniques of commercial advertising to present a packaged image in straightforward , accessible language . This also marked the first time that a commercial advertising agency was brought across the divide into political advertising .  
In terms of election demands , as the climate grew more open opinions of every political color were aired , and later the same year the DPP 's central standing committee passed its " Draft Constitution for Taiwan , " and proposed " founding an independent country . " The KMT , seizing on Taiwan 's middle classes ' collective fear of disorder and desire for stability , defined its position as one of " renewal , stability and prosperity , " while lambasting the DPP as the party of " violence and revolution . "  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
Turning to look at Chinese people 's inherited political mindset , there is implicit in it a " tacit spirit of harmonious coexistence . " This is reflected in the allocation of political representatives to each ethnic group , whereby harmonious coexistence and equal representation of the Chinese nation 's " five peoples " is striven for .  
God 's Dice collects eight of Kuo Cheng 's recent stories together . Material ranges from the middle-class escapist rhapsody of " God 's Dice , " the hell bent for leather adolescent days of " Flying Sword , " and the sordid circus antics of the political arena in " Put on a White Face , " to the driven historical mission of " The Last Proclamation " and the deranged baby killing of " How to Execute an Infant . "  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
This combination of Sun 's own words with journalistic evidence to provide both subjective and objective views was extremely well received . But in fact there are very few examples of objectively critical authorized biographies of " big league " politicians . Most authors wishing to write about political figures adopt the second-best approach of collecting material indirectly in a round-about " covert operation . "  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .  
True , in The End of the Century she still shows an intellectual 's contemplative acuity , but is that gentle and kind glowing mother of Children the same woman who wrote Wild Fire , a collection of critical political and social writings , ten years ago ?  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
Making a choice for the childQ : After Chi An became pregnant with her second child in the United States , she was unwilling to have an abortion there , and she was afraid that when she returned to mainland China she would be forced to abort . With your help , she received political asylum and stayed in the US . In fact , she never incurred any direct oppression . Why was her application successful ?  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
When he hears talk about the elements now making up the temple milieu he perks up and begins pointing all around , explaining this and that in an amiable and composed way . He points out that the courtyard outside the threshold is a " political zone . " The walkways - - which in a Chinese temple are covered and skirt the outside of the main courtyard - - are occupied by little groups of fortune-tellers , devout Buddhists , and elderly men , each conversing on their own themes .  
Although both have reasons for their beliefs , comparatively speaking the mainland 's syllabuses and textbooks contain much more of the ideology of the Communist Party and of socialism , " making it explicit that education must serve politics , " says Huang Cheng-chieh . In his view , Taiwan 's syllabuses also incorporate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People , but it is expressed in " vague and abstract terms , in the hope that it can be acceptable to everyone , and not serve a minority of political parties or interest groups . "  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
But because it was a dark era , when society was riven by sharp political differences , he adopted a muddled demeanor . When others spoke to him about some matter - - whether they described something joyous or tragic , or offered an opinion he shared or opposed - - Sima would always say , " Good . "  
Nevertheless , according to Chang Le-chi 's description , NGOs always want to keep their image of " being afraid of becoming politically sullied . " They stand somewhat aloof from authorities . They even purposefully maintain a safe distance from political figures with similar ideas , and they forbid currently unployed essential staff from running for public office , to prevent opportunists from turning social activism into a springboard for amassing personal political resources . "  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
However , from the 17th century onwards , wave after wave of immigrants flooded onto this peaceful , happy land through the harbor at Tainan , encroaching on the Sirayas ' living space . Those Siraya who did not retreat further and further south or into the mountains accepted the rule of the incoming political authority and were subsequently assimilated .  
Increasingly frequent interaction between mainland China and Taiwan , their respective political climates , and the new world order taking shape in the post-Cold-War era are of course important historical backdrops , but the ominous tone of the book 's title , and related historical events which the author used as examples , were factors leading to the sensation surrounding T-Day Many people who had never even read the book joined in the debate , some were even frightened to the point of making preparations to emigrate .  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent . According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss . With little international room to maneuver following the ROC 's withdrawal from the United Nations , Taiwan 's only asset was economic growth .  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives . These books drive home the importance of the women 's and Taiwan autonomy movements , so as to prevent society here from regressing as a result of political troubles .  
I am convinced that only when upright , insightful , capable and experienced people , regardless of their political affiliation or social group , participate in the leadership of the government will political stability and national growth be ensured .  
During the years of the preposterous and unprecedented Cultural Revolution , I finally realized that the difference between Mao Zedong and Karl Marx was that Mao extended the scope of the powerful machinery of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the political and economic sphere into the domain of the human mind .  
When mainland China 's band of political fraudsters raised high the red banner of " total dictatorship , " the minds of countless intellectuals groaned in the most abject despair in the dark corners of the " cowsheds " and prisons .  
At that time I was still young , and I escaped the dreadful fate of many old scholars and authors . Like countless millions of my compatriots I merely injected my spirited youthful emotions to that unique system of thought , and became part of a unified political machine , making my mind utter unfeeling cries .  
With reform and liberalization , China at the end of the 20th century is growing more prosperous by the day . But despite Beijing 's promises of " one country , two systems , " and " self-rule for Hong Kong " guaranteed by Hong Kong 's Basic Law , as long as the basic nature of the totalitarian communist regime has not changed and the political straitjacket has not been loosened , does Hong Kong really have nothing to fear ?  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Quite the opposite from what outsiders suspected , the principal reason for prolonging talks was in fact claims of " unfair commercial advantages . " The seemingly sensitive questions of sovereignty and political rivalry were actually secondary .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
After intensive discussion , the three parties finally agreed that the compromises achieved before the conference should not be lightly abandoned . Besides retaining the definition of the two sides of the Strait as " equal political entities , " the conference simply added proposals by Ju Gau-jeng for a " cross-strait forum " and " inviting representative persons from both sides of the Strait to participate as private individuals to peacefully resolve cross-strait issues through an exchange of opinions without any non-negotiable positions . "  
Ending class struggle gave people a breathing spell . And , in a decisive fashion , Deng removed the many labels - " landlord , " " bourgeois , " " counter-revolutionary , " " bad element , " " rightist , " and so on-from the many people erroneously branded in the many political movements of the past .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music . " In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
The Western powers were at the time entering a depression and had no energy to interfere in the affairs of the East . Secondly , blockading of the Communists was underway in Jiangxi . The Nanjing-Guangdong split had occurred , when leading military and political figures established an alternative government after the arrest of Hu Hanmin . The Yangtze also flooded with calamitous consequences , leaving millions of people dead or dislocated .  
As the president 's official photographer , Kao 's choice of angle when photographing him was tempered by the desire to maintain the national leader 's dignity . The pictures which political photojournalists love to take of politicians distressed or dispirited , yawning or picking their noses , are nowhere to be seen in Kao 's archives . " What 's the point of taking those ? When I did happen to get shots like that , I destroyed them , " says Kao .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
The ROC government had been established on Taiwan for 20 years and the fruits of land reform had provided a basis for the greater prosperity of the common people . Economic activity , primarily from public investment , was flourishing . However , the island was still under martial law , political prohibitions such as those outlawing the establishment of political parties had not yet been repealed , and the social atmosphere was tense .  
Jan Jyh-horng responded that although Taipei has never sought to avoid political negotiations aimed at eventual reunification , both Beijing and Taipei would first have to approach such negotiations with a common understanding that " the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled by separate and equal entities . "  
Recently , at the invitation of Taipei City Government , Morris Chang , chairman of the powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) , delivered a lecture entitled " New Recruits for the 21st Century . " The specification he described for modern employees included these requirements : The ability to actively participate in political and social work ; an international perspective ; taking pleasure in cooperative endeavor ; a good general understanding of science and technology ; and the ability to think independently . Finally , they should be " specialized all-rounders . "  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
Later , in Singapore , Chiu and Tang Shubei , vice chairman of ARATS , repeatedly emphasized the " four natures " of the Koo-Wang talks : non-governmental , economic , pragmatic , and functional . The two parties agreed to put aside relatively sensitive political issues that they disagreed on . Obviously these " four natures " referred not only to the Koo-Wang talks , but could also be seen as guiding principles for future handling of cross-strait relations by the associations .  
Mr . Koo did not avoid politically sensitive issues , clearly and unambiguously giving voice to the Republic of China 's political principles . And by avoiding the mainland 's trap , Mr . Koo expanded the scope of the dialogue to include the rights of the people and lured the mainland into agreeing to four points of consensus set by Taiwan . While working within the major differences outlined above , the two sides together sought out minor points to agree upon .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds . Behind this pattern was a tense military standoff with mainland China , which shelled the island of Kinmen heavily in 1958 . A number of projects designed to promote political stability and ensure economic and social survival and development were completed during these years .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
" People 's lives were wasted when they were imprisoned for many years here because of their beliefs and political views , " said Premier Vincent Siew , who spoke as master of ceremonies at the monument 's ground-breaking . " In truth , freedom of belief is a God-given right , and no one should be imprisoned for political reasons . " Past history shows us , Siew noted , that human wisdom is often distorted by mistaken judgment , with deep regrets later .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Sung Ju-shan , a lecturer at Chinese Culture University , writes in her doctoral dissertation A Decade of Post-Cultural-Revolution Literature in Mainland China , " After shifting political circumstances debunked earlier values , the Red Guards who had devoted their youth to politics were faced with an urgent need to seek new meaning in life . "  
The initial enthusiastic response was overshadowed by the 1979 Formosa Incident in Kaohsiung , but as Taiwan 's rapid economic development in the 1980s swelled the ranks of the middle classes , all kinds of political and non-political social movements gathered strength , and organizations such as Chai Sung-lin 's Consumers ' Foundation and Li Yuan-chen 's Awakening Foundation came into being .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
Taiwan is blessed with a number of lavishly gifted film-makers who are committed to their ideals , but the solemnity of whose creations perhaps deters a movie-going public raised on Hollywood and Disney . Their films , however , help serious cinema-goers in Taiwan and around the world to better confront life , and at the same time win international exposure for Taiwan , enabling the island 's more cultured aspect to break through in the face of international political taboos and wrangling .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
" During this final transitional year , " comments an editorial in the China Times , " Lee Teng-hui must do three things : construct a new parliamentary system , complete the nomination of the Kuomintang 's presidential candidate and assist in the election , and achieve a transition in political power that maintains a stable social structure . "  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Hu Tsu-ching , an associate professor of political science at Soochow University , warns that there are several problems that must be addressed : The Kosovo government-in-exile is mired in internal strife , and it must be decided which " Kosovo " to assist . Ways must be found to ensure that the aid provides practical help to the refugees , and is not diverted into private pockets . With regard to the proposed training program in Taiwan , there are problems of language , health clearance , and so on .  
At a time when other groups have achieved heightened visibility and have succeeded in winning general acceptance of their need to preserve their rights , the Hakkas are still saddled with the same old stereotypes they 've always had to live with-invisible , docile , conservative , impassive . . . . Hakka activists have to take to the street to get their own people to adopt a bit of a higher profile . A quick glance at the ranks of society 's post-martial law political and business leaders is revealing .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
The political context has been democratized during the 50 years since the government moved to Taiwan , but much still needs to be done with regard to law and order . The economy may be flourishing , but in terms of environmental protection we completely fail to make the grade . Educational levels have jumped and society is buzzing with activity , yet some of the old qualities of generosity and forbearance have been sacrificed , and we are yet to attain the innate understanding and self-awareness of a mature society .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
" Formerly , Taiwan under its authoritarian political system never cultivated mechanisms to encourage autonomy . It lacked a civil society given to self-reflection . It was n't in the habit of discussing , deliberating and making judgments , and it lacked a concern for local affairs . " Ping Lu 's soft , moderate tone reveals an undercurrent of hurt .  
At the beginning of the 1980s the political atmosphere began to loosen up . In society , consumer , environmental , women 's , labor and other movements rose up one after another , and yet education , like an impregnable fortress , remained unchanged . Looking back today , it appears that just as the various social movements started to die down , the educational-reform movement-as if having a delayed reaction to the changing times-took off full steam .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum offered visitors a peek outside the mainstream in October , exhibiting a collection of works by contemporary artists from five Central American nations . Apart from the exotic nature of the exhibit , the deep insights that the artists have incorporated into these works offer a portrait of the political , economic , cultural , and social realities of Central America today .  
With wisdom and intelligence , the people of the Han institutionalized the country 's political , economic and social systems , laying down the framework for the subsequent development of Chinese society . By the time the second millennium arrived , it was the era of the ultra-refined Song dynasty . This was a period when individual freedoms were extended , encouraging one of the most remarkable flowerings of literature , fine art and handicrafts in history .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
Fortunately , in the years since the lifting of martial law , once-downtrodden ethnic groups have begun to gain political clout and a sense of self-determination . The view that aboriginal culture must be preserved has become " politically correct " and mainstream . But social benefits to the aborigines can not depend on some fuzzy sense of charity . The aborigines need more thoughtful and efficacious aid .  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
Huang Ming-chuan , who studied law before he began making movies , has come to be seen as the standard-bearer for independent films in Taiwan . Flat Tire , which he completed two years ago , tells the story of a pair of documentary makers traveling around Taiwan to film the island 's religious and political statuary . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
The " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff . The political warfare system ( an autonomous system of political commissar-type officers , created in early Republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders ) will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change .  
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions . It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
As Liu Shao-tang explained in Volume 64 , No . 2 : " From the struggle between Sun and Huang in the early years of the Republic , through the chaos of the warlord era and the North-South standoff , to the periods of cooperation and conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists , Yu witnessed countless political struggles . He saw how much historical data was distorted or destroyed , how right was turned into wrong and black into white , and how whoever won the battles also won history .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . " Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high-technology , compassion , and peace . If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
Q : Taiwan firms have always been cooperative , and overseas investment has been very helpful to the ROC 's diplomatic work . But today the government is putting political considerations first in encouraging Taiwan firms to invest in friendly countries . From an economic point of view , how effective is this ?  
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
A number of Chinese authors have risen to fame in recent years with books published in English , including Nien Cheng , Amy Tan , Jung Chang , and Ha Jin . Now Adeline Yen Mah has joined the list with Falling Leaves : The True Story of an Unwanted Chinese Daughter . This autobiographical account focuses especially on the author 's childhood years growing up in a wealthy but abusive family in China during a time of political upheaval .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
On November 20 , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) marked its sixth month as the ruling party , but because of a long series of political disturbances during the last half year , the Chen administration 's attempt to run a " government of the whole people " crumbled , and instead it formed a minority government . Thus , the cabinet has consistently found itself a " new hand behind the wheel . " Major policies naturally have not been fully implemented , engendering an aura of dejection , and dour expectations for the economy .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
It 's fortunate , then , that the instructors at the leadership education camps put on in Taiwan this past year included figures beyond the usual line-up of political leaders featured at events sponsored by political parties . Some instructors at the camps were religious leaders and others were people making their marks in such areas as social welfare , community education or environmental protection .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
" It is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in the 20th century . Now it doubles once every three to five years , " notes Wu Se-hwa , dean of the business school at National Chengchi University . The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of the 20th century , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .  
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links . In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties . In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Not long afterwards , he was arrested by the Japanese military for a cartoon in a newspaper depicting a famous Chinese general from the Ming dynasty killing a " dwarf pirate . " ( " Dwarf pirate " has long been a derogatory term used by Chinese to refer to Japanese . ) He thereby became categorized as a " Chinese juvenile political criminal . "  
In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse . While the president in late May was traveling abroad and raising Taiwan 's international profile , bad news was breaking at home . The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
In 1996 , the ROC 's first direct presidential election marked the first time ever that Chinese people could select their own leader on a one-man , one-vote basis . But it was also when cross-strait relations reached their nadir , as the mainland undertook missile tests prior to the election , creating extreme tension . The resulting freeze in political relations created circumstances under which any national leader of Taiwan would have to make national security the top priority .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
With reference to the mainland 's ill-considered and arbitrary actions , some political commentators put forward the interpretation that with the Communist Party of China 's 16th national congress imminent and a new leadership line-up about to emerge , mainland politicians jostling for positions of power were eager to put on an impressive performance , so they adopted a more hawkish posture .  
In this crucial period of a strategic realignment of global political and economic forces , Taiwan needs to increase its opportunities for international exposure and actively participate in international activities , in order to make its voice heard . Only in this way can Taiwan truly manifest its national status and dignity .  
Her husband Li Chung-sheng , who was very accomplished at a wide range of Taiwanese Opera roles , died on stage when the gunpowder he was using for special stage effects accidentally exploded in his face . Sai herself later got into political hot water . Branded as a " capitalist roader , " she was thrown into jail for several months .  
In this showdown between political organizations , the ambitions and maneuverings of the most prominent party aristocrats are also getting considerable exposure . Looking at the structure of Taiwan 's voting population , at bottom the ratio of 60% blue vs . 40% green is quite firmly established , and parties on both sides are finding it difficult to make inroads into the other camp .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
His most fervent hope is that political leaders and the 600,000-strong army of public servants will " jointly build a culture of public service encompassing the nation 's legal system , institutions , and education system , in which public servants are conscientious , impartial , incorruptible and insightful , the talented are given their due , and those in the lower ranks have reason to be satisfied with their jobs . "  
When the participants boarded the ferry and completed the short hop to Xiamen , it constituted the first cultural exchange between Kinmen and the PRC under the newly established " three mini-links . " It was very gratifying to see the artistic occasion carried off without the slightest hint of political overtones .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
Chang Chi-luan , whom the historian Wu Hsiang-hsiang referred to as " the model Chinese newspaper man , " always held onto the spirit of a traditional Chinese man of letters . When he put out the Takungpao , he proclaimed his famous " four ' nevers ' " : " Never serve any political faction , never sell out , never be selfish , and never become blind to the truth . " Strengthening the character of Chinese newspapermen , he created a model of journalistic ethics .  
However , in contrast to the relative independence of European and American think tanks , in Taiwan , where political power has always held the upper hand over pure academic research , think tanks operate with such obvious political orientations that outsiders naturally assume that think tanks are nothing but parrots reflecting the views of the powers-that-be .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible . In fact , they are often at cross-purposes , and the resulting confusion has made it still more difficult for Taiwan to chart a course for the future .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
Most observers of the 2002 elections believe that in the past the DPP could count on the firm support of 30-40% of grassroots voters , but they are watching with keen interest to see whether this support base will be as solid this time round , following the transfer of central government power to the DPP and the political upheavals of the last two years .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
The draft bill included specific provisions defining political contributions as the outright gift of personal property or real estate , or the provision of other economic benefits , to a person or group participating in an election campaign or otherwise engaged in political activities .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .  
It had withdrawn from the United Nations and diplomatic ties with Japan had been severed . Along with the political debate , a wave of nativization swept through every level of Taiwanese society . Within the literary community , a reevaluation of the Modernism it had adopted with Westernization was unavoidable .  
In Taiwanese society at large , everyone has gained the right to freedom of expression and is able to criticize publicly the political situation , even the president and high officials . Within the literary field , a myriad of new directions have opened up . Aboriginal literature , new feminist literature , environmental literature , gay literature , and pornographic literature have taken the stage one after another , providing material for readers of every taste .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Thirty years ago , when martial was still in effect , the heavy hand of political authority held Taida in a tight grip . But the NTU spirit of never compromising was not extinguished .  
NTU 's impressive influence has continued for half a century and remains as robust as ever . As Lin Ku-fang-chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at Fokuang University 's College of Humanities and himself a Taida grad ( in archeology ) - reminds us , " The importance of National Taiwan University is not in that today it still has the highest average test scores among incoming freshmen of any school in the country , nor that it enjoys political influence and gets huge amounts of money from the government .  
" Although you could n't really say that the number of contracts actually signed is huge , we 're setting ourselves up for the future as a kind of consultant , helping integrate and strengthen each individual client according to their respective distribution weaknesses , " says Choice Group vice-chairman Jimmy Cheng . Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another . In today 's Taiwan , where there is still plenty of room for improvement in democratic institutions and where there still exist great differences on the question of national identity , both sides must proceed cautiously . Only in this way will they truly be able to seize the moment and usher in real political reform and a deepening of the democratic process .  
Will the evolution of food serve as a metaphor for the whole relationship ? Recently all the major political parties in Taiwan have been at war over the issue of public referenda , amidst dark hints from the United States and overt threats from the PRC . One can not help but sigh . When we were small , " recovering the mainland " was the unquestionable mission of the nation , and " pacifism " was a betrayal of the country and an evasion of moral responsibility .  
Yet no matter what political slogans may have declared , no matter how popular nostalgic soap operas about the mainland were or how authentic the cuisine remained , none of these things could overcome one basic fact-the two sides were separated for 40 years , during which there was no contact , families were separated , no one traveled to see the mainland 's famous scenery , and all we could know about what was going on behind the PRC 's " bamboo curtain " were shocking photographs of famine years .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
For Chiang Wei-shui personally , the 144 days that he spent in prison as a result of his two arrests connected with the incident provided him with an opportunity to do more reading and thinking . During this time he immersed himself in the theory of political and social movements and laid a solid foundation for the future development of such activities in Taiwan .  
Tang says that in college , most of his classmates were immersed in leftist thinking for a long time , and generally identified with the more " progressive " political party . But since the DPP won the presidential election in 2000 , the nature of politics has changed , and people have scattered among the various political parties . Policy has become more important than party identification , and different people work for different parties often just because they support some very specific policies of a given party .  
Thereafter , activists were absorbed into the mainstream political forces , and on both the political stage and in the business community they have played increasingly important roles . In these roles they have been given mixed reviews , being seen as " bold and idealistic " but also as naive " Boy Scouts . " The sixth and seventh generations-those aged 18-30 or so today , and thus the core group of interest to us here-are those of the age of mass university attendance .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
But it is worth noting that these young people are rather dissatisfied with Taiwan 's current political and economic situation , and most believe they are powerless to affect the overall picture . This survey also points up an important trend : among this generation with its extremely high proportion of highly educated people , education level is a significant variable when it comes to values and dreams . Compared with the past , the dreams and values of highly educated people are driving and guiding the direction of this generation as never before !  
Some people in political circles are worried that the " strategic ambiguity " that has characterized Taiwan-US-China relations over the years will be undermined and a premature showdown forced as a result of sentiments expressed in a referendum . The rapid rise of mainland China in recent years has brought it international political and economic power that can not be ignored . If the US leans toward the PRC , this may have unfortunate consequences for Taiwan .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake . The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
Lu pointed out that around the globe regional organization is a growing trend , and various continents have given rise to such organizations . Besides the European Union , with its comprehensive political and economic structure , the Organization of American States , the Sistema de la Integracion Centroamericana ( SICA ) , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , and the African Union have been formed one after another . However , it is a regrettable fact that Asia , where human civilization began , has yet to effectively organize itself .

The flagrant disregard for basic human rights and international humanitarian law is continuing to expand the range of human suffering , often placing fragile political and social structures in neighbouring regions and countries under unbearable pressure .  
The Treaty must lay down the legal and organizational prerequisites for achieving increased integration with a view to forming an economic , monetary and political union ;  
In these circumstances , the Russianspeaking population of Latvia is becoming an easy target for radical nationalist bureaucrats performing arbitrary and lawless acts with the secret but , in fact , direct connivance of the political leadership .  
The difficult socioeconomic conditions , exacerbated by deteriorating and fluctuating terms of trade , external indebtedness and political instability , which induce internal , regional and international migrations ;  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
Good governance should also promote economic development at local , regional and international levels , and mutual understanding between the political process and executive arm of the Government .  
It meets annually , at the Heads of Government level , to develop collective responses on a wide range of regional issues , including trade , economic development , civil aviation and maritime issues , telecommunications , energy and political and security matters .  
I also stressed that the international community would not invest additional human and material resources and risk lives in peacekeeping operations where political will did not make a substantive contribution to the peace process .  
Sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies , political stability , good governance , physical and institutional infrastructure and human resource development are a prerequisite for encouraging increased investment in Africa ;  
The Special Rapporteur 's claim that heads of cultural associations have been replaced by new heads who are members of the Arab Baath Socialist Party , is mere fabrication , with the obvious political ulterior motive of stirring up sectarian strife .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
Yes , the varied pattern of global cultural evolution may have been successful in the degree of international consensus on democracy as a better political system and free enterprise as a preferable or more effective economic approach .  
Most developing countries had implemented economic reforms on the advice of the developed countries and international financial institutions , but at great social and political cost .  
The economic , social and political situation in Africa had continued to deteriorate , and the international community had been incapable of halting the continent 's increasing marginalization and impoverishment .  
The cooperation currently being developed at the international level in the political and economic fields could only be effective if accompanies by strengthened international policies and actions in regard to social matters .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
The ultimate protection , however , lay in the legitimate exercise of Chamorro selfdetermination and the subsequent structuring of a political status conducive to their cultural survival and entry into the modern world in their own right .  
It stated that a people 's democracy would be built in the political , social , economic and cultural spheres that took account of traditional structures and aimed at a subsequent transition to socialism .  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) has been impeded by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , mainly at the local level , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
While specific civil and political rights standards were more or less capable of universal application , that could not be said for economic , social and cultural rights .  
In the interests of social and economic development at the global level , the international community must not forget the victims , once it had addressed the urgent political dimensions of such conflict .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
It underlined that all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , were universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  
International justice required independence from the decisions of political organs ; in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
The concept of security in the postcoldwar period was becoming more complex ; in addition to political security , it also included economic , environmental , social and scientific and technological security .  
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to a political , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , equality , respect , mutual responsibility and cooperation .  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
As poverty was both a material and an immaterial disadvantage , the aim should be to raise income and to promote the development of the full potential of the individual and the participation of the underprivileged in social , political and economic decisions .  
The most vulnerable groups children , women , the elderly and the disabled were paying the highest price for shortsighted economic policies , political blunders , war and serious violations of human rights .  
The international economic situation was such that the efforts made by the developing countries to develop longterm development strategies and lay down sound economic foundations were doomed to failure , thereby exacerbating political tensions .  
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .  
On the political and economic levels , the world continued to be divided into rich countries and poor countries , a polarization which seriously threatened human survival and the maintenance of security and peace .  
An alarming trend was emerging whereby the developed countries were defending civil and political rights , whereas the advocacy of the right to development was being left exclusively to the developing countries .  
Although the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights might be expensive and difficult , they should be promoted on an equal basis with civil and political rights .  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
The historical perspective and the social , cultural and political reality of Namibia prior to independence had played a major role in shaping its Constitution .  
Hungary strongly condemned the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iraq , where the Government was implicated in summary executions , political killings , systematic torture and the repression of ethnic and religious minorities .  
" Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
When combined with the prevailing culture and political calculation , the cult of performance and the cult of instant satisfaction make it difficult to sustain the constant and patient efforts that are needed for development and social progress .  
Noting with grave concern the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria and Israel ,  
Requests once again the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all humanitarian , material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly independent and emerging States so as to enable them to consolidate their political independence and achieve genuine economic independence ;  
Condemns the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between the racist regime and Israel ;  
A refugee , the Chairman maintained , was the helpless victim of the breakdown of the social contract and blatant evidence of political or diplomatic failure at the regional or international level .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
Considers that an international tribunal with general jurisdiction should be established urgently to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation , imprisonment , torture , rape , persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds and other inhumane acts directed against any civilian population , and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 thereto ;  
The European Union , as it has already stated on previous occasions , particularly in the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations , attaches the greatest political importance to the need to find a solution to the Organization 's financial crisis in order to establish a solid , permanent financial base for the Organization , thus enabling the United Nations to carry out all the mandates entrusted to it .  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
As the international community is aware , the Agreement signed at Chapultepec , Mexico , in January 1992 put an end to the armed conflict in El Salvador , marking the conclusion of the first phase of the peace process but the beginning of a complex and difficult period of transition during which the commitments made served as the framework for a developing political , economic and social process , which we are convinced will culminate in the consolidation of democracy . 
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
This is equally true in the economic and social sphere , and with regard to the constant modernization and honing of democratic institutions , governance , control of the exercise of political power , full and absolute respect for human rights and the daily exercise of such rights and obligations on the part both of those who govern and of those who are governed .  
New democracies virtually everywhere are confronting the common challenge of ensuring the peaceful processes of political transformation , the establishment and consolidation of internal democratic institutions and norms , and structural readjustment accompanied by socially oriented economic transformations backed up by a system of measures and guarantees for social justice in society .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
We feel political and economical closeness to the West , and we are aware of the unique historical opportunity to join the prosperous union of democratic European countries .  
While the United Nations can not realistically manage all the crises occurring world wide , because of its unique role and responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security , it should seek to strengthen global political consensus on the principles of the Charter , assist , through its preventive capacity , in the formulation of regional strategies and efforts and take decisive action when regional or global security is seriously challenged .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
This is what strikes me , as I now appear for the first time before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf of a country such as mine a country with a modest economy , a small population , a territory that is medium-sized but which , owing to its excellent geographical situation , developed more than others ; a culture of social freedom , of mixed races and of political independence , achieved by means of an epic struggle , not only for itself but for all of its American neighbours . 
Not so much economic or political as ethical in nature , this crisis has weakened our institutions and undermined our financial system , the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of our gross national product and has attracted the not-always-understanding attention of international opinion . 
However , throughout the entire history of the Asian continent , instability and protracted regional conflicts have often , unfortunately , constituted the political background , and this has significantly complicated the solution of problems of internal development .  
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .  
As regards international economic and social cooperation , this too requires the existence of the political will , especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries , to create an equitable global economic environment that may contribute to the achievement of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
Moreover , with a view to building a peaceful , prosperous and modern nation , my Government has formulated and is pursuing clear objectives in the political , economic and social spheres .  
The developments during the past year relating to the Framework Convention on Climate Change have to some extent been encouraging , but the process still suffers greatly from the strong political and economic forces that obscure the Convention 's clearly stated objective : the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at safe levels .  
This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
This remains a major preoccupation , as events since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil conflicts and political instability in many countries , particularly in the developing world , have become endemic , with grave consequences for international peace and security . 
The need to stabilize the political situation in that country is strictly linked to the future prospects of the ongoing political stabilization in neighbouring Rwanda , where mankind has recently witnessed horrible crimes and the untold suffering of innocent civilians . 
Years of apartheid rule have bequeathed the overwhelming majority black population with a heavy legacy of poverty , social disintegration and political cleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities .  
We are a nation deeply committed to the proper functioning of democratic institutions , having attained a commendable political stability in our continent 's community of nations .  
At the recent Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing , the international community recognized the crucial role that women play in the development process and acknowledged that effective international cooperation for development will remain an elusive goal unless women can participate fully in the political , economic and social life of their respective societies . 
Despite this solemn commitment , some of those involved in political life , manipulated from abroad , are trying desperately to hoodwink national and international public opinion by saying that the Government are responsible for delaying the votes .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
The opposition to a strong and dynamic United Nations is political and profoundly ideological , and is largely concentrated in a few States whose establishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in which their domestic and global policies can be challenged or trimmed .  But the United Nations exists for all humankind , not just a handful of Member States representing a small minority of the world 's population . . . .  
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
Philip ( Solomon Islands ) : It is indeed fitting that this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly is being presided over by Mr . Freitas do Amara of Portugal , a distinguished teacher of law , an experienced parliamentarian , and the founder of one of the major political parties that helped to return vibrant democracy to his homeland .  
Today , when the international political situation opens up vast prospects for frequent recourse to the jurisdiction of the Court , anachronisms , conservative tendencies and all kinds of interests unfortunately prevent the total flourishing of an international judicial order binding on all , beginning with the most powerful among us . 
In 1987 , when our Governments decided to take up the historic challenge of achieving a political solution to the Central American crisis through the peace process adopted in Esquipulas II , they also recognized that peace and development were inseparable and that the consolidation of democracy presupposed the establishment of a system of well-being and economic and social justice , which is indispensable in helping to overcome the deep-rooted causes of that conflict .  
Peace can only be maintained by observing such norms governing international relations as respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , and by establishing , in accordance with the United Nations Charter , a new international political and economic order that is just and fair .  
At the same time , though , there is a growing danger of armed conflicts breaking out because of continuing economic , political , territorial , ethnic , religious and other imbalances in relations between States .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
The so-called underdeveloped world is not calling on the international community for hand-outs or privileged positions in trade ; all it is asking for is fair , transparent and egalitarian treatment , with terms of trade that are not distorted by political pricing , hidden subsidies and dumping practices whose persistence in international trade causes real havoc in the economies of a large number of nations .  
The European Union is a common project for living together in peace , for shared political , economic and social values , which has enabled Europe to re-emerge from its ashes and to establish itself as a focal point of stability and progress in the international arena . 
None the less , the United Nations attained important and substantial achievements , outstanding among which were its significant contributions to avoiding another world war with unimaginable consequences , eliminating colonialism and racial discrimination , encouraging the codification of international law , strengthening the international system of human rights protection and promoting international cooperation for the improvement of the political , economic and social conditions of our peoples .  
The cold war is over , the geopolitical map has been radically altered , a worldwide democratization process has emerged , cooperation has replaced confrontation and a globalization process has begun in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres .  
In fact , many are unprepared to accept that human beings and nations are entitled to move steadily upward on economic , social , political and cultural trajectories which will provide genuine equality . 
Indeed , the widespread desire to bring uniformity to international society in political and institutional terms , on the one hand , and economic and social terms , on the other , has led to an imbalance every bit as dramatic as the imbalance not so long ago when the world was bipolar .  
Fifty years ago , in the aftermath of the Second World War , the international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , resolved at San Francisco to create an Organization that would establish the political , economic and social conditions for a new and lasting peace .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
At that time , the United Nations will have to play an active and decisive role so as to maintain the social , economic and political balance among the nations that make it up , with the understanding that all have the same rights and obligations now that we are enjoying a relative peace and that titanic efforts are under way to resolve the conflicts that persist .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
They have understood that democratization is a long-term undertaking , one that must be based on the historical , social and cultural realities of a country if it is to be effective and promote political stability , economic development and social justice .  
Far from accepting this situation as our fated lot and aware that we must rely on our own efforts , this year the African countries adopted , in Egypt , the Cairo Programme of Action , which aims at ensuring the immediate relaunching of Africa 's economic and social development through political and economic reforms and a global and coherent strategy .  
History is replete with instances of youth frustration militating against development and social progress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing political and social institutions were either unwilling or unable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to youth problems and aspirations . 
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Over the years this call , addressed to a world undergoing continuous and rapid change , has not ceased to be heard , even if the voice has sometimes been muted by political and economic circumstances , by wars and calamities , by social movements , and by walls destroyed or raised .  
Riera Escudero ( Paraguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Republic of Paraguay , which has a long history of authoritarian Governments , has enjoyed full civil and political freedoms for more than six years now , as part of a democratic process which , slowly but surely , is being consolidated and strengthened , with the consensus of a noble , peace-loving and hard-working people that makes daily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its children . 
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
The poverty alleviation programme aims to enable every Malawian to have access to basic necessities and to be able to develop and exploit his or her full potential to lead a productive , dignified and creative life through social , economic and political empowerment .  
To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and , at the same time , to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural , social , economic and political reality .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .  
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
There is extraordinary cooperation on the part of States , other political entities and non-governmental organizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern of the United Nations organs ; in the burgeoning , multidimensional sphere of sustainable development ; in the territory where humane concerns and values , social ordering and cultural norms coalesce ; and in the field of peace-keeping , of providing States and peoples with security from violence and disorder .  
However , the lack of political will to suppress aggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with United Nations decisions , coupled with the unreasonable , immoral and legally baseless insistence by some on extending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia to the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the Serbs that they can continue with impunity their murder , destruction , aggression , ethnic cleansing and genocide .  
Regarding the organization and the direction of the Olympic Movement , a pivotal role is being played by His Excellency Mr . Juan Antonio Samaranch , who , through his policy of engaging in personal contacts and through the prestige which he enjoys throughout the world , within the most varied of political and diplomatic circles , has succeeded in making the Olympic Movement an interlocutor of the most representative and the largest world forum , the United Nations .  
Georgiades ( Cyprus ) : In a world faced with unabated turmoil , the ancient Greek spirit that gave rise to the Olympian ideal of athletic achievement and excellence transcends the cultural and political boundaries that divide human communities .  
The world community must continue to afford effective assistance to the Central American countries in averting new outbreaks of tension , in ensuring that the processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State structures , in strengthening the climate of political tolerance , in the strict observance of human rights , and in their economic recovery .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus . 
On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
Well-structured , effective , mutually independent and collaborative State institutions , an equitable political system , a harmonized legal system , overall security and economic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic State .  
The United Nations agencies involved in the entire range of processes covered under this omnibus goal should ensure that their activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular the sovereign equality and political independence of States , territorial integrity , and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State .  
Fifthly , sharing democratic values is of crucial importance for the political , economic and social processes in national societies , as well as for international peace and security .  
As we see it , the value of democratization is primarily that , having become an integral part of the internal political processes , it provides a basis for reconciliation , tolerance , full application of , respect for and defence of human rights , and the development of social practices based on the peaceful search for constructive solutions .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
We do recognize also that there are some legitimate considerations that have to be addressed in the negotiating process , including internal territorial delineations and means to rebuild the confidence of the population in the political processes and mechanisms that are designed to secure respect for human rights .  
These variable criteria are subject to historical , human , demographic , political , economic , territorial and other changes .  
Its contribution to disseminating information about the importance of free and fair elections , the participation of women and men as equal partners in social , economic and political life , and the protection and promotion of human rights and individual freedom has undoubtedly been singular .  
The changes of the last decade in economic and political conditions and new consensuses reached during the recent series of conferences offer a unique opportunity to develop an intensified , strengthened and more realistic approach to such cooperation , but the opportunity may go to waste if we fail to shape a more efficient , creative and forward-looking United Nations . 
As is recalled in resolution 48 / 162 , the General Assembly is the main forum where Governments pursue the development dialogue in a political context , oriented towards taking an integrated view of matters pertaining to the economic , social and related fields in order to build and deepen the political understanding required for enhanced international development cooperation . 
In our view , a speedy recovery from the critical situation of depleting resources requires , first and foremost , that the developed countries honour their political commitments by increasing substantially their contributions to resources on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , especially their official development assistance . 
While my delegation is fully committed to participating actively and constructively in future consultations on new modalities for funding for operational activities for development , we believe that what is now crucial is the political will and determination of all parties on how best to arrest the downward spiral of resources for development . 
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
At the social level it is indisputable that intolerance of racial , religious , ethnic , language and gender differences is exploited by groups which seek to attain or maintain economic and political power over others .  
Elsewhere in the draft resolution 's operative part , the Secretary-General is requested to continue to deploy his efforts towards strengthening cooperation and coordination between the two organizations and their specialized agencies in order for the two organizations to enhance their capacity to serve their mutual interests in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields .  
The agenda of the latest meeting between the two organizations included a number of issues of paramount importance , including political questions , such as the maintenance of international peace and security ; humanitarian issues , such as mine clearance ; and such economic and social issues as desertification control , protection of the environment , sustainable development , narcotics control and crime prevention .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
This means that nothing could be done in the absence of the political will of States that bear the responsibility of dispelling doubts and remedying the disaffection that is noticeable today vis - - vis the United Nations by giving true meaning to the Organization 's invaluable and multifarious contributions towards the promotion of an international society that is more just , better organized and better structured .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
El Salvador experienced one of the most severe , complex and difficult crises in Central America in the second half of this century in the 1980s , to be precise , when a military and political conflict began and went on for 12 years .  
In considering the continuum with respect to systematic breakdowns or societal implosion , the matter becomes more complicated in the sense that the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance in contributing to rebuilding a society decimated by conflict depends on how effectively the underlying political problems of such emergencies have been addressed .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
Regional cooperation is a goal which we all seek , but it must be the result of the achievement of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , including the resolution of the final status issues , as provided for in the Declaration of Principles . We believe that this goal should be reached gradually , moving parallel to the political developments achieved and supporting them , not preceding them .  
We are convinced that the adoption of this balanced draft resolution will give political support to efforts to establish a post-confrontational Middle East , based on broad international cooperation and the accelerated economic development of that region .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
The challenge the international community now faces is threefold : to ensure that recent positive developments do not founder for lack of economic and political support , to nurture progress on the other bilateral tracks of negotiations to match that achieved between Israel and the PLO and to prevent acts of violence and terrorism by extremist groups that seek to endanger the peace process and threaten to drive the Middle East back into conflict and suffering .  
I wish to express the hope that the practical implementation of this document will contribute to the continuation of the negotiating process towards the final settlement of the problem by political means and to the establishment of lasting peace and mutual understanding in the Middle East , and will serve the cause of the Palestinian people 's exercise of its right to national self-determination through the creation of an independent State of Palestine .  
It is therefore essential that the international community defend the peace process , give it political , economic and moral support and encourage the parties concerned to work for a genuine peace based on mutual understanding , cooperation , security , dignity and respect for the legitimate rights of all .  
It also urged the international community to increase the financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial to regenerate economic growth and sustainable development , and to provide effective support to political reforms and help cushion their adverse social consequences .  
These reports have been at once analytical , comprehensive and insightful inasmuch as they have exposed the dark cloud hanging over much of Africa , threatening to drag the continent deeper into economic ruin , social decay and political instability .  
As regards Africa , the steady deterioration of economic and social conditions can only contribute to confirming the pessimistic views regarding a continent that has been marginalized and left to its own devices to deal with the many political , economic , social and ecological crises besetting it .  
We should resolutely address the endogenous impediments to growth and development , which include political instability , ineffective and inefficient utilization of both human and material resources , inappropriate priority-setting , ill-conceived policy orientation and ill-designed and impractical implementation mechanisms . 
This is so for a number of reasons : first , its long-standing relationship with the countries in and around the conflict area and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced and durable political settlement ; secondly , because of the experience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with a long record of practical work in the area ; thirdly , acquired knowledge and expertise in working with international financial institutions in implementing programmes for reconstruction and development .  
Building upon political and economic stability , ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed that contribute to consolidating the opening of our economies , the transparency of our markets , and the growth of commercial exchange with other regions in short , the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a better future for our peoples .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
Therefore , in that regard , my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee , given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee 's work is progressive , innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social , economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration , and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
A common agreement was reached in Copenhagen aimed at creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment , based on democracy , full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , equality between men and women , the elimination of all forms of discrimination , solidarity , transparent and accountable governance and administration , and the encouragement of partnership with free and representative organizations of civil society . 
This is an imaginative , promotive , contemporary and fair State that respects economic , political and social balance and makes room for individual and collective creativity in society .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
Fernandes ( India ) : At the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen , our leaders committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
My delegation expresses the hope that this debate may reflect the tone of an international community resolved to fight for its future , a community that in the midst of its needs and aspirations has confidence that the United Nations can faithfully carry out the mandate of the World Summit for Social Development , which , as this General Assembly has already stated , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative for humankind .  
To deal with these problems is a political , social and ethical imperative for us all that requires a collective approach , both national and international , on the basis of a new understanding of cooperation , equality , tolerance and respect for the customs and beliefs of different societies .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
This is because we are fully aware , as the Summit itself has underscored , that nothing short of a renewed and massive political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
The priority objectives of guaranteeing the social protection of the individual , promoting his social integration and guaranteeing social peace and harmony can not be attained without a firm political will to invest at the national level , but also at the international level , in the well-being of all .  
Through these actions it aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
Consensus in Beijing revolved around these basic principles : violence against women must stop ; girls must be valued equally with boys ; women must have equal access to education , health care and the levers of economic and political power ; family responsibilities should be shared ; and the human rights of women are an integral component of all human rights they are neither separable nor different from those of men .  
The European Union considers that the presidential elections scheduled for 17 December should reinforce the achievements already made and should provide an example of harmony and tolerance , so that the entire population of Haiti can attain genuine national reconciliation and lay the foundations for the political , economic and social reconstruction of their country .  
In this context , the continued support of the United Nations system and the international community , which is recognized in this draft resolution , will be critical in providing the people of Haiti with a second chance to secure a democratic future , in which their political and development aspirations can be fulfilled .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Rowe ( Australia ) : All discussions of the problem of land-mines are redolent with statistics and verbal images of a profoundly shocking and disturbing nature , invoking numbers of civilians , including children , killed or injured , the extent of their injuries , the cost of rehabilitation , the effect on their livelihoods and their prospects for family life , the acreage of arable land laid waste and the incalculable debilitating social and political effects of living with a constant source of terror .  
These figures highlight the fact that this is not a static problem ; it is a recurring humanitarian crisis that is worsening day by day and requires greater efforts and political will if we are to put an end to this inhumane situation in which human lives are destroyed , as is the environment as a whole .  
Without a realistic and sufficiently operational vision for dealing with the basic security and political issues in the region , the OSCE will not be able to play an active role and will react to emerging situations in a random and not necessarily successful manner .  
As a political non-governmental organization , we are active in observing troublesome electoral processes , campaigning for political and civil rights where necessary and supporting those causes that we consider fair in international politics .  
We urge the Special Committee to take very careful note of the documentation presented to it by Amnesty International , by other human rights groups and by East Timorese in exile , which details the ongoing human rights abuses in East Timor , such as torture , involuntary disappearances , maltreatment of political prisoners and extrajudicial killings .  The recent killing by the Indonesian military of 6 civilians in Liquica is but one example .  
Of more far-ranging significance is the fact that the issue of political status has now been dubbed too complicated , too confusing and too separated from the everyday issues of economic , political and social life to be of any moment to the ordinary resident of the Territory .  
Although we firmly believe that action towards securing this new international legal instrument banning nuclear-test explosions in a verifiable and comprehensive manner is well advanced and irreversible , important political decisions on key treaty elements have yet to be taken in order to meet the deadline set by the NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The Secretary-General of the United Nations , in his report on the three Regional Centres , contained in document A / 50 / 380 of 25 August 1995 , recognized and strongly emphasized the importance of the role that such institutions can play in drawing up , at the regional level , confidence-building measures , measures to strengthen social and political stability and the security of States , and to help in the limitation and neutralization of existing arsenals .  
The establishment of a conceptual link between disarmament and development by giving an impetus to more accelerated progress on the issues of global development will strengthen the roots of international peace and security and preserve the spirit of understanding , constructive cooperation and genuine political goodwill which are essential for the building of a better and more secure world . 
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance and respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted at youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Another constraint is the lack of sustained political commitment to , and support of , the process of enhanced productivity , economic growth and social equity in rural areas .  This is often caused by a lack of long-term national energy strategies with the objective of balanced national economic and social development .  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
Although some representatives stated that the participation of women in decision-making bodies at the national level had increased , many representatives stressed that women were still far from reaching equal power and that more radical policy interventions and strong political will would be required to bring about immediate changes , including changes in the structure and cultures of institutions .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international , political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
Furthermore , the exercise of such rights was not possible in the absence of political freedom , and their protection required States to adopt democratic practices , practices which must inevitably bring benefits since people who were free to think , exchange ideas and invest their own energies and capital would be able to contribute more to economic and social development than people stunted by repression .  
The United States urged China to take further steps to improve the human rights situation in its territory by observing international norms , preserving Tibet 's unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage and releasing persons jailed solely for expressing political beliefs .  
In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Algeria was aware that the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles were primarily the responsibility of Governments , and it assigned a prominent place to those rights and principles in its project for the construction of a modern State based on republican principles and on the alternation of political power .  
Costa Rica was convinced that the fullest possible utilization of the existing machinery for the protection of human rights , which was now better coordinated thanks to the actions of the High Commissioner - together with the political will of States , played a crucial role in achieving the goals set out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
Programmes to support and strengthen equal employment opportunities and equitable remuneration for women in the formal and informal sectors with adequate economic , political and social support systems and services , including child care , particularly day-care facilities and parental leave , and equal access to credit , land and other natural resources ;  
The full and equal , participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
The Turkish Grand National Assembly has been closing its eyes to the numerous examples of flagrant violation of human rights in Turkey itself , particularly to the internal war of the Turkish Army against the Kurds , who are denied fundamental national and political rights .  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) had to be drastically reduced , the humanitarian situation worsened , and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOMOG ) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country . 
We consider that the countries that are participating in ECOWAS and in the ECOWAS Military Observer Group ( ECOMOG ) are playing a key role in preventing Liberia from sliding into complete military and political anarchy and in preventing the breakup of the country which , without any doubt , would have serious negative consequences for the entire region .  
She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .  
Criticisms of the concept of carrying capacity have pointed out that it does not adequately account for the potential impact of technological change , aspirations for higher standards of living , possibilities for and effects of international trade , and institutional , social , economic and political constraints on land use and production . 
At the same time , on the domestic front , Turkey is not prepared even to discuss a multi-ethnic and multicultural concept , hence flagrantly and on a large-scale basis violating the human , national and political rights of the Kurds , waging a real internal war against them .  
On this issue , it is important that we be clear about the goals of the sanctions imposed , the need for a timely agreement on precise conditions and machinery for lifting them once they have fulfilled their purpose , the inadmissibility of tightening sanctions if that would hinder the process of a political settlement , and the vital need to consider humanitarian factors .  
They underscore in our view a basic need for the United Nations to be responsive to the demands of a changing international political landscape whose form and content are yet to be fully assessed and fully determined so that the continuing legitimacy of the United Nations can be assured .  
The full and equal participation of women in civil , cultural , economic , political , and social life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community . "  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
In order to contribute to the creation of an environment of mutual trust , cooperation and partnership and to assist the political process for a bicommunal and bizonal federal solution , we propose the setting up of a transitional joint body under the co-chairmanship of the leaders of the two communities ( a ) to look into the daily matters and issues of common concern to the two sides ; ( b ) to develop joint projects to deal with such common concerns and issues ; and ( c ) to implement such projects .  
In view of the above , the Turkish Cypriot side wishes to announce , here and now , that it is prepared to discuss the subject of European Union membership of the federal Republic within the framework foreseen in the " set of ideas " , as soon as an agreement is reached on a bicommunal and bizonal federal solution and the equal political status of both communities is respected .  
Reiterates its belief that as the United Nations , the embodiment of multilateralism , is uniquely placed to promote a more just , equitable , prosperous and secure world order , it should be strengthened to reflect current political and economic realities and to contribute to enhancing the common welfare on the basis of international cooperation , mutual respect and global partnership ;  
Reiterates its belief that as the United Nations , the embodiment of multilateralism , is uniquely placed to promote a more just , equitable , prosperous and secure world order , it should be strengthened to reflect current political and economic realities and to contribute to enhancing the common welfare on the basis of international cooperation , mutual respect and global partnership ;  
Either of these modalities , together with strong political support for operational activities , could provide a better system with more assured , predictable and increased levels of resources to meet the needs of developing countries .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
Noting with satisfaction the holding of free and democratic elections in El Salvador , the progress made towards fulfilment of the outstanding commitments assumed under the Peace Agreement , the political will consistently expressed by the signatories thereto and the support of the various Salvadorian political forces for accelerating the resolution of crucial outstanding issues , which is essential to promote reconciliation and maintain and consolidate peace in El Salvador ,  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
That Department has since passed through successive phases of restructuring and is now organized to follow political developments worldwide , so that it can provide early warning of impending conflicts and analyse possibilities for preventive action by the United Nations , as well as for action to help resolve existing conflicts .  
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
Each of these from the most powerful to the least , from the leaders of Mozambique 's political parties to the poorest citizen walking to a ballot box in the countryside , from senior officials in this grand building to the youngest private in a blue helmet who guarded a lonely road-crossing in the bush all can be proud of what their work together has accomplished .  
Many crucial steps remain to be taken to achieve the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of Haiti and to provide for the Haitian people a peaceful and stable future based on democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law and on economic and social justice .  
Serious violations of human rights and the mass exodus of a considerable portion of the Haitian population for political or economic reasons called for prompt and resolute action on the part of the international community , the United Nations and the Organization of American States .  
She assured members of the Committee that , in spite of the current economic and political crisis in the Russian Federation and the sharp reduction in the capacity of the State to achieve the goals set by the Convention , the Government remained dedicated to the goals of women 's advancement and the elimination of discrimination against them and would continue to take measures directed at alleviating the negative impact of transformation on women and improving their economic and social position .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
It also declared that the full and equal participation of women in civil , cultural , economic , political and social life at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex , were priority objectives of the international community .  
We , Heads of State and Government , are committed to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development based on human dignity , human rights , equality , respect , peace , democracy , mutual responsibility and cooperation , and full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
Note : The words in brackets and in bold are pending ; a proposed alternative was to retain only the words " developing countries " and to insert a new sentence : " Radical political , social and economic changes in the countries with economies in transition have been accompanied by a severe deterioration of their economic and social situation . "  
We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
Recognize and respect cultural , ethnic and religious diversity , and promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities ; and take measures to facilitate their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and social development in their country ;  
Promote changes in attitudes , structures , policies , laws and practices in order to eliminate all obstacles to human dignity , equality and equity in the family and society ; and promote full and equal participation of urban and rural women , and women with disabilities , in social , economic and political life , including in the formulation , implementation and follow-up of public policies and programmes ;  
People living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and participation in all aspects of political , economic and social life , and in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them and thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development .  
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , both at the national and the international level , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food as well as physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
Supporting by legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote the interests of the groups concerned and become involved in local and national , economic , social and political decision-making that guides society as a whole ;  
Nothing short of a renewed and massive political will , at the national and international level , to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
With regard to part I of the report , dealing with the country 's general , economic , political and legal framework , she noted that although Bolivia had historically faced problems of extreme poverty and instability , in its first decade of democracy progress had been made towards the macroeconomic stability that was essential to social policy .  
Unless a significantly more effective approach to land resources management is adopted now , a possible scenario could include a large increase in poverty , hunger , social instability , war , greatly increased migration from resource-poor environments to more favourable ones , together with almost complete destruction of the remaining natural environment and possibly modifications to the world 's climate which will cause social upheaval and political unrest on a vast scale .  
Urges the international community to increase financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial in order to regenerate the growth and sustainable development of the African economies , to provide effective support to the political and economic reforms in which many African countries are now engaged and to help cushion adverse social consequences ;  
It is recommended that the reports should not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years but should also include information indicating how these legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
Ms . BARYARUHA ( Uganda ) said that prior to 1986 , Uganda 's human rights record had been among the worst in the world , and the country was still recovering from more than two decades of political instability and civil strife which had brought about social disintegration and a total breakdown of infrastructure .  
Promoting effective enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and access to existing social protection and public services by , in particular , through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of all relevant human rights instruments ;  
At a time when national security should be seen more and more in the context of military and political stability at the regional and international levels , the time had come to apply the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
It decided to transmit to the Economic and Social Council a draft resolution on the contribution of comprehensive national policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems ( draft decision III ) .  
The senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Uzbekistan , supporting the efforts of the leadership of Tajikistan to carry out democratic reforms , stressed the special importance in that connection of the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the need for them to be held in accordance with democratic norms , on a multiparty basis , and to ensure the widest possible participation of the various political forces .  
It needs to be emphasized that a peaceful settlement of the Angolan civil conflict is not only essential for the people of Angola themselves , but also of major importance to political stability and economic development in southern Africa as a whole .  
My delegation is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his excellent report ( S / 1995 / 97 ) , dated 1 February 1995 , which has provided valuable insights into the continuing problems in Angola in the political , military , civil and humanitarian spheres .  
We can , however , agree to the six-month initial period proposed in the current draft , but only on the understanding that the United Nations is not about to terminate its presence in Angola after only six months , rather , that it is prepared to undertake additional periods of extension , based on actual performance , to enable the political process to take root .  
Although the status quo in Angola is a cause for optimism that peace will be restored to that country , it is vital that the two parties continue to demonstrate the political will and the commitment necessary for the achievement of peace and national reconciliation through strict and timely compliance with the Acordos de Paz , the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions , in the interests of durable peace , security and economic and social development in their country .  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .  
Desiring , in the interests of their citizens , to ensure equal conditions for their residence in the territories of the two Parties and , in this connection , wishing to offer the citizens of one Party who reside permanently in the territory of the other Party a legal status that is as close as possible to the legal status of the citizens of the other Party , in particular as regards civil , political , social , economic , labour , cultural and other rights ,  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
The United States has been alarmed and disconcerted by the political stability enjoyed by the Libyan people , by the fact that it rallies to its leadership and by its steadfast character despite the iniquitous economic embargo imposed as a result of the hegemony of certain major Powers in the Security Council , chiefly the United States of America itself .  
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The list of issues it prepared in considering States parties ' reports always included questions concerning the participation of women in political , economic , social and cultural life and male and female enrolment in schools and universities .  
Whenever women have joined decision-making bodies in sufficient numbers , they have created a more collaborative atmosphere , characterized by mutual respect , independent of prevailing political differences , and sought consensus .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
He noted that international justice required independence from the decisions of political organs , and that , in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
It was further stated that the political question of whether a country had perpetrated an act of aggression was in principle separate from the legal question of whether an individual from a particular country could be held responsible for the act and that the Court would be perfectly capable of taking note of an act of aggression without the Security Council having first determined it .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
In order to reverse this trend , the country must satisfy one major condition , a political condition : it must conduct free , transparent and democratic elections and take subsequent measures to establish a constitutional State .  
Recognizing that the growing threat of organized crime , with its highly destabilizing and corrupting influence on fundamental social , economic and political institutions , represents a challenge demanding increased and more effective international cooperation ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Needless to say , the tragic events triggered by the military coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at during the night of 20-21 October 1993 can not be viewed in isolation ; they should be considered in the light of their historical , political , economic and social background .  
It was not possible to set up or put into operation the national state security council because those who were to be members had declined and the rebels came up against the unanimous condemnation and firm demands on the part of the political , moral , social and even military forces calling for a return to constitutional legality . 
The election on 29 June 1993 of a parliamentary majority representing FRODEBU , which gained 65 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly , made his victory over the previous regime complete and strengthened his claim , which was undoubtedly legitimate , to a more active role in the country 's political , economic , social and cultural life . 
Persons of all categories and walks of life and all ages - peasant farmers executives and militant members of political parties , government agents , medical and paramedical personnel , and lay and religious persons - were killed in atrocious ways in the bloodthirsty madness which caused the people of Burundi enormous suffering and which can not in any way be justified . 
Poverty is a multidimensional , complex situation that has economic , educational , social , political , cultural and technological dimensions .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .

Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
National implementation of international instruments : It was recognized that a gap exists between international instruments and implementation at the national level : the lack of effective implementation of international obligations is due to economic , social and political difficulties inherent in the transition process .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
Establish , consistent with data protection legislation , databases on women and their qualification for use in appointing women to senior decision-making and advisory positions , for dissemination to Governments , regional and international organizations and private enterprise , political parties and other relevant bodies .  
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
Based on a strong political commitment , create a national machinery , where it does not exist , and strengthen , as appropriate , existing national machineries , for the advancement of women at the highest possible level of government ; it should have clearly defined mandates and authority ; critical elements would be adequate resources and the ability and competence to influence policy and formulate and review legislation .  
The Platform for Action reaffirms that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , as expressed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights .  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable are possible only through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .  
The Islamic State of Afghanistan would like to assure you that the freedom-loving people of Afghanistan do realize their prime national obligation to liberate the western parts of Afghanistan , including occupied Herat , and to force the Pakistani militia out of the area by a general and resolute armed struggle , in favour of the country 's political and administrative unity .  
Also at the sixth round , the two sides , without prejudice to their respective positions of principle regarding the political status of East Timor , began discussions on the substantive issues identified by me regarding possible avenues for a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution .  
The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .  
The 142 States present at the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Crime proclaimed their political will and strong determination , as well as their unequivocal commitment , to ensure the full and expeditious implementation of the Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , reflecting the urgency and priority attention attached to action against organized transnational crime .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
In most developing countries and countries in transition , however , various factors , ranging from lack of adequate resources to recent rapid political and economic developments and changes , have slowed down or inhibited the process of attaining a thorough understanding of the situation .  
It should also consider conditions that are conducive to the rise and growth of criminal organizations , such as social , economic and political factors , structural characteristics of organized crime , as well as organizational shortcomings in the control agencies .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
Building on the established consensus and taking full advantage of the present political climate , which is conducive to more meaningful international cooperation , States should specify the activities that need to be undertaken for implementation , agree on the pace of such implementation and devote their energies and undivided attention towards achieving the common goals identified in the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan .  
The imposition of coercive economic measures ignores such principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States , and violates international legal instruments with the intent of forcibly imposing the political will of the sending State and subverting the political , economic and social regime of the target State .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
The specific , defining feature of coercive economic measures is that of negative economic activities applied for political purposes , forming part of discriminatory or punitive interventionist policies .  
They range from alleged threats to the national security of the sender State and the alleged violation of agreed international norms and instruments by the target State , to expressions of dislike for specific domestic or foreign policies of the target State or more generally for the political and socio-economic system of the target State .  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from ten to seven , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
It was agreed that the Committee should be flexible and simply take note of the existence of national institutions , irrespective of the political or ideological regime under which they had been established , bearing in mind that they could be improved and that technical assistance could be provided to that end .  
Whatever the specific arrangements for the Assembly 's review , it is essential to ensure that its outcome contributes to maintaining the political momentum and visibility of the sustainable development agenda as well as to the broader discussion currently under way of the reform of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields and to discussions on the agenda for development and the coordinated follow-up of other major United Nations conferences .  
It is increasingly apparent that the world Organization finds itself working in a new communications age defined by rapidly changing political environments , equally swift technological developments , unprecedented budget pressures on major contributing countries , and the rising power and world-wide reach of the media .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
" We have promoted racial understanding , and sought to guarantee to everyone , without distinction as to race , colour , national or ethnic origin , the right to equality before the law in civil , political and economic rights .  
Structurally , racial discrimination through denial takes on insidious and subtle forms , and subsists as a vicious circle that only political will based on a clear and courageous facing of reality can break , by attacking the evil .

The international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , endeavoured at the San Francisco Conference , 50 years ago , to create an international Organization that would be able to prevent such calamities in the future by establishing the political , economic and social conditions for a new , more peaceful and safer world .  
We must assume the historic commitment to accept the challenge and to devote ourselves with enthusiasm to the shaping of a new world , which will do away with political , religious and racial intolerance , which will eliminate inequality and social backwardness , which will establish human fraternity and solidarity , a new world in which the beacon of freedom and democracy will light its path . 
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
But when the time comes to negotiate multilateral replenishments , additional multilateral resources are seen as coming at the expense of already stretched bilateral programmes , which are usually perceived to bring political benefits or to respond more closely to donor Government policies and priorities , since the donor itself is responsible for their supervision and control .  
Horrendous atrocities committed by the regular army of Croatia in Western Slavonia and Krajina which resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs , the looting and burning of Serb houses and the expulsion of about 500,000 of them from their ancestral homes , have proved that the main Croatian political goal is to establish an ethnically pure State .  
NULLIn its resolution 1995 / 52 of 3 March 1995 on the situation of human rights in Togo , the Commission , inter alia , welcomed the fact that Togo had set out on the road to democratic political change , and urged all Togolese to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections held in February 1994 and to ensure the effective functioning of the democratically elected parliament .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) was hampered by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
A positive scenario for rapprochement between the people , its Government and the political parties would be the definition , with broad civil participation , of a national development strategy for the medium and long term , to which the main political forces and the Government were committed .  
The study enjoys the guidance and advice of a group of eminent persons made up of individuals of international repute and integrity drawn from every geographic region and representing a wide diversity of political , religious and cultural backgrounds ; this group also acts as a public advocate .  
It should give participants access to a comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law enforcement , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills .  
NULLAs far as the internal situation in Burundi is concerned , the international community , which has so far played a positive role in preventing a wider conflict there , should continue to coordinate its efforts so that the message to the political leaders of Burundi is consistent and unanimous .  
We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts , to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world :  
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
In the aforesaid resolution , the General Assembly enumerated the High Commissioner 's responsibilities , which basically involve promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
" Accordingly , I would be most grateful to continue benefitting from the cooperation of your Excellency 's Government so that I may provide the General Assembly and the Commission with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights in Myanmar .  
" Keeping in mind the deadline for the submission of my interim report to the General Assembly ( September 1995 ) , a visit to Myanmar at the end of August may be the only opportunity to provide the international community with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights in Myanmar .  
" Accordingly , I would be most grateful to continue benefitting from the cooperation of your Excellency 's Government so that I may provide the Commission and the General Assembly with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil , and political rights in Myanmar in accordance with the provisions contained in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995 / 72 .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
NULLThe events described above , coupled with other political and military developments within the Republic of Croatia and the contiguous territories of the former Yugoslavia , as well as the frequently declared intention of the Croatian authorities to recover lost territories by other means if negotiations did not succeed , made it very difficult to resume meaningful negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion .  
Accordingly , special attention had been paid to strengthening the Organization 's capacity to deal with political and peace-keeping activities , reinforcing international and regional cooperation for development , enhancing support for human rights and humanitarian activities , and increasing internal oversight capacity .  
NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
In order to be included in the list of crimes in the draft Code , such infractions must correspond to the legal rules accepted by States , must be considered serious enough to be defined as crimes against the peace and security of mankind , and must refer to acts sufficiently identifiable to appear in a criminal text .  The matter should be dealt with only from a legal , not a political , perspective .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality , and we call upon the States of the world :  
In this context , it is worth mentioning that the changes taking place in Cuban society , principally in the economic sector , are creating a more conducive framework enabling the incipient movement of non-governmental organizations to reform Cuban civil society and to call for democratic rules in relations between society and the political authorities .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
We want to generate broad support for an improved global multilateral system , based upon a renewed political will of all Member States , and which draws on the energies and the commitment of independent organizations of civil society .  
It presented the eradication of poverty as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative ( Declaration , Commitment 2 ) and stressed that societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families , and the communities in which they live ( ibid . , para .  NULL  
Some claim to have been denied housing because they are not associated with successful political parties or because they were orphans , refugees or other disadvantaged people who returned to the city or town too late , or were too powerless , to secure access to free housing in premises abandoned by their former owners .  
Its closing consensus statement emphasized that media scrutiny of the exercise of political power was essential in a democratic society ; that all media laws should conform to international and constitutional standards ; and that journalists themselves have a duty to work to the highest professional standards .  
Turning to the report on the sources of finance for development at mid-decade ( A / 50 / 397 ) , he noted that the marked increases in private resource flows to Asia and Latin America , which had far exceeded official flows , reflected successful economic reforms and strengthened political confidence in those regions .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
In addition , the phenomenon of the caste system , which could be characterized as multiple apartheid , also must be addressed openly with a view to mitigating the suffering of millions of people living a life of bondage and discrimination which divided them into upper and lower echelons , segregated them and excluded them from the political , economic , social and cultural spheres of society . 
In his country , whose population reflected an ethnic mixture created by successive waves of migrants , his Government had systematically extended moral , political and material support to all peoples struggling against racial discrimination and apartheid .  
At a time when the United Nations is frequently faulted for not being equipped to deal with pressing challenges , we do well to recall the pivotal role of our world Organization and its agencies in spearheading efforts to secure equal access for women in all aspects of political , economic and social development .  
The United States legal system was an excellent example of a system based on laws that respected the basic civil and political rights of all individuals as a precondition for any society hoping to eliminate racial discrimination .  
Although the Turkish Cypriots now live free from Greek Cypriot harassment , oppression and terror , an inhuman embargo on their political , economic , social and cultural activity , imposed by the other side , continues .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic or designer drugs , has expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
After having undertaken a drastic policy of ethnic cleansing against Serbs , the Croatian authorities are already calling into question the Serbs ' right to be represented in Parliament , the Government , regional and other authorities because for that aspect of political life they do not fulfil the new condition of representing the prescribed 8 per cent in Croatia 's total population .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .  
It is clear that continuous Croatian threats , sabre rattling and persistent military provocations , as well as the deployment of great number of Croatian troops in the contiguous territories of Srem and Baranja , are not a way to overcome major outstanding problems in a satisfactory manner , i.e . , by peaceful means and through political negotiations .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
To the contrary , in the prevailing legal and political order in Iraq with life-threatening laws applicable to persons expressing any opposition to the Government , the conduct of the referendum made a mockery of relevant international human rights standards .  
The relative success of the Federation in protecting the international civil servant against gross political interference by one member country did not mean that , overnight , FICSA became a respected interlocutor of the management in the common system organizations .  
Article 14 , after all , prohibited " extreme economic or political coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act " , while article 13 stated clearly that such measures would not be permitted .  
Article 14 contained a list of prohibited countermeasures , including extreme coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State that had committed an internationally wrongful act , in other words measures of " intervention " .  
Noting that throughout all continents of the world a considerable number of societies have recently initiated bold , profound and daring attempts to achieve their social , political and economic goals through democratization and reforming their economies , pursuits that are deserving of the support and recognition of the international community ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
An international and independent court that was free from political pressures , established on a solid legal basis , accepted by all States to deal with well-defined crimes and capable of offering maximum guarantees to the defendants would provide , particularly where prevention was concerned , an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises which had adverse effects on entire peoples .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
Factors such as a strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates and have helped these countries to address some of the constraints facing their economies .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
A considerable momentum had been created and a commensurate political will was required to avoid protracted discussions and ensure that preparatory work was completed in time for a diplomatic conference in 1997 .  
It was pleased to note that , with the assistance and support of the international community and through the committed efforts of the Palestinian population , the Palestinian Authority had gradually established its administration and had taken a number of measures to ensure public order and to normalize Palestinian political , social , economic and cultural life , as well as to improve living conditions .  
A political consensus in the international community on the right to development was achieved for the first time at the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of the fundamental rights of the human person , the human person being the central subject of development .  
the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights " .  
" an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
It goes beyond the traditional conception of economic , social and cultural development by integrating in it the political dimension , basing it on popular participation and social justice , and focusing it on the human being , who is both its artisan and its chief beneficiary .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
Again , by giving a comprehensive definition of development and representing it to be a simultaneously economic , social , cultural and political process , the Declaration on the Right to Development reflects the international community 's will to revise national and international development strategies in the light of the disappointing experience of several United Nations Development Decades .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
Such reports might , for example , highlight the progress made in formulating new global development strategies or policies , international development cooperation , the promotion of popular participation and social justice and the simultaneous promotion of full respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Accordingly , full implementation and realization of the Declaration calls for a genuine democratization of international economic and political relations , a process that will negate the adverse consequences of the current process of globalization and foster a new climate of solidarity and international cooperation , in keeping with the growing interdependence observed world wide .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
The core of what the sponsors of the amendments thought was contained in amendment 7 , concerning the thirteenth preambular paragraph , which recognized " that the wishes of the peoples in the Territories with regard to their political status can be ascertained by referendums and other forms of popular consultation , including free and fair elections conducted by the Governments of the Territories . "  
He was well aware of the difficulties involved in proposing strategies to avert situations that would produce refugees , including the varying degree of international and internal consensus and of political commitment by the different parties , conflicting agendas and priorities , absence of media and public interest and donor fatigue .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The parties to those negotiations had agreed that permanent status issues should be covered at a later stage of the political process and they had recognized that some issues were so complex and sensitive that an interim period was needed before dealing with them . 
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
The Committee 's deliberations therefore had to take account of the fact that the Organization 's political mandate needed to be coupled with effective funding based on realistic considerations rather than short-term assessments that would further weaken emerging democracies or the struggling economies of developing countries .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
While the social reforms the Government had attempted and the stoicism of the population were helping to maintain a relative measure of political stability , Belarus ' social problems , if left unresolved , could become a matter of concern for the entire international community .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society , E . 75 .

also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .  
forthcoming Conference was part of the continuum of United Nations conferences that had begun at Rio , a continuum that was rewriting the economic , social and , perhaps , political agenda of the international community for the twenty-first century and was providing a more holistic and humane message about global problems and the solutions they required .  
was confident that the required support would be forthcoming and was optimistic about the outcome of the Conference , given the political support demonstrated thus far by national and local governments , organizations and people at all levels of society .  
States members of the European Union looked forward to the adoption at the Conference of a statement of principles and a global plan of action which promoted sustainable development through a participatory approach , reflected the positions of all involved in the negotiations and clearly set out the political messages on choices that must be made to meet the challenges at hand .  They reaffirmed their commitment to that objective .  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,

Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
erstwhile rivalry , sometimes violent , that had existed among the nine political parties formed during the struggle against the Soviet-backed Government , appeared to have changed into a conflict among three major armed groups : the Taliban , the forces controlled by General Dostum and his allies in the Supreme Coordination Council , and the government forces of President Rabbani .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy and stressing the fact that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable for reconstruction measures to have a lasting impact ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to increase its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
unsubstantiated and generalized charges of alleged violations of the human rights of the Albanian minority in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are aimed at shifting attention from the open tendencies of the extreme political leadership of the Albanian minority in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija towards the secession of this integral part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
In conclusion , he stressed that the profound political and economic changes that had occurred in recent years had confirmed that peace , economic growth , environmental protection , social justice and democracy were all closely interdependent .  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , the Prime Minister of Fiji had stressed the importance of working to redress some of the wrongs that history had wrought upon indigenous peoples and guaranteeing that external values and forces did not continue to impose political concessions , economic reforms and social changes that were not desired by indigenous people themselves .  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing the fact that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
All those activities required financial support on an orderly , stable and predictable basis , and it was therefore critical that donor countries demonstrate the political commitment to provide the funds promised and thereby to reach the objectives established during the triennial review .

Since the Commission had abdicated its mandated responsibilities and succumbed to political pressure , CCISUA considered that it was no longer viable , and therefore requested the General Assembly to place a moratorium on the consideration of pensionable remuneration issues , scheduled for 1996 , until the question of the consultative process had been resolved .  
While FICSA recognized that its proposal represented a radical change from the current structure of the Commission , it believed that minor changes would not be sufficient , since in its current form the Commission was too unresponsive , too political and too expensive .  
of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
The solution should also be a comprehensive one based on prevention , mitigation of damage to the environment and the search for sustainable solutions , which should be based on the political will to protect , defend and promote human rights , guarantee the participation of citizens in government and create an enabling environment for economic and social progress .  
Mr . AGGREY ( Ghana ) commended the excellent work carried out by the High Commissioner and the impartial manner in which he balanced issues relating to civil and political rights and questions concerning economic , social and cultural rights .  
Solutions to the problems faced by indigenous people must be worked out with their full participation and on the basis of full respect for their human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and identity .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 , of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Nations intervention should be confined to situations which posed an unquestionable threat to international peace and security and where Security Council decisions were based on the clearly expressed support of the majority of Member States , rather than on the political exigencies of a few States , no matter how powerful they might be .  
Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
included harmony among the various national groups and political stability based on the equal rights of all citizens , the unity of its multinational people and the resolution of all State issues through peaceful , democratic means .  
overwhelming majority of the world 's population lived in developing countries and for them , while political and civil rights were important , economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to subsistence and development , were paramount .  
She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
delegation was fully convinced that economic development alone was not enough to prevent humanitarian crises , and that political efforts were required to promote respect for human rights , the rule of law and responsible management of public affairs .  
PHAM ( Viet Nam ) said that Viet Nam had not been immune to the overwhelming refugee crisis which had affected the entire world and had worsened in recent years as a result of poverty , regional or internal armed conflicts , political , economic and social crises , violence and intolerance .  
Efforts to perfect Cuba 's political system and the rule of law had included the strengthening of constitutional rights and the enactment of a new election law providing for free , direct and secret parliamentary elections for the direct , popular nomination of candidates , without any need for political affiliation or party membership .  
considered that the main cause of the serious financial situation of the United Nations , which required a global and balanced solution , was the fact that certain Member States lacked the political will to discharge the binding financial obligations which they had assumed upon subscribing to the Charter .  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
In this context , the State seeks to modernize the kinds of measures taken by its public administration by gradually shifting its management and production actions towards a stronger public administration role in overseeing regulation and the proper functioning of economic mechanisms , in guaranteeing political and social stability and in protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society , in a spirit of social justice and rational solidarity .  
In this connection , it is appropriate to take into account the diversity of situations prevailing in each country in economic , social , cultural and political terms to appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative apparatus and then perhaps to suggest adjustments , since there can not be just one analytical criterion or just one model for good administration .  
Amid all these problems , the Government of National Unity installed on 19 July 1994 was faced with the daunting challenge of rehabilitating and rebuilding a war-ravaged economy , reviving the provision of basic social services to a traumatized population , coping with the wreckage of genocide , stabilizing a fragile political alliance , and consolidating internal peace and security , as well as warding off looming military threats from exiled soldiers of the former regime .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
The reform altered 65 of the Constitution 's 202 articles , with respect to individual rights ; the rights and responsibilities of and guarantees for the Nicaraguan people ; political and social rights ; the rights of the Nicaraguan family ; defence and the national economy ; agrarian reform and public finances ; education and culture ; the organization of the State ; municipal affairs ; and the Atlantic Coast communities . 
They have been declared entirely subordinate to the political Constitution as an apolitical , non-partisan , non-deliberative body obedient to civil authority ; mandatory military service has also been abolished .  
Just as Israel has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and free from threats or acts of force , as affirmed by Security Council resolution 242 ( 1967 ) , the territorial integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries should also be strictly respected , in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , including resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
On the question of the funding of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , of particular importance to developing countries is , first , the new appeal for a substantial increase in resources for these activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and for intensified efforts to mobilize the political will to achieve this .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
We are all aware that we live in an age when political decisions can be influenced by the emotional power of visual images , whose instant , worldwide transmission has been made possible by rapid-fire advances in everything from satellite technology to personal computers .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The representative pointed out some of the social , political and economic consequences of the events in her country , including physical , psychological , moral and spiritual destabilization of the population , total destruction of the structures of the State and an economy which is now dominated by humanitarian assistance .  
The Board 's analysis of country offices in the biennium established the common causes of unsatisfactory implementation as political instability , frequent changes in the leadership of implementing partners , delayed delivery of supplies , unrealistic project targets and late receipt of funds .  
This year 's international conferences HABITAT II , the World Food Summit and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have marked the completion of a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsored conferences which covered the full range of civil , political , economic and social issues that affect the peoples of the world .  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
Even when , as is more usual , the formal political boundaries remain intact , the ability of capitals of large and relatively homogeneous States to impose a single direction over all their constituent parts is clearly diminishing . 
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
The wealth of the Caspian Sea , its unique biological and mineral structure and fragile ecological system call for a comprehensive and balanced approach , free from short-term profit or political advantage .  
As we approach the next millennium and as the pre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the definition of national sovereignty , we must seriously question why a powerful minority is still allowed to bankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow economic and political needs .  
There is an urgent need to draw up and put into effect measures and strategies which , on the basis of international cooperation and shared responsibility , will make it possible to launch a comprehensive attack on this phenomenon and to do away with partial and subjective evaluations in rating the level of compliance of each Government in combating drug trafficking , or , still worse , in making use of this rating as a political weapon and pressure tactic .  
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States . Disarmament , sustainable development , enhancement of the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are priority issues that affect the security and well-being of peoples throughout the world .  
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .  
Belize has proposed that we should establish an annual special session of this Assembly immediately prior to the general debate , at which we would discuss development policy and regenerate the political will necessary continually to revise the complex Agenda for Development and the commitments made in this Assembly , as well as at the high-level global conferences of this last decade of the twentieth century .  
In this regard , I am pleased to note that my country enjoys excellent , long-standing diplomatic relations with the five permanent members of the Security Council and that it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement , whose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an expression of steadfastness in our convictions and in continued political cooperation . 
In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
Despite the new international situation that promotes less aggressive , less suspicious and less tense relations between States , the political instability that continues to exist in certain parts of Africa , and the conflicts that develop there , have become significant barriers to the economic recovery and social cohesion of the continent .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
Tunisia 's steadfast efforts to consolidate the foundations of the country 's political institutions and the rule of law and to promote and protect human rights in their global dimension flow from a civilized , irreversible choice made in accordance with universal values .  
Eager to ensure respect for human dignity and to encourage ongoing development efforts to secure the well-being of all citizens , Tunisia has been able to reconcile , in a balanced manner , economic growth with the preservation of political , economic and social rights , the requisite foundations of democracy .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
The economic and social gap between the nations of the world is still wide in spite of positive political and economic developments on the regional and international scene , the creation of economic blocs , and free trade in the world .  
It firmly declares the will of all political forces in Bulgaria Mr . Lukanov having been an active member of Parliament for the last seven years not to permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the path towards economic and political reform or to infringe on the peaceful and lawful process of political and public life , including the forthcoming presidential elections at the end of this month .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
To some extent , this phenomenon may be similar to that described as the emergence of the imprecise State , found in a wide variety of non-State political bodies or agents that have an international impact through the intricate network of non-governmental organizations and multinational political movements whose proliferation is another sign of the new interdependence , and which play an increasingly active role in the management of the world system .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
The calm , orderly and transparent holding of partial legislative elections on 4 and 18 August 1996 illustrates the resolve of the Togolese people , with the impetus of the Head of State , Mr . Gnassingbe Eyadema , to move forward along the road to democracy , peace and political stability , which guarantee social and economic development .  
The Blue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who provide political , economic , social and humanitarian assistance , thus contributing to the stabilization of situations and conflicts as well as to the search for a political settlement to conflicts through national reconciliation whenever necessary .  
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
The characteristic distinction of the late twentieth century is that relations among nations are based on interrelated , mutual and diverse interests in various political , economic and social fields .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
It is a human , social , political and economic imperative for the international community and for all the actors and partners in development , in their own specific actions , to work responsibly for a more just and equitable framework for international trade , favouring a free and democratic economic partnership .  
The various summits that it has organized in recent years , coupled with its numerous activities covering the entire spectrum of political , social and economic spheres , in all corners of the world , is testimony to the critical role of the United Nations in resolving the national and international problems facing mankind .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
We would therefore be deeply appreciative if this understanding were translated into tangible results and if the subsequent technical discussions held following political consultations were much more fruitful .  
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
There is evidence the world over that continuing poverty , if not addressed adequately , will result in social disharmony and in economic and political disorder , and will become a threat to national and international peace and stability , thereby negatively affecting the growth and consolidation of democracy and human rights .  
In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , I stressed , on behalf of the Government of San Marino , the need to reconsider the instrument of the embargo , its effectiveness and repercussions , especially in those cases where , in the absence of armed conflict , international isolation alone has proved a valid moral and political means of international pressure .  
The Sudan is of the view that the structure of the international community , which is based on ideological , political and cultural diversity and pluralism , prompts us all to accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony and diversity among nations become the vehicle for interaction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing national interests in the context of the international system .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
Not only is this new Constitution the best we have ever had , but it also embraces the people 's political expectations for the advent of a true sense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of freedom , respect for human rights , and a strong nationalistic feeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of the world on a free and equitable basis . 
The consequent void of economic and political instability has provided an opening for many unscrupulous , self-proclaimed leaders who , hungry for power , are reigniting the myths , latent prejudices , hatreds and fears lying in the dark recesses of so many minds .  
Three months before general elections are to be held , the Government will demit office and hand over power to a non-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be headed by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the country and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities appointed on his advice , keeping in mind the sensitivities of the major political parties .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
At the same time , it was able to ensure political stability , improve security and engineer a rapid economic recovery , as reflected by a strong gross domestic product growth of 7.6 per cent , an inflation rate kept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of the national currency throughout 1995 .  
Yet , strengthened by his popular legitimacy and the support of a broad majority of the people of the Comoros , in six months President Taki drafted the broad outlines of political , economic and social reforms to overcome the numerous obstacles impeding the construction of a democratic , prosperous and interdependent society in the Comoros .  
We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources , a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and , on our part , clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies we shall , in due course , place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth .  
The present momentum for the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal should not be lost , but should be matched by commensurate political will to ensure that the work is completed in time for a conference in 1998 .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
Looking at current economic , social and political conditions on our continent , including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin , one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development .  
The United Nations will not be strong and effective if it allows cardinal principles of international law , such as respect for sovereignty , the territorial integrity of States and the right of States freely to choose their political , economic and social system , to succumb to unilateral political interests and the imposition of models .  
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
While the former limitations are constant , being structural , and in principle could be removed only at the cost of a distortion of the judicial function or a profound transformation of the political environment in which it is performed , the latter are reversible , but have the drawback of being extremely unpredictable . 
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
At the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen , our leaders committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
In order to implement commitment 2 of the Copenhagen Declaration , Mexico has accepted the imperative ethical , social , political and economic need to overcome poverty by taking vigorous action , with the main short-term objective of mitigating the effects of deficiencies and the long-term aim of establishing conditions for the sustained reduction of economic and social inequality .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation 's sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help to generate renewed political will at the national and international levels to attain the objectives of sustainable human development .  
Furthermore , to translate those promises into working realities , the General Assembly at its fiftieth session stressed , inter alia , the need for renewed , solid political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and their well-being so as to achieve the objectives of social development , and reiterated its call upon the world 's Governments to fulfil their commitments made at the Summit .  
The Social Summit expressed the political will to take advantage of a window of opportunity that has opened in the world with the end of the cold war to let in fresh air and to overcome the age-old ideological intolerance and rivalries of power politics , which were impediments to true international solidarity and served only selfish self-interest .  
If we think only of these two items , 194 trade union organizations asked by their central organ to promote the objectives of employment at the national level and more than 100 parliaments also resolved to take initiatives on the Summit , we realize how this process has been gaining ground in the political and main social sectors in our countries .  
Wilmot ( Ghana ) : At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , world leaders took tough political decisions and committed themselves to create an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve social development and social justice .  
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
There is a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction sometimes veiled and sometimes explicit with an Organization that still embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by the human spirit in the search for peace and understanding among peoples .  Brazil is committed to the United Nations Charter and to the Organization 's political , legal and diplomatic legacy of the past 50 years .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
The Italian proposal addresses and reconciles the two major changes that have occurred on the international scene since the end of the Second World War : first , the emergence of a group of countries with considerable economic and political capacities , including Italy , which by 1 January 1998 will be the fifth largest contributor to the United Nations budget ; and secondly , the emergence of the developing countries , which are far more numerous and important today than they were in 1965 , when the Security Council was enlarged .  
Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
The mid-term review of the implementation of this important political pact highlights not only the great sacrifices made by the African countries in introducing both structural and institutional reforms and the efforts of the international community to support economic recovery and social development in Africa , but also the long road that remains to be travelled to attain the main objectives of the programme .  
The social , economic and political circumstances and conditions in which African countries find themselves today , the loaded agenda for international cooperation for development , and the ongoing efforts to define a people-centred and environmentally acceptable road to economic growth and development , among other factors , lend a high degree of complexity to a process such as the one that has just been completed .  
Only a few weeks ago , the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) allowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved by African countries at the political , economic and social levels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the continent .  
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
Furthermore , Mexico reaffirms that , in strict accordance with the principles of international law governing relations among States , only Cuba , in the exercise of its inalienable rights , can determine as a free , sovereign and independent State its own political , social and economic system .  
That is , there should be systems of government with checks and balances , which guarantee the free exercise of the civil , political , social and cultural rights of the people , and which enhance the development of a free and dynamic society the only way to ensure harmonious and sustainable development .  
We are grateful to all Member States that supported our appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universal respect of international law as reflected , for instance , in General Assembly resolution 49 / 43 , which created the political conditions and legal framework for the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia .  
Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
The recent kidnapping incident appeared to put the peace process into question , but the Government as well as the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) clearly opted for peace , and we are pleased to note that partial agreements on pending issues such as the ceasefire , constitutional reform and the reintegration of URNG guerrillas into the political life of Guatemala will be signed in Oslo , Stockholm and Madrid respectively during the first half of December . We urge the parties to do their utmost to adhere to this programme . 
We are convinced that progress in the political and institutional areas in Central America can be consolidated only if they are accompanied by similar progress in economic development and by considerable reconstruction of the social fabric in those countries .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
Among the critical ones are ensuring the peaceful nature of political reforms ; establishing and consolidating domestic democratic institutions and standards ; restructuring ; and ensuring a social orientation that promotes economic transformation and is consolidated by a system of measures and safeguards to preserve social justice and protect society .  
In so doing , Japan deems it important to keep in mind in particular that in our present-day world , peace and stability can not be achieved and maintained solely on the basis of political and military factors , but that stable and durable peace can be realized only through efforts that take into account a wider perspective which comprises humanitarian concerns and social and economic reconstruction and development as well .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
In both Declarations , the international community recognized that no State has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other State , and that no State may use or encourage the use of economic , political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights or to secure from it advantages of any kind .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
This has caused discord in world thinking and created mutual suspicions that not only pose an overwhelming threat , jeopardizing the march of political progress and the activities of economic development as well as the fabric of social development , but also have raised questions as to whether the benefits of science and technology lead to world security and stability , or quite the opposite .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
Israel ought to have realized and accepted the fundamental truth that the key to its long-term security is not through the permanent occupation of neighbouring territories and the maintenance of a hawkish attitude towards its neighbours , but through the forging of a political compact with these neighbours .  
The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
While others were progressing , we were stagnating , locked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elements imported from the cold war , which arbitrarily kept in check for 40 years our political , social and economic evolution .  
The international response , however , will to a large extent remain insufficient if it is not reflected in concrete action in line with three requirements : the establishment of true international cooperation ; a show of greater solidarity ; and determination commensurate with regularly stated political commitments .  
It should be marked by a constant , unfailing mobilization of efforts to dismantle the criminal chain of terrorism , including those who are perpetrators , those who are behind them , the various political networks and their sources of financing and supply , and the direct or indirect logistical support given by individuals , groups or States .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
It is on that continent that we find the greatest expression of the categorical need for renewed and strengthened international solidarity in a spirit of open-mindedness and partnership to help African countries in their efforts at the socio-economic restructuring necessary to lay the foundations for lasting political and social balance and to open new prospects of hope for their peoples .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 50 / 39 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and facilitating the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
There was also a broad understanding between the concerned parties that the next step would be the formation of a political commission or a broad-based , fully representative council , although some differences still exist on composition and sequence , as well as on the issue of demobilization of armed militias , the collection of heavy weapons , demilitarization and the establishment of a national security force .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
It should have been removed from the agenda long ago on account of its negative political motive and in view of the fact that its substance is devoid of any subject not included in other resolutions .  
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
The general political climate prevailing in international relations is creating a set of circumstances that are favourable for the methodical pursuit of the work of disarmament , whose process of multilateral negotiations should be revitalized .  
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Recalling that the commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
" Recalling that the commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Despite continuing difficulties , a basis had now been laid for a qualitatively new political and psychological climate in the region that opened the way for the peaceful coexistence of Palestinians and Israelis and the attainment of specific results in the current negotiating stage , which was both complex and sensitive . 
The agreement , which recognized the sovereignty of Croatia over Eastern Slavonia and guaranteed the rights of the local Serb population , represented a major step forward , and the European Union wished to pay tribute to the moderation of the leaders involved on all sides and to the efforts of United Nations personnel , the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , and the personnel of other international organizations , who had all helped to bring about a political solution . 
One key objective of advocacy is to create a supportive and enabling cultural , social and political environment for reproductive health .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
We hope that the two parties concerned will put the interests of Croatian people of all ethnic origins above their differences , adopt a constructive approach , build mutual trust and implement the Basic Agreement in earnest so as to create conditions favourable for advancing the process of achieving a political settlement of the question of Croatia .  
While they are clearly assured of the support of UNTAES and the entire international community , it will be only through their political will and untiring efforts to reconcile and rebuild a harmonious multi-ethnic society that real progress can be achieved over the long term .  I should now like to turn to the other , technical draft resolution before the Council .  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
The international community was taking a more balanced approach to the issue , which included economic , social and cultural rights along with civil and political rights .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .

The Government of Cyprus was committed to ensuring that women enjoyed all their human rights and that they were equal partners in shaping the economic , political , social and cultural development of their country .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
The Constitution contained provisions entitling women to remedial and affirmative action , with a view to enabling them to participate in political , economic and social life and gain access to positions in public and private institutions on an equal footing with men .  
With regard to the human rights of women , particularly the right to equal status , which was dealt with in the Beijing Platform for Action , he stressed that the first woman prime minister in the world had been elected in Sri Lanka and that the election of Mrs .

The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .  
Responding to allegations that the armed forces of Myanmar had committed unseemly acts in border areas , he rejected them and insisted that the local population in those areas was experiencing unprecedented levels of progress in the political , economic and social fields and that the armed forces of Myanmar , which had a distinguished history and a fine tradition born of the struggle for independence , were well known for their good discipline and exemplary conduct .  
Such significant progress in political , economic and social conditions was contributing to an unprecedented quality of life for the entire population of Myanmar and not merely for the privileged few , as alleged by some critics .  
Iraq had repeatedly stated that a responsive environment and suitable economic and political conditions were essential to guarantee fundamental rights of the individual , which were the pillar of the Iraqi political and constitutional system .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
Owing to his personal prestige and his great political stature and vast political experience , President Mobutu is a true adept at regional , African and international affairs alike whether or not his detractors agree .  
Hence , to try to ostracize or marginalize a political leader of Mr . Mobutu 's stature a leader who , furthermore , heads so vast a country blessed with such exceptional resources , despite its temporary problems is both unrealistic and contrary to the norms of international law .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .  It was in that spirit that his delegation supported the appeal for new human and financial resources launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .  
Aware of the importance of a human rights culture and of the need to strengthen the democratic process , her Government had implemented a series of legislative , administrative and educational measures recommended by the advisory committee on human rights , a national body established in 1990 , which was composed of representatives of the entire political , social and religious spectrum of Moroccan society .  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
While the administrative restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights fell within the scope of the Fifth Committee , it was the task of the Third Committee to study the restructuring of policy , ensuring that emphasis was placed on economic , social and cultural rights , which were being neglected because priority was still being accorded to civil and political rights .  
and the Fourth World Conference on Women , 4 / within which it was noted that the family is the basic unit of society and as such should be strengthened , that it is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support , that in different cultural , political and social systems various forms of family exist and that the rights , capabilities and responsibilities of family members must be respected , E . 95 .

Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Multiple frameworks generate confusion at both political and administrative levels about which frameworks prevail over others ; often compete for the small pool of highly qualified national personnel available to direct and implement the planning exercises ; and raise expectations about sectoral planning that are not achievable except through persistent commitment at the national and international levels . 
To support standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
LAMAMRA ( Algeria ) said that an independent and effective international jurisdiction must be established which would enjoy unquestioned moral authority and whose actions would be guided solely by the rule of law , far removed from the political influences that could pervert it .  
( a bis ) Support , through legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote their interests and become involved in local and national economic , social and political decision-making ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
The Republic of Tajikistan has consistently adhered to the policy of settling the inter-Tajik conflict through exclusively peaceful , political means and , in fulfilment of the hopes and aspirations of all citizens of Tajikistan for a comprehensive peace and calm in the country , is taking an active position at the inter-Tajik talks being held in Ashkhabad and is putting forward new and constructive proposals . 
A solution to the problems of personal security in the region will thus require a comprehensive and interrelated view of all aspects of sustainable development in Central America in its political , economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions ;  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
Progress in the political transition , for instance , the consolidation of new democratic institutions , the convergence of opinions in favour of the primacy of civilian authority , the normal conduct of elections , the emergence of new forms of representation of civil society and the national consensus surrounding the broadening of the political sectors incorporated in the Congress of the Republic .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
In general , desk officers and military mission officers deal with day-to-day operational and related political issues that affect the mandate and conduct of operations , as well as a broad range of other issues , which include military , logistical , administrative , humanitarian , electoral and legal issues .  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
Additionally , we note that at this time the National Police Force is not adequately trained or fully operational , which is a vital aspect for moving Haiti away from its turbulent past and pointing it in the direction of political stability , lasting democracy , constitutional order , economic prosperity and national reconciliation .  
The United Nations Mission in Haiti ( UNMIH ) has done a commendable job in assisting the Haitian authorities in sustaining a secure and stable environment , in organizing successful municipal and legislative elections and , above all , in managing the smooth transition from one democratically elected president to another no mean feat , given the tortured political history of Haiti .  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .  
The Government of Cuba has sound and undeniable proof , from the legal and political points of view , that the acts of violation and aggression against Cuban airspace perpetrated for more than 35 years , and most recently by aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " , have had a subversive , hostile , aggressive and terrorist character .  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;

Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Recalling further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Also urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American Presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America " 6 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a redefining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
Considering that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
Recognizing further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
It remained the principal producer of illicit opiates in the Golden Triangle of south-east Asia and the major source of heroin found in the illicit North American market in 1994 / 95 , taking advantage of favourable political developments , UNDCP assisted the Government in the elaboration of an alternative development project involving a minority group ( the Wa ) in northern Myanmar .  
The Minister of the Interior stated that the Sudan could possibly be more successful in its efforts to locate the suspects provided it received full cooperation from the relevant Ethiopian and Egyptian agencies and provided the matter was treated as a criminal case ; he added that , if the case was treated as a political issue , all efforts of the Sudan would be in vain .  
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
As may be seen , the United States authorities were perfectly aware of the existence of a group organized in the territory of the United States , equipped with aircraft and involved in carrying out activities inconsistent with the provision of international air services , which uses those aircraft for patently political purposes , disregarding Cuban sovereignty and also ignoring the regulations of the very State in which those aircraft are registered and where its pilots had obtained licences to operate them .  
All documented sources , including those of the information media and the international relief organizations , have confirmed that it is Uganda that provides support and that it is the major source arming the insurgency and supplying it with men and logistic , military and political support and providing transit access to all the forces and parties that are supporting the insurgency .

Some delegations noted that the classical distinction into civil and political rights as justiciable , and economic , social and cultural rights as non-justiciable could , in the light of practice , case law and academic writings , no longer be maintained .  
Reaffirming General Assembly resolutions 50 / 173 of 22 December 1995 on the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education , 1995-2004 , and 49 / 184 of 23 December 1994 , in which the Assembly expressed the conviction that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social [ and of the right to development ] , 5 ter preambular paragraph .  
The aim is clear : it is to punish Cuba for seeking tenaciously to determine freely , sovereignly and independently its own political , economic and social organization ; for securing for its people a future of justice , free from foreign interference and petty interests such as those which , for more than 60 years , controlled the country under the protection of United States .  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
On 22 December 1995 , during the last plenary session of this first phase of the Ashkhabad talks , the delegation of the opposition unexpectedly declared that it would not consider it appropriate to renew the continuous round of inter-Tajik talks unless the heads of State of the Commonwealth of Independent States , at their scheduled summit in mid-January 1996 , clearly defined their position with regard to a political settlement in Tajikistan and supported that position with concrete acts .  
The Government of Guatemala considers that the foregoing reaffirms the mutual trust between the parties that characterizes the current phase of the negotiations , and reiterates its commitment to achieve as soon as possible a negotiated political solution to the internal armed confrontation , in order to strengthen the building of a firm and lasting peace .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Article 5 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that no law enforcement official may inflict , instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war , a threat to national security , international political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
A state of war ( in 49 countries ) , a threat of war ( in 46 countries ) , a threat to national security ( in 52 countries ) , internal political instability ( in 52 countries ) and other public emergency ( in 49 countries ) is not sufficient justification for torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
Continue to support the role of multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies in the provision of structured finance including loans and equity ; senior lender guarantees ; political risk insurance and re-insurance ; in the development of small supporting businesses , through soft loans ; and in the development of internal financial institutions through loans and guarantees and the introduction of stock exchanges etc .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
The normalization of the political situation , the restoration of mutual trust and the creation of viable mechanisms for ensuring lasting peace , stability and security are essential if these riches are to be used with maximum effectiveness for the benefit of all the peoples and all inhabitants of our region , and the advantageous transport and geographical conditions are to be fully exploited .  
However , the success of the policies followed depends on the underlying preconditions for private sector development , including stable and credible political conditions , law and order , and the continuity of policies which in themselves must be credible , consistent and transparent , as well as stable macroeconomic conditions .  
In accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 20 , the study covers a wide area , ranging from the licit to the illicit and from the bio-medical field to the economic , social , political and epidemiological fields .  
Throughout the long , grave political crisis , that brought my country to the brink of collapse , Haiti has committed itself to national reconstruction with a view to creating a State based on law and a democratic regime able to guarantee all of its citizens economic and social well-being .  
Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Meeting the challenge requires the allocation of commensurate resources by the international community and the maintenance of a strong collective political will , keeping in mind that no State can afford to be complacent in responding to organized transnational crime .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
According to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the term " discrimination against women " is used to denote all forms of discrimination , deprivation and restriction that prevents or eliminates or aims to prevent or eliminate the recognition , utilization and benefiting of women from all political , economic , social , cultural , civil and other fundamental rights and freedoms of human beings as based on the equality of the sexes and regardless of their civil status .  
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .  Its support staff will consist of 10 international and locally recruited General Service staff and 2 security officers .  
The Authority is doing this based on overwhelming popular support , which was crystallized in the historic election process conducted by the Palestinian people in January of this year , during which our people voiced their political choices clearly in favour of the peace process and gave a vote of confidence and constitutional legitimacy to the Palestinian leadership .  
At the same time , we wish to stress our belief that a complete and absolute solution to the problem of extremism and terrorism is linked to bringing an end to the unfair and unjust practices against our people , to the achievement of further political progress in the peace process and to improvements in the living conditions and the difficult economic situation of our people .  
The land incursion , sea blockade and air attack by Israel demonstrate once again its utter contempt for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon . By its action , Israel has violated not only the most basic principles governing relations between States , as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , which we all espouse , but also international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions , particularly resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
Provided effective support to standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
Finally , a sixth objective is to respond to the expressed need of the international community for the annual consideration , review and evaluation of continuing developments related to the law of the sea and ocean affairs in the General Assembly through the monitoring and analysis of and reporting on developments relating to the law of the sea and ocean affairs , including legal , political , economic , technological and scientific developments .  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
Promoting effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
The Copenhagen Programme of Action provides a rich source of ideas and practical suggestions that might constitute elements of effective national strategies that would command the required political support at national level , in full recognition of both the diversity of country situations and the need for coherent , organized efforts , with a clear purpose . 
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , at both the national and international levels , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food , and physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
The foreseeable developments in the international context - economic , political and institutional - following the Uruguay Round and the advance of regional and subregional integration agreements can offer some opportunities for countries whose productive and export-driven development has been retarded ; nevertheless , they also entail a significant erosion of the opportunities for implementing selective policies to promote such development .  
The fourth objective is to promote the establishment of regional institutional mechanisms to guarantee the full collaboration and participation of women in the main spheres of economic , political and social development .  
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
The Organization will be a central actor in this respect for the foreseeable future , not simply because of its role within the international community , but also because Africa 's problems encompass political , economic , social and environmental dimensions that require the integrated approach that only the United Nations can provide .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
The Acting Director commented that translating complex concepts which were condensed in one word , as in the case of " gender " or " empowerment " , required adequate understanding of the cultural , economic , religious , social and political circumstances of different countries . 
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
During the visit , I was able to meet with the local political leadership and express support for those who seek to implement the Peace Agreement and its vision of a single multi-ethnic country , two entities peacefully coexisting and elections that are free and fair .  
The course covers human rights protection of women in all pertinent areas , thus encompassing civil and political and economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues relating to humanitarian law .  
Recalling that the commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
In this connection , the Council pledges its continued political and material support for the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission entrusted with the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and invites the international community to participate actively in supporting the Commission 's efforts in every way possible in order to enable it to achieve its objective of placing the security and stability of the region on a firm foundation .  
Although at times difficult political , economic and technical problems had to be solved , common sense and the two sides ' commitment to their international obligations always won out .  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
The Ministers , without prejudice to their respective positions of principle regarding the political status of East Timor , continued their discussions on those substantive issues which have been identified related to an eventual framework for the achievement of a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor as well as other related issues , inter alia , the preservation and promotion of the cultural identity of the East Timorese people and bilateral relations between Indonesia and Portugal .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
As a result of resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , the fundamental rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its 21.3-million people to participate in international political , economic and cultural activities have not been respected and protected in the same way that the rights of peoples of other States have , and the stability in the region of the Taiwan Strait is also threatened .  
Papua New Guinea therefore urged those States that were members of the Committee and other States , including the administering Powers , to acknowledge the importance and usefulness of regional seminars as one of the most effective ways of assessing the political , constitutional , economic and social development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories . The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m . 
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
The third conclusion was that the underlying causes of the eruption of violent incidents and episodes had not been removed : political rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be suppressed and religious tensions and the immigration of Indonesians into the Territory were putting in jeopardy the cultural , religious and social identity of East Timor .  
We fully believe that through mutual good will , realism and observance of international commitments , the tendencies aiming at the maintenance of tension in the region will be defeated and a sound political decision in favour of peace and stability and our good multi-purpose relations with the fraternal Republic of Tajikistan will prevail , and no place will be left for the exchange of such notes where wisdom and common sense stand firm .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
Article 9.2 : " It is incumbent upon the public authorities to promote conditions which ensure that the freedom and equality of individuals and of the groups to which they belong are real and effective , to remove obstacles which prevent or hinder their full enjoyment , and to facilitate participation by all citizens in political , economic , cultural and social life . "  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
Two recent assessments for industrialized countries have included specified functions such as recreation , conservation , protection , hunting and grazing , and for each have shown the total forest area broken down into importance classes - high , medium and low .  It has also given a verbal account of " hot " political issues .  
The United States Secretary of Defense and Speaker of the House have recently intensified their campaign of disinformation and hostile propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by the reckless suggestion of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran respectively on National Public Radio on 2 August and NBC 's " Meet the Press " of 28 July - statements which represent blatant examples of political manipulation of public opinion already apprehensive about the recent tragic events . 
While an eco-regional approach may facilitate scientific understanding , it is widely recognized that there is a need to ensure early endorsement of recommended action by intergovernmental forums or major political groupings , since political and policy-level acceptance is a precondition for lasting national commitment and continued country-level implementation .  
Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
Democratic and pluralistic political systems have been established ; central planning and State controls have been dismantled : prices have been liberalized , most eastern European currencies are convertible , and consumers and producers are essentially free to make decisions according to their preferences .  
This is a sign that confidence in at least the medium run is being restored and that key institutional reforms , as well as a reasonable degree of macroeconomic and political stability , are being attained .  
Both at the eighth ministerial meeting at Yaound and at the Bureau meeting at Brazzaville , it was felt that while the primary responsibility for resolving the political and security problems in the Central African subregion rested with the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned , concerted action at the subregional and wider levels was required to promote lasting solutions .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
Realizing the increasingly important role of indigenous people and youth in solving the major problems facing humankind and the need to provide them with broader opportunities to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , cultural , spiritual and moral life of their peoples , as partners in development ,  
It is necessary for them to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , educational , cultural , spiritual and moral life as partners in the development of society .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious intercommunity relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , [ in the framework of their beliefs ] * Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women and the girl child . 
In the spirit of cooperative linkages for joint exploration of human potentials , we agree to focus on partnership actions that clarify , interpret , create , protect and promote socio-legal , political , economic , educational , cultural , moral and spiritual processes affecting the abilities of indigenous people and youth to choose , maintain , access , encourage , manage and actualize their diverse ways of achieving just and humane growth and development .  
The process should build on national capacity and be based on the following characteristics , considering the situation of each country : well defined linkages to macro-level policies and policy processes ; closely linked cross-sectoral policies and issues , particularly land-use policies ; high-level political commitment and broad-based support ; participatory and decentralized planning approaches , including the use of local knowledge ; and identification and management of conflicts between relevant actors .  
The concept of national forest programmes should be considered as iterative and in permanent evolution in order to be fully efficient and adapted to changing economic , social and political situations .  
TAKING NOTE that the essential purposes proclaimed by the Organization of American States are , inter alia , to seek the solution of political , juridical and economic problems that may arise among them ; and to promote by cooperative action , their economic , social and cultural development ,  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
The United Nations will promote necessary measures to strengthen laws , policies and programmes that would ensure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life as equal partners and the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all women .  
But beyond those concrete achievements , the fact that all the Council 's decisions have been adopted by consensus , that all the Commissioners have also been appointed by consensus and that all their recommendations are unanimous and also approved by the Council by consensus , always without a vote , gives the Commission outstanding legal , political and moral authority . 
" We welcome the acknowledgement , by the Special Rapporteur , of the complexity and uniqueness of Brazil 's sociological context , in which economic , social , cultural , political and historic factors play a decisive role and contribute to explain the profound interbreeding of races - Amerindian , European and African . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The political maturity displayed during and after the general elections by Pierre Buyoya , who gracefully handed over power to the victor , was unceremoniously shattered once again , giving way to a difficult situation which has left the country fragmented and has compounded the problem of mistrust among conflicting parties .  
The military coup d'etat of 25 July last in Burundi was a violent act that flew in the face of established constitutional order , accelerated the spiral of violence and arbitrarily usurped political power to the detriment of democracy , national reconciliation and peace in that country .  
We urge them to find without delay the appropriate political mechanisms to make it possible to find a satisfactory solution to the crisis , with the understanding that only a broad and permanent political settlement providing for how the Government will be shared between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority can constitute the key element for establishing peace and harmony between Burundians , putting Burundi back on the path towards democracy and making possible international cooperation for reconstruction , development and the stability of the country .  
These include the unbanning of all political parties , the restoration of the National Assembly , the initiation of businesslike and unconditional negotiations between all political and military powers in the context of the mediation efforts pursued by former President Nyerere , guarantees for the security and safety of members of the former Government , the immediate cessation of all acts of violence , ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the targeted needy groups throughout Burundi and ensuring the safety and security of personnel of regional and international humanitarian agencies .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
The international community reached a consensus and committed itself to the goal of poverty eradication at the major United Nations conferences and summits of the 1990s , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative .  
While the United Nations system has an essential and complementary role to play in supporting Governments in their efforts to eradicate poverty , the primary responsibility for the assessment of poverty situations and for the formulation , strengthening and implementation of national poverty eradication plans and programmes lies with Governments and requires a strong political commitment at the national level .  
As an expression of their firm political will to employ all legal means to prevent , combat and eliminate terrorism , shall promote strict and timely compliance with applicable extradition treaties or , if appropriate , shall deliver the alleged perpetrators of terrorist acts to their competent authorities for prosecution , in accordance with their domestic laws , if sufficient legal grounds for doing so exist .  
Continuing the process of broadening national consensus , political forces and representatives of civil society in Panama gathered at the " Encuentro Panama 2000 " and pledged to keep issues relating to the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 outside partisan political considerations ; to reinforce the rule of law ; and to hold transparent elections in 1999 .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
The attitude and statements of the United States set a grave precedent in the history of international relations and run counter to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , Article 2 , paragraph 4 , of which reads : " All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations . "  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
UNICEF 's review of country experiences where remarkable social progress has been achieved shows that their common features include strong political commitment to the well-being of children , widespread community participation in the delivery of basic social services and the allocation of adequate resources to the cause of children .  
In any case , the Special Rapporteur has raised questions and issues which need to be resolved in the light of improved knowledge of the facts and specific reports and following a systematic analysis that will produce suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational criteria concerning mercenary activities .  
The Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Council in its resolution 11 ( II ) of 21 June 1946 to prepare recommendations and reports to the Council on promoting women 's rights in political , economic , civil , social and educational fields and to make recommendations to the Council on urgent problems requiring immediate attention in the field of women 's rights with the object of implementing the principle that men and women shall have equal rights , and to develop proposals to give effect to such recommendations .  
The Consultative Committee also approved a programme that enables UNIFEM to analyse , publish and disseminate findings and lessons learned from both its own work and experiences gathered in partnership with international , United Nations system , regional and national organizations and networks on promoting women 's political and economic empowerment .  
The situation of refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa has continued to be influenced by the harsh socio-economic realities of the continent and the related problems of the evolution of viable political institutions and processes based on democratic principles that will accommodate the diversity of cultures and the aspiration for peace , security and sustainable development .  
Considering the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations calling , inter alia , for the promotion of international cooperation in solving problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ,  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
Van der Stoel attempts to invoke the issue of missing Kuwaitis for obvious political purposes unrelated to human rights with a view to the continued exercise of pressure on the Government of Iraq and prolongation of the economic embargo and hence the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
If the enemies do not return our small submarine , survivors and the dead unconditionally while continuing to make ill use of the incident for the sinister political purpose , we will be forced to take strong countermeasures .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
In view of the sharp exacerbation of the crisis in Afghanistan , a meeting of the Security Council must be held immediately with the participation of the countries concerned for the purpose of drawing up urgent measures to halt the bloodshed , bring about a political settlement of the conflict and extend assistance to the civilian population and the numerous refugees .  
As already noted , the reduction of UNMIH 's military element necessitated a concentration of the remaining forces in Port-au-Prince ( see attached map ) , which , as the centre of economic , political and social activity in Haiti , is critical to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment .  
In this , the political leadership is also obliged to support and foster the development of both the formal human rights institutions that were established by the Peace Agreement and Federation Constitutions , and the informal non-governmental structures that are an integral part of the development of civil society .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
A permanent and independent electoral commission responsible for the conduct of elections would be an indispensable component of a neutral political environment in which parties , candidates and the public have maximum faith in the integrity of the electoral process .  
Periodic natural and man-made disasters and other adverse situations , including political instability and civil strife and problems of refugees and their attendant negative consequences , continue to imperil the fragile socio-economic conditions in many least developed countries .  
Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
His delegation believed that terrorism could be defined as the commission of acts of murder , assassination , bombing , hostage-taking or the seizure of aircraft or ships in order to provoke a state of terror for political purposes , whether by individuals or States and whether against other individuals or other States , in circumstances other than those of legitimate armed conflict for liberation from all forms of foreign domination or from colonial , occupying , racist or other forces , and , in particular , when undertaken by liberation movements recognized by regional and international organizations .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
This situation is particularly lamentable in the light of the fact that several States parties to the Convention are in possession of the financial and technical means to enable them to establish a system of rapid alert in regions where political situations are identified as being volatile .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .  
These populations can not be expected to return to their homes if the political systems and national laws to which they are subject fail to offer them reliable guarantees against summary executions , enforced disappearances , torture and unfair trials .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
On 11 April 1995 , the qualifications board of the Ignacio Agramonte lower secondary school dismissed \ x { 8072 } gel D \ x { 5adb } alo Machado from his post as a physics teacher for not participating in the activities of the escuela al campo ( a period of mandatory service by students in rural areas ) or in political activities , and for not paying dues to the official union .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
The relevant commitment , commitment 2 , reads , as adopted : We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
Experience in countries that have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which pay attention to the distribution of income and to investment in human resources through basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved , is fundamental to the eradication of poverty .  
In essence , the assumption of all governmental powers by SLORC in 1988 constituted , as mentioned earlier , a break from constitutionality and legal continuity and further constituted a departure from the norms governing the enjoyment of political rights proclaimed in article 21 of the Universal Declaration . There could , arguably , have been some legitimacy in the assumption of power by SLORC , without the consent of the people , in circumstances which could be said to have amounted to a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary General of NLD in her compound .  
Convinced that political rights can not be developed or preserved unless basic minimum economic and social rights are realized , since 7 November 1987 - the date on which President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali acceded to the Supreme Magistrature - Tunisia has worked continuously to promote and protect the full range of political , economic and social rights .  
Social consensus and ongoing dialogue are the basic rules governing relations between all the political , economic and social partners , reflecting the recognition that comprehensive development can not be fully achieved until the impoverished have gained access to the essential attributes of dignity ; a goal that can be achieved only by combatting all forms of destitution and marginalization and making enhanced solidarity among all members of the national community an essential basis for all the reforms introduced .  II .  
From the abolition of slavery to the prohibition of practices - less brutal , but more subtle - used for purposes of political coercion or in so-called social education and prevention programmes , ILO 's international action to combat forced labour has been marked by a constant concern to ensure that persons work of their own free will .  
The latter convention calls for the immediate and complete abolition of forced labour in the following five forms : as a measure of coercion or political education ; as a measure of mobilization for purposes of economic development ; as a sanction for having participated in strikes ; and as a measure of racial , social , national or religious discrimination .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation called for urgent and immediate generation of political will in the international community to follow up and implement the recommendations of recent United Nations conferences , in particular commitments to new and additional financing for development and creation of a favourable international economic environment , inter alia , through transfer of technology and enhanced trade access of products from developing countries .  
The most positive and promising development during the period has been the dialogue and agreements at the political level between the Commission and the Government of Iraq leading to mutual undertakings on such crucial issues as access to sites for inspection and interviews as well as to the establishment of a joint programme of action , containing an outline of priority tasks to be accomplished , as originally proposed in the Commission 's April 1996 report to the Security Council .  
It was emphasized that there is no bureaucratic leadership at the top level within the system , which means that " the political system created is not an organization , but all the powers ( legislative , executive and judicial ) together , there is no budget allocated to this system ( enacted bodies are financed by self-resources by the constituency ) , there is a face-to-face democracy , that is a free gathering of all citizens in different neighbourhoods , citizens who enjoy full equality of their rights " .  
These constants are : ( a ) It was made clear to the Special Rapporteur during all the meetings he held with representatives of the Government of the Sudan at the highest level that the political agenda of the Government will not change : the principles and the basic regulations laid down in constitutional decrees 1 to 13 as amended , will be strictly observed in the policy-making process and no change will be made to these principles and basic regulations . 
It was said that the forum should have a broad mandate and that it should extend beyond a narrow human rights focus to include issues such as economic , social , cultural , political , civil , educational and developmental issues as well as play a role in the coordination of all relevant United Nations activities .  
Despite being forced to devote a large part of its human and material resources to defending its land and people against the expansionist policies of Israel , the Syrian Arab Republic had undertaken a comprehensive and successful social development programme .  The leadership provided by the President had ensured the political stability and democratic climate necessary for broad participation in youth-related activities .  
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
Together with the agreements already signed , this Agreement seeks to create the conditions for genuine reconciliation among the people of Guatemala , based upon respect for human rights and the diversity of its peoples and on their shared determination to overcome the lack of social , economic and political opportunities , which undermines democratic coexistence and restricts the development of the nation ,  
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
The right to development is related to all human rights but can not be identified with the sum of the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights or be confused with development itself .  
Key concerns addressed in the process - as discussed in detail in the first report - are political legitimacy , accountability and transparency ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; bureaucratic accountability ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
" The inhuman Israeli practices include the various material , political , cultural and social situations of the Arab citizens in the occupied region of the Syrian Arab Golan , not to mention the continuity of settlement policy , advancing to the Arab territories , destruction of building , theft of antiquities , investment and seizure of lands , natural resources and water sources . "  
Building increased public awareness of the social , economic and human costs of anti-personnel mines is essential to develop and sustain the necessary political will for a global anti-personnel mine ban .  
In Haiti , although there is no direct technical cooperation related to a specific project , close and regular coordination is maintained at a political level .  
The Committee also agreed with the Secretary-General 's view that efforts to ensure that the United Nations was equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century depended on , above all , continuous , predictable and assured political and financial support from Member States .  
The Serbian authorities are continuing their campaign of State terror through , to mention only a few forms , killing and torturing of Albanians , raids of homes throughout Kosova , illegal arrests and systematic persecution and maltreatment of political and human rights activists , imprisonment of people because of their political convictions , systematic and continued campaigns to destroy the Albanian cultural heritage , including by halting education in Albanian and crushing the efforts of the Albanians to preserve their identity in Kosova .  
Liberal International stated that it supported the rights of minorities by establishing formal or informal relations with minority organizations and their political parties , providing education and training , a platform for exchange as well as links to the Council of Europe , the United Nations and other international bodies , and assisting in raising awareness of minority issues at the international level .  
The Programme is conceived as a necessary global commitment and a major coordinated effort of the various national and international actors to develop and implement more than 300 top-priority renewable energy projects of national , regional and international value within a 10-year period in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility , economic viability and social and political acceptability of solar energy .  
On a different level , it is of fundamental importance that places of worship should be reserved for religious , non-political uses , that the legal system governing political parties should be defined in such a way as to avoid political variables impinging on religious constants , and that schools should be protected from all ideological , political or partisan indoctrination .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The rule of law is understood as a human right in itself but also as essential means for the protection of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
Starting in 1995 , political and economic transition in Mozambique has shown promising signs of a return to stability and normality : peace , national reconciliation and the vitality of the young democracy have taken root ; parliamentary performance improved noticeably ; one has witnessed an open , free and lively interface between government , legislature and media ; overall the social climate remained calm ; resettlement of internally displaced people and returning refugees was consolidated ; reintegration of demobilized soldiers has been relatively free of major disruption ;  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
The integrity of the statistical institution ( i.e . , whether it operated under a published statistical law and independently of political interference ) , the transparency of the statistical production and dissemination process , and public and equal access to information were three important concerns for winning the trust of users in official economic statistics .  
Women 's empowerment at the national , regional and global level required a multidimensional approach in the cultural , economic , political and social fields .  
At the regional level , the Economic Commission for Africa played a leading role in assisting Member States in their implementation of the Platform , focusing human and financial resources on enhancing women 's political leadership role and economic empowerment and promoting their legal and human rights .  
That was due to a number of factors , including sociological attitudes which perpetuated the domination of women ; illiteracy among women ( 91 per cent of women were illiterate ) ; the fact that women 's roles , needs and responsibilities were not seriously taken into account in economic and social development policies ; the priority accorded to technical solutions to women 's problems ; and the marginalization of women in political bodies , even though women represented a vast proportion of the electorate .  
The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1072 ( 1996 ) of 30 August 1996 , in which the Council decided to re-examine the question of Burundi on 31 October 1996 and requested me to report by that time on the situation in Burundi , including on the status of the immediate and unconditional negotiations which the Council required all of Burundi 's political parties and factions without exception , whether inside or outside the country and including representatives of civil society to initiate , with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement .  
We are hopeful that the coming consultations will overcome these obstacles and embody the political will expressed by the leaders of the world during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as their affirmation that the expansion of the Security Council is a basic condition for making its membership more representative and its working methods more transparent .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in the international political and economic arena Germany and Japan for example as well other influential countries in regional and global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council . 
Fed with misinformation from unscrupulous sources and armed groups that are in opposition to the Government , blinded by prejudice and preconceived notions and motivated by ulterior political reasons , some countries regrettably continue to make unfounded accusations . 
The Government can not accept any disruption of the ongoing political process and , having been fully aware of all the subversive activities going on clandestinely , was constrained to take preventive action against the sinister moves of NLD , which were apparently made in concert with the subversive elements , by bringing in the members of NLD temporarily for questioning .  
As security and political problems are directly tied to economic and social issues , the international community should enhance coordination between the Security Council and the other main organs of the United Nations , especially the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the International Court of Justice , so as to ensure their effective participation through political and legal consultations to enable a flow of information between them .  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
The European Union believed that the medium-term plan should reflect the political parameters established at the recent global conferences , promote their integrated implementation and assess the organizational needs , including the administrative and budgetary resources required to facilitate the implementation of the commitments undertaken . 
The problem lay in the grey areas and the limits that had to be set to prevent such advisers from becoming active in internal armed conflicts or in internal security affairs that affected the exercise of internationally recognized civil and political rights and freedoms .  
Such issues had to be resolved in the light of a better knowledge of the facts and a systematic analysis of political , legal and operational criteria applicable to mercenary activities .  
Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
He was convinced that , in the framework of a free democratic process , federalism and national and cultural self-determination , and not through violence , separatism and extremism , peoples could reaffirm their political status in addition to ensuring their economic , social and cultural development and well-being .  
Bearing in mind that Western media allegations of Libyan terrorism had proved false , his delegation joined with those which had stressed the need to draw up a code of conduct concerning the media and information with a view to reinforcing the ground rules for fairness and impartiality and respect for the choices of peoples relating to lifestyle and to political , economic , social and cultural development .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .  
Precisely because information could have such a profound influence on the political , social and moral development of societies , it was vital that societies set benchmarks for what was unacceptable and define the parameters of the acceptable .  
The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
It should be noted , however , that economies in transition are also far from being homogenous , reflecting differences in levels of economic development , enterprise culture , infrastructural and educational base , pre-communist economic and social patterns , geographic location and most of all the degree of the use of market mechanisms prior to the change in their political systems .  
This singling out of the Jehovah 's Witnesses is almost certainly due to their religious militancy , which is expressed through proselytism , conscientious objection to military service and a variety of public demonstrations which call into question the interests of the dominant Church and the legislative and political system of the State .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
On the subject of Afro-Colombian communities , Act No . 70 of 1993 reaffirmed the political , economic , social , cultural and territorial rights of such groups and protected their lifestyle as a development option based on their own logic and experience , in conditions of equality , equity , autonomy , participation and respect for cultural differences . 
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .  
The main reason for the unregulated status of hundreds of thousands of permanent residents of Latvia and Estonia of non-Latvian and non-Estonian origin is the legislation of those countries on the basis of which those persons have arbitrarily been deprived of their citizenship and have been declared to be aliens in their own countries of residence whose fundamental political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights are thus being curtailed .  
Also commends the work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women in providing a strategic and focused response to the follow-up and implementation of the Platform for Action through its advocacy and operational activities in support of women 's economic and political empowerment , and encourages the Fund to provide technical support to operationalize the Platform for Action at the national level through , inter alia , the resident coordinator system , and taking into account decision 1996 / 43 of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme / United Nations Population Fund ;  
According to numerous non-governmental observers , the authorities had usurped the religious sphere , claiming that they alone were in possession of divine truth , and had perverted religion by politically exploiting Islam in order to secure their grip on power and enforce their authority through religious and political persecution and totalitarian methods , in complete contrast to the historically tolerant Muslim heritage of the Sudan .  
On the question of dress , the Special Rapporteur , while emphasizing that traditions and customs , irrespective of their origins , are equally worthy of respect , urges that dress should not be the subject of political regulation and calls for flexible and tolerant attitudes in this regard , so as to allow the variety and richness of Sudanese garments to manifest themselves without constraint .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Although significant progress had been made in the field of human rights , particularly in the eradication of apartheid and the adoption of conventions protecting the human rights of women and children , the enjoyment of political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights was far from being universal , and it was regrettable that the end of the cold war had not brought about an improvement in the situation .  
In discharging its human rights obligations and in its approach to human rights in general , Egypt adhered to a number of principles : the politicization of human rights and their use as an instrument to achieve political objectives must be avoided ; double standards must not be applied to human rights situations ; full account must be taken of cultural differences in the context of human rights issues ; and human rights , including social , economic and political rights and the right to development , were indivisible .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
The Human Rights Committee , after having considered the initial report of Estonia ( CCPR / C / 79 / Add . 59 ) in October 1995 , had expressed satisfaction at the fundamental and positive changes in Estonia , which provided a better political , constitutional and legal framework for the implementation of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
In assuming its complete role , with the completion of AICC construction work , the detention facilities , increased activity with the commencement of trials , and taking into consideration the general political situation of the region , additional security personnel would be required for facilities and access control , armed escort , personal protection and simultaneous courtroom operations .  
The measures imposed on the Bosnian Serb party were suspended indefinitely starting on 27 February 1996 , after the Security Council was informed the day before , through the appropriate political authorities , that , in the assessment of the commander of the Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bosnian Serb forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation established in the Peace Agreement ( letters to States and international organizations , SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2 ) and SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2-1 ) ) ;  
We appeal to the parties concerned to cease immediately all hostile actions , ensure the safety of the lives and property of refugees and innocent civilians and guarantee the smooth delivery out of international humanitarian assistance so as to create conditions for the voluntary and orderly repatriation of the refugees and lay the foundation for a political settlement in the Great Lakes region .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Despite considerable economic difficulties , her Government was determined to preserve those achievements and to bring about economic , social and political renewal based on a market economy , social justice , the rejection of any form of marginalization or exclusion , and the establishment of a durable democratic system .  
Refuting the so-called reliable sources of the Special Rapporteur as being linked to other States or in the pay of the United States secret services , the representative of Iraq said that the accusations concerning the violation of the political and civil rights of the Iraqi population by means of laws imposing cruel and inhuman penalties , which those sources had reported , were totally groundless since those laws had been repealed , as the Centre for Human Rights and other international bodies could confirm .  
BOHAYEVSKY ( Ukraine ) said that the international protection and promotion of human rights could be effective only if it was based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
Adopting a presumptuous , arrogant and biased approach to the question of human rights , pursuing double standards or politicizing the issue in a deliberate attempt to provoke political confrontation would harm the promotion and protection of those rights .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Given the increasing interrelationship between political , economic , social , military and cultural factors in conflicts , the concept of peacekeeping had been modified and had acquired a multidimensional and integral character .  
While it was neither desirable nor feasible to adopt inflexible procedures for all peacekeeping operations , such operations must be guided strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular , respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs .  
It is committed , independent of extreme events , to combat racism and xenophobia over the long term , producing publications ( brochures , posters and pamphlets ) every year on symbolic dates such as 21 March ( International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ) , 3 October ( German Unity Day ) and 10 December ( Human Rights Day ) , suggesting action to be taken , engaging in public relations , through statements in the press , on current topics , and submitting petitions and claims to political bodies .  
Planning to meet requirements and the design and erection of decent and socially acceptable lodgings represents an extremely complex and expensive task inasmuch as , to cope with the problem of refugees arriving in unpredictable numbers , with major peaks , account has to be taken of economic possibilities and of the limited land areas and premises available , while also avoiding conflicts with the population and among the refugees themselves and taking into consideration local political interests .  
The economic crisis , on the one hand , and the identity crisis , on the other , are aggravated by the claims of people of French stock to ascendency over naturalized French citizens and immigrants ; hence the reference to the theme of national preference , with its xenophobic and even racist content , in political speeches .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
The Government and Brazilian society were resolved to work together to ensure full enjoyment of civil , economic , social and cultural rights , as well as political freedom , which was essential to improve the standard of living of the population .  
Regrettably , where alleged violations of minority rights occurred , political means were frequently resorted to and there was an insufficient use of judicial protection mechanisms at the national level , which should be exhausted before any recourse was had to the relevant international organizations .  
REZVANI ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) said that regional institutions and instruments played a key role in the promotion and protection of human rights , and were capable of reflecting regional political , social , cultural and economic factors .  
The Chinese Government , while committing itself to the promotion of economic development , had strengthened the country 's democracy and legal system , with special attention to economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights .  
The civilian component of the mission , acting under the broadened political mandate thus granted to my Special Representative , has assisted in bringing together various segments of the population in an effort to promote mutual understanding between communities , monitor human rights and ease political and inter-ethnic tensions within the country .  
These expressions of concern notwithstanding , an active electoral campaign was conducted by all major political parties , including those that had boycotted the second round of parliamentary elections held two years ago .  
Nevertheless , the period of time covered in his report ( A / 51 / 457 ) was very long and many of the matters referred to had already been resolved , as reflected in reports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Central America and on the progress made in the political , economic and social fields , particularly by the efforts to improve the judicial system , public security mechanisms and human rights institutions .  
The purpose of the United Nations internship programme is to promote among the participants ( usually students enrolled in a graduate school ) a better understanding of major problems confronting the United Nations ; the programme also provides departments , at Headquarters and elsewhere , with the assistance of outstanding young students specializing in a relevant field , such as economics , social affairs , international law , international relations , human rights , political science , or public administration .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Also commends the work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women in providing a strategic and focused response to the follow-up and implementation of the Platform for Action through its advocacy and operational activities in support of women 's economic and political empowerment , and encourages the Fund to provide technical support to operationalize the Platform for Action at the national level through , inter alia , the resident coordinator system , and taking into account decision 1996 / 43 of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme / United Nations Population Fund ;  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
There could be no peace without development , and peace could not be based solely on economic and political agreements between Governments ; rather it should be based on mankind 's intellectual and moral solidarity , which in turn was based on the cultural dimension that transcended national borders and promoted mutual understanding .  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work closely with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the peoples of Afghanistan ;  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Rejects coercive extraterritorial measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women and the elderly ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
He wondered why the United States Government used double standards , accusing some countries of human rights violations , while turning a blind eye to those committed by some of its allies and ignoring the thousands of political detainees and shielding the killing of unarmed women and children and the occupation of foreign territory as it made use of its veto .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,

Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
" Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,

During the Habitat II process there was renewed political commitment to the implementation of new or revised national shelter policies based on the enabling approach , as there is growing recognition that better policies not only improve housing conditions but also increase the impact of the housing sector on local and national economies .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
CHAVES ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that desertification and drought were global problems caused by the interaction of topographical , biological , cultural , political , social and economic factors . 
" Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , " Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;

Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work closely with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the peoples of Afghanistan ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

While it remains committed to its decision , taken in response to the proposal of the governments of a number of friendly countries , notably the Russian Federation and France , to give political action a chance to remedy the situation with respect to the unlawful no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , the Government of Iraq has sought to inform you of the facts of the matter so that the international community may be aware of the dangers posed by the continued maintenance of the no-flight zones to security and peace in the region . 
On behalf of the authorities of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been forced to leave their native place , allow me to express our deep gratitude to the United Nations , the Security Council and personally to you , Your Excellency , for the tireless efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia , Georgia , in particular , for the firm and clear position taken by the United Nations towards the illegal parliamentary elections held by the present separatist leadership on 23 November 1996 .  
Another view was that the concept of crimes in international law was well established and that for acts of exceptional gravity such a characterization with its legal , moral and political dimensions and negative and condemnatory connotations was quite appropriate .  
Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara . ( c ) ) or the requirement not to derogate from basic human rights , had been generally well accepted .  
Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .  
With regard to the fact that the rules on reservations to multilateral treaties had been elaborated with the purpose of reconciling two sets of interests ( the need to ensure the universality of a treaty by maximizing participation by States with diverse cultural , economic and political conditions , and the need to preserve the integrity of the treaty ) , it became evident that universality should not only be numerical but also substantive .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
His delegation supported in part the approach followed by the Commission in its previous sessions , namely , to retain only those crimes whose gravity could not easily be contested , as well as crimes of a clearly political nature which posed a threat to international peace and security and therefore to exclude crimes , such as piracy , trafficking in women and children , racial discrimination , recruitment of mercenaries and foreign intervention .  
The observation of the Special Rapporteur in paragraph 68 that " a great reluctance of the international community to use the term ' genocide ' " is not rooted , as the Special Rapporteur would like it , in the alleged " reluctance " but in the fact that such a position is contrary to international law , while the prevailing practice of certain political bodies and some United Nations Special Rapporteurs to invest genocide with arbitrary definitions has been politically motivated .  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
While retaining its great ability for political and financial mobilization and intensive , joint work with Governments , UNICEF , under the excellent leadership of Ms . Carol Bellamy , and with a renewed mandate , is focusing on supporting Government efforts to settle outstanding issues , consolidate the gains that it has already achieved and work more effectively to meet present and future challenges . 
The extension of UNAVEM 's mandate until 28 February 1997 will provide the Angolans with an additional chance to accomplish the remaining military and political tasks foreseen in the Lusaka Protocol and to establish the basis for a peaceful , united and prosperous Angola .  
A comprehensive approach to education for human rights , including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and recognizing the indivisibility and interdependence of all rights , as defined by the United Nations , shall be adopted for all activities under the Decade .  
In order to enhance their effectiveness , human rights education efforts for the Decade shall be shaped in such a way as to be relevant to the daily lives of learners , and shall seek to engage learners in a dialogue about the ways and means of transforming human rights from the expression of abstract norms to the reality of their social , economic , cultural and political conditions .  
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
According to its statute , the members of the Commission were elected , not on the basis of political representation , but so as to represent the main forms of civilization and principal legal systems of the world , in addition to which its members must of course individually possess the requisite qualifications of competence in international law .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
As I left the region , attention was already shifting from the humanitarian crisis to the political situation in Zaire and its potentially turbulent effects on an already fragile and volatile region ; hence the repeated calls by all the African leaders for the absolute need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Zaire . 
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
Hence , at this critical stage , my delegation deems of utmost importance the respect for the principal provisions of the peace accord , such as cooperation with the International Tribunal , leading to the arrest , extradition and trials of those responsible for atrocities ; the resettlement of refugees to their homes of origin , free from harassment and discrimination ; the rapid establishment and functioning of the new political institutions ; and respect for the arms-control provisions of the peace plan .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The Conference identified as a major catalyst the political will of the leadership to champion the cause of scientific and technological development in Africa and to provide it with appropriate policies , financial and other resources and an enabling environment .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .  
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
The constant growth of crime , with its dangerous new forms and transnational dimension , in many parts of the world represented a destabilizing threat to fundamental social , economic and political institutions , especially of those countries in transition , and endangered international security .  
PASHAYEV ( Azerbaijan ) said that drug abuse , illegal drug trafficking and crime were increasing at alarming rates and had serious political , economic and social implications for countries , particularly the newly independent States , which had been confronted with problems resulting from aggression , large numbers of refugees and displaced persons , economies in transition and a geographical situation favourable to drug dealers .  
In that context , she felt it was important that the terms " organized " and " transnational " crime should not be used to describe controversial political ideas , but restricted to agreed social and legal dimensions .  
The Government of Guatemala reiterates that the incorporation of URNG in the political and legal life of the country , under conditions of security and dignity , is in the national interest , given that it is directly related to the objective of reconciliation and the consolidation of a democratic system open to all , and to the contribution of all Guatemalans in building a prosperous country , a just and equitable socio-economic system and a multicultural , multiethnic and multilingual nation ,  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
Ukraine had always supported the creation of an international criminal court and was ready to participate actively in the future work , in the hope that the international community would demonstrate enough political will to meet what was an historic challenge .  
It had been agreed , in the preliminary exchanges of views , that the Working Group 's visit could with advantage be preceded by a preparatory visit so that , firstly , the Group could more easily take cognizance of certain constraints , political or technical ( for example the problem of distances ) , facing such a visit and to have a better understanding of Chinese law , in particular with regard to the difficulties entailed in bringing it into conformity with the international instruments on human rights .  
The remaining issues could be divided into two categories : the procedural or technical ones could be addressed during the nine weeks of further work recommended by the Preparatory Committee ; and the substantive issues requiring high-level political decisions could be finally resolved only at the conference .  
His delegation recognized the major technical difficulties involved in the constitution of such a court , which involved striking a careful balance between procedural concepts and political interests , and ensuring that both the procedural rights of the accused and the right to justice of the victims and the international community were taken into account .  
Although his delegation acknowledged that the obstacles to its inclusion were more political than legal , it considered that the task assigned to the Preparatory Committee and the court itself would be incomplete if such a core crime were not included in the statute of the court .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
They also have been asked by many States engaged in democratization to help encourage and facilitate the active participation of citizens in political processes , and to foster the emergence of a productive civil society , including responsible and independent communications media .  
Traditionally , technical assistance has been provided in the context of economic and social development , with the main emphasis on building and strengthening physical infrastructure and the executive arm of the Government ; assistance in governance beyond that was made virtually impossible by the political climate throughout most of the United Nations history .  
Such a culture is built upon a societal consensus not about policy , but about the process and framework of democratic political life : that the will of the people is the basis of governmental authority ; that all individuals have a right to take part in government ; that there shall be periodic and genuine elections ; that power changes hands through popular suffrage rather than intimidation or force ; that political opponents and minorities have a right to express their views ; and that there can be loyal and legal opposition to the Government in power . 
The reality is that no State can long remain just or free , and thus also have the potential to pursue a successful and sustainable development strategy , if its citizens are prohibited from participating actively and substantially in its political processes and economic , social and cultural development .  
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
Legal , economic , political or cultural barriers that prevent the exercise of equal rights should be identified and removed through comprehensive policy reforms and strong affirmative action ;  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
Cuba considers that the unfair and unequal international political and economic order , underdevelopment , the unequal distribution of income among countries and within countries and , in some cases , the actions of other States and the implementation of measures of coercion are also responsible for the outbreak and continuation of internal conflicts and the suffering they cause .  
In Cuba , freedoms and fundamental political , economic , social and cultural rights are established by the Constitution , as is equality of rights , and they are all provided for in the main legal texts in force .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
The world community must send a clear signal to the warring parties immediately to halt all hostilities , refrain from the use of force , set aside their differences and engage in political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation , a lasting political settlement to the conflict and the establishment of a completely representative and broad-based transitional Government of national unity .  
The new , restructured MINUGUA will oversee an unprecedented transformation in the political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security life of Guatemala .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
The cooperation between UNHCR and SADC will focus , inter alia , on the social , economic and political issues in the southern African region that have a bearing on the root causes of forced population displacement , refugee protection , provision of humanitarian assistance and the search for durable solution .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
It recognized that the Declaration on the Right to Development constituted an integral link between the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action through its elaboration of a holistic vision integrating economic , social and cultural rights with civil and political rights .  
In retrospect , the victories of the people , first against the political sleight of hand to stop the elections , and then against the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare away the voters from the polling booths , seem to have left the reactionary forces in our country with only one remaining avenue to their objective , the unconstitutional overthrow of any civil Government , and that was precisely what happened on 25 May . The people of Sierra Leone have responded to the coup in a manner unique in the history of Africa .  
With the improvement of the international political climate , the dangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are receding , while prospects for taking concrete steps on practical disarmament are improving .  
Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of its armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest possible level and of ensuring its independence and national security primarily by political and diplomatic means .  
The agreement expands cooperation to new fields , such as preventive diplomacy , the maintenance and consolidation of peace and , pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50 / 3 , all subjects of common interest in the political , economic , social , scientific and cultural fields .  
Many times during the biennial conferences held since 1986 the Heads of State and Government of countries that use French as a common language one country out of four in the world have recognized the role of multilateralism in the new international context and confirmed their will to help find a solution to global political and economic problems .  
In preparing for the special session the Governments of Member States should demonstrate their political will in practical terms by intensifying their efforts to eliminate poverty in general , eradicate absolute poverty , increase employment and decrease unemployment and by deepening social integration in their respective countries .  
The General Assembly would express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the OIC and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two Organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ; and would express the hope that the Secretary-General will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two Organizations .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
The Bucharest document identified an almost universal recognition that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to political , economic and social problems .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
In keeping with this view , the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that democracy is not a model to be copied but a goal to be attained , and the pace at which it can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture and society .  
Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
Efforts to experiment with introducing new forms of democratic process to provide people with a choice of their elected representatives at the municipal or local level in certain countries deserve our notice and appreciation , if we are sincere about recognizing different historical traditions in the evolution of democratic political practice .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
In his annual report on the work of the Organization ( A / 52 / 1 ) , the Secretary-General considered that post-conflict situations have special requirements and that successful recovery from disturbances caused by conflicts is assisted by facing up quickly to general development challenges , and the provision of appropriate legal frameworks , stable social and political environments and economic opportunities .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
In the spirit of Olympic ethics , any form of discrimination racial , religious , political , linguistic or otherwise is totally excluded , and the fundamental principle of equality prevails .  During the last three millenniums the Greek people have remained wholeheartedly and deeply committed to the Olympic Ideal , founded on the noble principles of understanding , tolerance , solidarity and dignity .  
In our view , special attention should be paid in the charter to the security interests of States that have not joined military and political alliances and have not expressed the desire to join such alliances in the foreseeable future .  
The time has come for us all to display the necessary political will and determination in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive set of measures which will lead to the creation of a Security Council which is transparent , democratic , accountable and thus credible and legitimate .  
Escaping this state of mind and building a new world based on cooperation and the rule of law requires not only political will , but careful planning in order to foster confidence and to mitigate economic , security and social concerns at national and regional levels .  
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
The prolonged cycle of violence and hostilities , as a direct consequence of Israel 's continued illegal occupation of Arab territories , has brought tremendous political , economic and social sufferings and hardships to the people of the region , including the loss of human lives .  
It has been recognized in all international legal and political forums that East Jerusalem is an organic part of the West Bank occupied since 1967 and that the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , applies there , as do the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
It is now three years and two months since the restoration of constitutional order enabled the Haitian people bravely to take up again the task of creating a State based on the rule of law and a democratic regime capable of ensuring increasing respect for the political , economic and social rights of all citizens .  
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
Reviewing the past and looking to the future , people throughout the world are anxiously waiting for the establishment of a just and equitable new international political and economic order , and they are hoping to see lasting peace and prosperity for all in the coming century .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
Member States have an ongoing commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law , which are founded on total and mutual respect for the territorial integrity and political systems of other States and non-interference in their internal affairs ; the non-use of force ; and the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiations .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
With sufficient political will and the coordinated implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , as well as international cooperation in creating an enabling environment , full employment remains an attainable goal .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
At the Social Summit , heads of State or Government committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of mankind .  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
The " parliamentary elections " took place as scheduled and were followed by a second round on 7 December , despite numerous calls by the international community for them not to take place until the conclusion of an agreement on the political status of Abkhazia that respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
Whereas building a democratic , multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , with social justice , calls for equitable participation by all citizens , both men and women , on the basis of complete political and ideological pluralism ,  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
Factors contributing to this deficiency include lack of political will , unavailability of sufficient financial means , lack of full understanding of the exact obligations of the instrument , and the compressed time schedule of many negotiations , which may leave room for multiple interpretations of the agreed text , and this may give rise to potential disputes .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .  
If local action is the basis of sustainable development , future decisions on political and economic resource allocation at the national level will need to give priority to supporting local authorities .  
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
In particular , he stressed the need for fundamental political rights and freedoms to be protected during the electoral campaign , if the elections were to be recognized as free and fair .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
This national undertaking calls for an implementation strategy that sets realistic priorities for gradual fulfilment of the various aspects of the Peace Agreements as and when the political , institutional , financial and technical bases for their implementation are established ,  
Since time immemorial , Zairian women have played a vital role in society , a role which has altered as the country has passed through the social , political and economic changes that have marked the successive eras of its history .  
On the political level , active public life was generally closed to them , apart from a few isolated cases of women rulers5 and others who played a part in " town hall " discussions of social issues .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
The Declaration includes a commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
The Special Rapporteur thus deeply regrets the fact that the States which had formed the nucleus of this multinational force were forced to break off their concerted efforts , after spending weeks setting up a base at Entebbe ( Uganda ) , owing to the lack of sufficient political support from the international community and to Rwanda 's repeated opposition to the undertaking .  
The input of the United Nations University ( UNU ) to the preparatory process included international conferences on world cities and urban future , and human settlements in the changing global political and economic processes .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
According to official and non _ government observers , the destruction of Babri Masjid was an incident , an aberration , the result of the political exploitation of religion by ultra _ nationalist political parties , and can not be interpreted as evidence of an official policy of religious intolerance directed against Muslims .  
In actual fact the authorities were combating the development of a militant Sikh terrorist movement campaigning for a separate and autonomous Sikh state , which had first appeared in 1978 ; it was financed by the Sikh diaspora ( and even by Pakistan ) and was using religion to secure the support of Sikhs and as an easy means of whipping up their passions in favour of a purely political cause .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
India 's political commitment to unity in diversity , by which it seeks to make viable a democracy covering a subcontinent and embracing a society which is multireligious and multilingual ( and therefore differentiated , diversified and complex ) is certainly an example which the country is offering to humankind and which reflects a mode of democratic organization of society based on respect for and viability of diversity , particularly in the field of religion .  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
He emphasized the fact that , owing to the deleterious effects of transborder crime , international cooperation against it had become the fourth major area after political , economic and military cooperation .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
This Government is necessary not just because it will symbolize the participation of all political parties represented in the Parliament , but because it establishes an important starting point for efforts to strengthen still fragile balances and constitutes a special forum for joint action that can help the taking of decisions devoted to the common management of national affairs .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
With sufficient political will and the coordinated implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , as well as international cooperation in creating an enabling environment , full employment remains an attainable goal .  
It becomes more sensitive and complicated when it relates to the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif Jerusalem which has a unique political status and represents the spiritual patrimony of three religions and is closely linked to deep religious feelings in the Islamic world .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of the objectives of the Convention is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
The future is contingent on global economic developments as well as on local and national social , cultural , political and economic initiatives .  
In addition , it exceeded the mandate of a human rights working group by recommending detailed social , political and economic programmes at the national and international levels , and guidelines for international cooperation , some of which were not directly linked to the impact of structural adjustment programmes .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
Constant dialogue among the main social , economic and political actors will be necessary in order to move forward effectively on such basic issues as land , taxation , justice , public security , decentralization , local development and multiculturalism .  
FLNKS believes that the local partners in the Matignon Accords should also be in a position to resume bilateral discussions on the country 's institutional future before the whole range of political groups , social and professional categories , and traditional institutions is associated with the approach advocated by FLNKS .  
It encompassed detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which had been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
However , my Special Representative and all observers concur that , at this time of renewed violence and growing political and social tension , the situation in Haiti is more precarious than it was four months ago , when the authorized strength of the Mission was considered a minimum .  
The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
The serious consequences of the sanctions and the embargo imposed on Iraq have aroused widespread international concern in official , political , legal and civic circles .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Stressing that , in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to eradicating poverty throughout the world through national action and international cooperation , taking account of the fact that this is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
Noting that the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has highlighted the imbalance in the special rapporteur system by referring to the fact that although there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the recognized interdependence , indivisibility and interrelationship of the two sets of rights ,  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
The purpose of turning their bimonthly meetings into a political / technical seminar , with the participation of the Commission 's and Iraq 's scientific and technical experts , has been to narrow the major outstanding issues to a manageable quantity .  
The UNSCOM 168 team undertook preparatory work for the December political level talks which included interviews of personnel involved in the storage , movement and destruction , and in accounting of proscribed missile assets declared to have been secretly destroyed in 1991 .  
In view of the grave consequences of a possible intensification of military confrontation , the Polish delegation shares the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his report that it is necessary to increase and coordinate international efforts to impress upon the Afghan parties the need to solve the conflict in a peaceful way , that is to arrive at a lasting political settlement with the participation of all segments of Afghan society .  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti , as reflected in particular in the holding of five elections that culminated with the presidential elections of 17 December 1995 , which permitted the first transfer of power between two democratically elected Presidents , and takes note of the partial parliamentary elections held on 6 April 1997 ;  
Again urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees , to cease all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres , and to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary police or prison custody where family members and lawyers can visit them , and that such persons receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
While the United Nations has been successful in its humanitarian intervention , it has been less successful with the establishment of local political and social institutions capable of taking over for the State institutions destroyed in the civil war .  
The unbridled power struggle is thus nourished by rivalries among the leaders of various clans and by their unquenchable thirst for political power commensurate with their moral and religious domination of the members of their respective communities .  
If a serious political dialogue is re-established among the main Somali factions , we sincerely hope that a national reconciliation package will include the following measures : respect for human rights , and an end to the appalling situation still prevailing in the country ; the establishment of , and strict adherence to , the rule of law ; the creation of a national army and a national police force ; and the promise of elections , whenever feasible , to ensure the primacy of democracy .  
As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
The Convention envisages that , to be effective , this equality must be achieved within the framework of a political system in which each citizen enjoys the right to vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot , in such a way as to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate , as provided for under international human rights instruments , such as article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Women are rarely appointed to these senior or influential positions and while their numbers may in some States be increasing at the lower levels and in posts usually associated with the home or the family , they form only a tiny minority in decision-making positions concerned with economic policy or development , political affairs , defence , peacemaking missions , conflict resolution or constitutional interpretation and determination .  
Measures that have been adopted by some political parties include setting aside for women a certain minimum number or percentage of positions on their executive bodies , ensuring that there is a balance between the number of male and female candidates nominated for election , and ensuring that women are not consistently assigned to less favourable constituencies or to the least advantageous positions on a party list .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
In its decision 1996 / 117 , the Sub _ Commission decided to request Mr . Osman El _ Hajj to prepare , without financial implications , an expanded working paper on ways and means of promoting democracy , how democracy can ensure economic , social , cultural and political rights and how to overcome obstacles to democracy , and to present the expanded working paper to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
The Slovak party has informed representatives of the Commission of the European Union as well as the States members of the latter on all legislative , legal and internal political aspects relating to the preparation and subsequent conduct of the referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , including the fourth question on direct presidential elections which proved to be invalid from the legislative point of view .  
The Mission continued to stress the need to plan the short , medium and long-term phases of this complex process , bearing in mind the political , technical and social implications of the reform .  
At a moment when the fragility of the ambient political , social and economic context is placing additional pressures and burdens on the recently laid foundations of the key institutions that underpin the rule of law , the continuing presence of MICIVIH remains essential to the consolidation of democracy . 
The section prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex , race , colour , nationality , religion , political opinion , social or family status or other similar circumstances .  Notwithstanding the fact that this principle was , before the Act entered into effect , considered to be one of the unwritten basic principles of administrative law , it was deemed necessary to enact an express provision to this effect .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .  The Sub-Commission should look into the possibility of establishing an international trust fund for the rehabilitation of the survivors of population transfer .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
This is both a theoretical and political challenge as these rights were formulated in a context that was totally different economically and above all politically : the post-war period , the cold war , the existence of a socialist bloc and of competitive capitalism based on strong nation states .  
A strong , almost visionary political will would allow the implementation of article 2 of the Covenant , wherein each State Party undertakes " to take steps , individually and through international assistance and cooperation , especially economic and technical , to the maximum of its available resources , with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant " ( . . . ) .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
We firmly believe that the meeting of the two leaders would signal the start of the necessary process of healing the deep psychological and political trauma left by more than 20 years of bitter internal conflict .  
We sincerely hope that the Angolan Government , and UNITA in particular , will , in the fundamental interests of the people of their country and in a continued spirit of unity and cooperation , seize the historic opportunity to complete as soon as possible the pending tasks in the political and military fields and achieve national reconciliation at an early date , thus paving the way for national reconstruction and development in the country .  
We urge the Government of Angola , and in particular UNITA , to make haste and complete the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process , including the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory in accordance with the agreed timetable and procedures ; the transformation of the UNITA radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility ; the registration and demobilization of all remaining military elements ; the elimination of all obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods ; and the disarmament of the civilian population .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
After extended discussions during which the relevant institutional and political actors sought to identify potential solutions to this problem , the Government decided to promulgate a decree establishing a temporary legal mechanism which would extend special documentation facilitating access to pension benefits .  
Reaffirming that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political progress , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ,  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
Upon the initiative of the respected leader , a proposal was made in August 1981 to hold a Conference for the Promotion of National Reunification , with the participation of the representatives of the political parties and organizations from the north , the south and the overseas compatriots and to convene a joint conference in February 1982 to be attended by 100 persons , including politicians from the north , the south and overseas .  
The implication that incitement to violence and violence itself is a legitimate and understandable response to political differences is irresponsible in the extreme and can only be considered complicity in the repeated deliberate attempts to escalate artificially violence in the territories .  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
Take note of the Preliminary Agreement on a National Reconciliation Pact , which is the outcome of a broad consultation of those representing the vital forces of the Central African nation , thereby embodying the solemn commitment of the political parties , the trade union federations and the civil society to respect the constitutional legal order and to lend full support to all initiatives to promote dialogue and national reconciliation ;  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
We are all aware that the Government and people of Haiti bear the principal responsibility for the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of the country , but we also know that , if long-term peace and stability are to be attained , it is indispensable that the international community make a sustained commitment to cooperation .  That is why we are present here today .  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
The main lesson that we should draw from the limited success of past efforts in this regard is that the legal , political and practical complexity of the issues involved makes it impossible to apply ready-made , generalized solutions .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
Difficult and painful reform lies ahead if Albania is to succeed in fostering political and social reconciliation , economic development , consolidation of a fully functioning and independent judiciary and electronic media , and the creation of active civil-society institutions .  
We believe that the Albanian operation has set a significant precedent for potential future interventions by the international community in cases where a State is gripped by a complex crisis with serious humanitarian implications and political repercussions for its neighbours .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through the debate on the report , the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as to set priorities in the context of the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
The General Assembly acknowledged that " to maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide " ( A / S-19 / 29 , annex , para .  39 ) .  
Urges Governments and non _ governmental , national and international organizations to collect and disseminate gender _ disaggregated statistics and indicators to monitor the representation and participation of women at all levels of political , economic and social life , with special attention to the impact of the multiple barriers faced by many women who exist at the intersection of discrimination , based on race , gender and poverty ;  
As a result , the aim of the Funds political empowerment programme is to address the obstacles and challenges that prevent women from contributing their vision to a new world of equality , development and peace and from participating in its construction under the framework of universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated human rights .  
If in the near future an assessment , even preliminary , of the danger level for the climate system was successfully concluded , it would be easier to adopt a political decision regarding quantitative targets on reduction and elimination of greenhouse gases and to consider the outline of a protocol or other legal document containing the obligations of the parties to the Convention beyond the year 2000 .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
It is incumbent upon that organization to show to the international community , through practical , credible and trustworthy deeds , that it has indeed demilitarized , that it no longer claims and controls any portion of the country 's territory , that its radio broadcasting system is complying with Angola 's laws , and that it has truly become a genuine political party . 
Whereas the date of 27 July 1997 had been accepted by the Congolese political community as a whole , represented within the National Commission responsible for the special administrative census , and by the prospective candidates in the presidential elections , in a solemn commitment signed on 31 May 1997 under the auspices of the Director-General of UNESCO , Mr . Federico Mayor ,  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
Honduras pressed ahead with the cleansing of its political system , and Panama continued the process of broadening national consensus around the goal of a successful management of the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
Reiterating that many citizens who took part in the armed rebellion against the Republic of Croatia have sought and been granted Croatian documents , and that they have by this act accepted all the rights and obligations that derive from Croatian citizenship , including respect for and defence of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia , and that they have accepted the Republic of Croatia as their homeland and have expressed the wish to be included in its political , economic and social life , and in that way to contribute to its prosperity ,  
The Programme shall be implemented in particular but not exclusively , in the following fields : political , legal , administrative , internal affairs , economic , social , cultural , educational , reconstruction and return and the media .  
In the light of the foregoing considerations and taking into account the dynamics and political importance of the subject , we have decided to instruct our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to maintain a broad dialogue on the issue , taking into account the regional interest , and to seek an understanding on the subject .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
With the advent of the twenty-first century , we now face an historic choice as to what kind of a world we should bring to the new century .  The Chinese delegation holds that the international community should work to establish a just and rational new international political and economic order to ensure global and regional security .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
Singapore believed , however , that the guiding principles which would allow for the application of international law without the exercise of political influence and afford States , large and small alike , a level playing field , should include those principles that prohibited discrimination , coercion and reneging on previous agreements as well as those that encouraged the open and candid exchange of information and discouraged misinformation and the introduction of irrelevant considerations .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility for securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .  
Change was the sole constant epitomizing the reality of today , and extraordinarily rapid and dramatic internationalization was bringing profound social , political and economic change .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
In the context of widespread rumours about arrests , executions and disappearances , and of the evacuation of their nationals by several embassies , numerous persons affiliated with FUNCINPEC , BLDP and KNP , including senior political , military and police officials of those parties , parliamentarians , leading activists and supporters , as well as affiliated journalists , reported threats and intimidations and expressed fears for their lives and safety .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
The autocrat was barred by ill health from governing , the Kengo Government had fallen into disrepute , the people were bewildered and disillusioned and the political class was discredited . 13 The Catholic bishops stated on 4 January that , in order to hold on to power , members of the transitional institutions were resorting to demagogic manoeuvres , such as lies , deception and corruption , and refusing to bow to popular sovereignty . 
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
The study might also include ( a ) knowledge about human rights among the general population , as well as potential target groups ; ( b ) social , political and economic conditions relevant to human rights education ; ( c ) human rights educational access for marginalized groups ; and ( d ) treatment of human rights issues by the mass media ( including television , radio , newspapers and popular magazines ) .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the draft Mining Code provides that activities in the Area " shall be carried out under such conditions that the workers employed in such activities are afforded adequate protection against discrimination in employment on the grounds of race , colour , sex , religion , political opinion , national extraction or social origin , as well as in the fields of occupational safety and health , labour relations , including freedom of association , conditions of work , social security , employment security and living conditions at the worksite " . 
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
Referring to the meagre share of LDCs in world trade , the dwindling ODA flows and the staggering debt burden , he called for a renewed and broad-based political consensus on the part of the international community to reverse the growing marginalization of these countries .  
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
In its resolution 51 / 30 G of 13 December 1996 , on assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia , the General Assembly noted with concern that political instability and the absence of central authority continued to characterize Somalia and that , while the environment had become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , in others the humanitarian and security situation had worsened .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The court should be impartial and independent , complementary to national criminal justice systems but not subordinate to them or to any national or international political body .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
But it goes beyond a mere series of defined activities , combining political , economic , legal , social and environmental measures within a common framework .  
Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields , and expresses the hope that he will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two organizations ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee equally will need to play a more active role in several respects : assessing the degree to which the needs of the internally displaced are being met by the United Nations system generally as well as in specific situations , calling upon other United Nations agencies to play strong supporting roles in the humanitarian effort , pressing for political action to resolve the crises that create humanitarian emergencies and drawing attention to situations that receive insufficient attention .  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women . 
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
The strategic framework for Afghanistan proposes a more holistic approach by the international community , whereby the political efforts of the United Nations inform , and are informed by , the international community 's social , economic and humanitarian priorities .  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
It has also had a deleterious impact on the body politic , weakening further the authority of the State , eroding the little confidence enjoyed by the executive and the legislative branches and increasing public disillusion and cynicism vis - - vis politicians and political parties .  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Again urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees , to cease all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres , and to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary police or prison custody where family members and lawyers can visit them , and that such persons receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards ;  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
It should be borne in mind that the expanded verification role of MINUGUA covers a package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and URNG , which include detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which are bound together into a national peace agenda . 
A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
The financial situation of the Agency was becoming more disturbing with every year that passed , and in that connection the European Union called on the international community to provide maximum political and financial support to the Agency and to give it sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its tasks until a just , lasting and comprehensive solution had been found to the political problems which had led to the appearance of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East . 
The regulation on certain issues of State information policy of January 1996 , mentioned above , in addition to specifications regarding registration , placed the regional and district press under the direct control of the local political administration , with local executive committees being empowered to approve editors-in _ chief who themselves become members of the committees .  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .  
Given that terrorism posed a stumbling block to worldwide social , economic and political development and was , moreover , a violation of human rights , concerted international efforts should be made to eliminate it .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through its debate the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as for priority setting by Member States in the context of major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
At a time when the precarious nature of the political , social and economic climate is exerting increasing pressure on the foundations of the key institutions on which respect for the rule of law depend , it is more necessary than ever that the international community continue and step up its assistance , and contribute , by its presence , to consolidating democratic institutions in Haiti . 
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
It is symbolic that a representative of a renewed democracy which is living through a period of fundamental social , economic and political reforms , has become President of the General Assembly at a time when the issue of United Nations reform tops its agenda .  
During the next 12 months , we have to cope with a vast agenda covering a broad range of political , economic , social , disarmament and humanitarian issues , as well as legal , administrative and budgetary ones .  
Respect for human rights is achieved not only through the functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with international treaties but also through political , social and economic measures that allow human rights to become an integral part of social development and a part of the everyday life of each individual .  
Despite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of members of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past few years to contain the devastating effects of the conflicts in the Arab Gulf region , which has great importance to regional and international strategies , and their continuing endeavour to support progress towards joint reconstruction and cooperation , the unstable political and security conditions in the region remain a source of concern for us .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
In this respect , the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international drug control , which is to be held in June 1998 , will provide us with an excellent opportunity to renew our political commitment by closing our ranks against illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for progress in preventive efforts .  
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
By engendering social and racial harmony based on a political compact , we have been spared many of the traumas experienced by less fortunate countries and we were thus able to achieve our development goals in relative peace and tranquillity .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .  
The tragic events in former Yugoslavia , the crises and convulsions on the territory of the former Soviet Union and elsewhere , the emergence of aggressive nationalism as well as populism in Central and Eastern Europe , as an appealing remedy for political problems , economic difficulties and social tensions , are vivid reminders of the critical , sometimes lethal , nature of these challenges .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
More attention should be given to appropriate and timely preventive measures , because we believe that early measures adopted by the international community are the ideal way to avert the outbreak of conflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessary political and military measures in the aftermath of the conflict let alone imposing half solutions that are often unfair .  
Here again it must be recalled that the combined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU and the lucid and commendable actions of President El Hadj Omar Bongo , President of the Gabonese Republic and also of the international mediation committee , have , unfortunately , not managed to find a political way out of this grave internal crisis , the prolongation of which is a serious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
In this way , we can avoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are irrelevant to such interests , but affect narrow regional calculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues of international peace and security .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
Yet while today it is the Congolese people who are hostages , perhaps tomorrow it will be another people 's turn to be taken hostage by a political class that is driven by selfish ambitions , unprepared to accept the rules of democracy and uninterested in seeking and maintaining peace .  Every day and at an increasing human cost , the excessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of others defer to a later date the establishment of conditions for a negotiated peace .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
This will enable the Organization to meet the daunting challenges of economic development faced by our global community and those posed by the political and ideological differences afflicting nations today .  
It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
Convinced of the need effectively to tackle the problems confronting them in this area , they have committed themselves to creating an economic , social , political , cultural and ecological environment that is conducive to social development , as well as to giving priority to national and international policies and initiatives aimed at eliminating poverty , promoting employment , combating unemployment and fostering social integration .  
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
While it is true that responsibility for social development lies , first and foremost , with States themselves , which have the right and duty to implement appropriate policies to achieve that objective , it is no less true that this responsibility must be assumed , in a spirit of solidarity , by the international community as a whole , not just because of moral and political requirements that are broadly shared today , but also because of the enlightened self-interest of us all .  
The Summit \ x { e5b8 } future-oriented outlook , as reflected in the Declaration \ x { e5b8 } principles and goals , was a commitment to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development , which , in addition to the principles I have just referred to , called for full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
The Nicaragua Declaration , signed one and a half months ago , strengthened the process of regional integration and laid the foundation for a possible political unification of the Central American countries , and it further enhanced Central American social , economic and trade policy .  
All national development efforts need a vision a focal point to make coordinated and sustained improvements supported by political will , the participation of the people and solid organizational and financial backing .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
The World Summit for Social Development organized two years ago in a post-cold-war international environment characterized by profound social , economic and political changes and increasing globalization represented a milestone in the history of international cooperation .  
The purpose was to begin to create a new human being with stronger moral values and principles , a human being who is more tolerant of differences , more productive economically , with ideals , loyalty and virtue in political matters and embracing social unity ; in sum , to try to alter elements that are deeply rooted in a population , as well as those that are emerging .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
Also , as the Secretary-General has noted elsewhere , the transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting the fulfilment of even national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
During the Security Council debate of 14 August 1997 on the conclusion of Operation Alba , many delegations described it as a model , including the following aspects : unity of intent by the group of countries involved ; decisive , prompt action taken by the Security Council ; a very clear mandate ; definite limits on the time-frame ; rapid planning and deployment ; and in-depth political coordination and consultation among all the parties involved , with none excluded , through an ad hoc steering committee .  
The resolution calls for a report that is more easily directed to assessing the way in which mandates of the General Assembly have been fulfilled over the past year and setting priorities for the period ahead in the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial areas .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
This problem is of particular significance to Korea , as numerous Korean cultural objects have been pillaged and illegally transferred abroad during our country \ x { e5b8 } history of political turmoil , especially in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century .  
Sound political logic and balanced reasoning are required from all of us , primarily with regard to the pivotal equation , that is , finding the golden mean between the level of representation on the reformed Security Council and the imperative need to ensure its effectiveness .  
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
The operative part recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as a mechanism for coordinating and harmonizing regional efforts to achieve economic , social , cultural , environmental and political integration .  
However , the Dominican Republic is aware that the stability and creditability of a democratic system does not depend on willingness alone , but on a wide range of political , economic , social , cultural and environmental factors .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 51 / 146 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and to promoting the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
Crises require a coherent and effective international response , a response that should integrate preventive diplomacy , political mediation and humanitarian relief , but also social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication . 
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
This peace was pursued on the basis of the mutual recognition of the legitimate rights of both peoples and their desire to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and a historic reconciliation through the agreed political process .  
The mutual recognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 , the signing of the Declaration of Principles and the subsequent withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and some areas of the West Bank , as well as the establishment of an elected Palestinian Authority , were historic milestones along the road to peace that the international community encouraged and nurtured with political and financial support .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
This session is confronted with the onerous task not only of pointing to the imbalances that have emerged since Rio between the advances in political and economic reforms achieved in the third world and the clearly diminishing resources to fund sustainable development , but also of securing a renewed commitment , with firm assurances , to stronger financial aid .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
The political process of establishing and maintaining sound long-term development policies tends to be most successful when the Government has a strong legislative position , visionary leadership , and a united economic policy team .  
In the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , 5 it is acknowledged that the family plays a key role in social development and , as such , should be strengthened , with attention to the rights , capabilities and responsibilities of its members .  Both call for creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
But equality of rights is not yet reflected in everyday life , owing to the slow pace of sociological and political change , resistance from the controllers of capital , clashing economic interests and the resultant widespread violence .  
Furthermore , it was noted that unbalanced international political relations were often an important factor in the occurrence of mass exoduses through the threat to use force or interference in a country 's internal affairs , as was happening in the case of Iraq , where direct or indirect interference by the United States of America and some of its allies was creating tension , encouraging some of the population to leave , particularly for neighbouring countries .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
This youth policy is coordinated on an inter-ministerial basis and involves two major non-governmental organizations : the National Union of Syrian Students ( with a membership composed of students in universities , postgraduate studies and higher and intermediate institutes ) and the Revolutionary Youth Union ( with a membership of over 1.5-million composed of young workers , rural youth , students with both political and non-political backgrounds , including social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic and artistic . 
In section II of the Manila Declaration adopted by that meeting ( see A / 51 / 293 , annex ) , youth were affirmed the right to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , educational , cultural , spiritual and moral life as partners in the development of society .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
Several key areas of concern were identified , including clarity of procedures , dual criminality , especially in relation to complex crimes , the political offence exception in a modern context , problems relating to the rule of speciality , conflicting claims of jurisdiction , non-extradition of nationals and differences in evidentiary standards and burdens .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
Optimism , combined with an awareness of the enormous task ahead , will be necessary in creating an environment in which the people of Guatemala are able , among other things , to exercise their legitimate civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Her Government 's approach to advancing gender equality was based on the recognition that gender was a factor in the nation 's current social , economic , cultural and political systems and that the unequal status of women had its genesis in and was perpetuated by systemic causes . 
He has expressed regret that agreements reached without the participation of the people might postpone the transition to 1997 ; he has pointed out that confidence in the political classes has been lost because of their failure to implement the directives of CNS and that , during the first 8 months _ out of a total of 24 _ of the extended period , only one of the prior requirements for elections has been satisfied , namely , approval of the Law on the establishment of CNE in an atmosphere of complete national indifference . 
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
It identified three key conditions for success : a fair and credible political framework ; an efficient and well-planned electoral operation ; and adequate support from the international community .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
The Independent Expert observed the progress made with regard to civil and political rights , identified weaknesses in the justice system and public security and drew attention to the need to find lasting solutions to problems affecting economic and social rights .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
The European Union is aware of the challenge ahead for Nicaragua 's new administration , which faces an extensive programme of social and economic reforms , already embarked on by the Government of Mrs . Chamorro , that is only achievable with the consensus of the political groups and with parliamentary agreement between the party in Government and the opposition .  
All Sudanese citizens living in areas controlled by the Government of the Sudan are potential victims of human rights violations and abuses , regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic origin or social status , once they are considered to be opponents of the Government of the Sudan , or even suspected of being in disagreement with its political agenda .  
According to reports received in January 1997 , besides the practice of summoning suspected political opponents to the security headquarters every day early in the morning and releasing them late in the evening , night _ time summoning to the security headquarters became a constant feature in Khartoum and other major northern Sudanese towns during the second half of 1996 .  33 .  On 15 August 1996 , 65 civilians and active and retired officers were arrested in Port Sudan .  
On 21 September 1996 , the Vice-President of SLORC , Gen . Maung Aye , is reported to have declared that the military could remain in power longer if elements receiving foreign support caused disorder and on 25 September 1996 , the NLM indicated that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would soon be charged with political crimes as she was conspiring with former colonial powers and aiding exiled dissident groups in a plot to overthrow the Government .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .  
More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Attention was drawn to the frequent emphasis placed by international forums on the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
The effort has attracted strong and high _ level political support from a large number of countries ; it is overwhelmingly supported by the public , leading NGOs and a growing band of senior military figures .  
Housing , being the most important single investment in the life of the majority of the world 's population , should not be considered only in its aspect of physical shelter , but should be given full consideration as the most important element of family life where all social , economic , cultural and political activities begin and are sustained .  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
Those documents contain many factual clarifications and rebuttals of the allegations and fabrications , totally unsubstantiated by any material proof , which the Special Rapporteur included in his previous reports and which he is still reiterating for political reasons the main aim of which is to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national leadership .  
The Government of Iraq resorted to the imposition of a tax on travel as a purely administrative and financial measure that was not intended to impede travel by citizens or discriminate between them on political or social grounds ; it was necessitated by the situation brought about by the iniquitous economic embargo imposed on Iraq .  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The experience of countries which have chosen the challenging road to sustainable development , democracy and human rights , and which are already beginning to enjoy the fruits of this decision in the form of interrelated economic progress , political consolidation and social stability , proves that human rights are not only noble ideas .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work closely with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the peoples of Afghanistan ;  
The representative of Ireland , speaking on behalf of the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Stressing that all members of the international community shall fulfil , jointly and separately , their solemn obligation to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind including distinctions based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ,  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political as well as other fields and the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all these rights and freedoms in practice .  
The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Stressing that all members of the international community shall fulfil , jointly and separately , their solemn obligation to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status , and stressing the paramount importance of achieving international cooperation to fulfil this obligation , according to the United Nations Charter ,  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .  
Emphasizing the priority that attaches to implementing specific measures to establish mechanisms that will facilitate the attainment of the practical objectives of building a democratic State ruled by law , based on political pluralism , the market economy , supremacy of the law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
The integration of Azerbaijan and Georgia , which are an integral part of Europe , into the European institutions will create broad opportunities for resolving political , economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems on the basis of universally accepted European standards ;  
The measures to prevent and control the phenomenon , which need to be elaborated and implemented at the national and international levels , cut across the economic , social , cultural , political and legal fields .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti , as reflected in particular in the holding of five elections that culminated with the presidential elections of 17 December 1995 , which permitted the first transfer of power between two democratically elected Presidents as well as , more recently , the partial parliamentary elections held on 6 April 1997 ;  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Again urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees , to cease all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres , and to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary police or prison custody where family members and lawyers can visit them , and that such persons receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards ;  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
While the United Nations has long experience in implementing humanitarian programmes during periods of peace , conflict and post-conflict situations , it should be emphasized that the humanitarian programme pursuant to resolution 986 ( 1995 ) is unique and is being implemented within the context of a sanctions regime with all its attendant political and commercial dimensions .  
In view of Egypt 's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation , we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti , and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors , namely , elections , economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister .  
And yet , in the light of the precarious security situation and the lack of a functioning judicial system , compounded by the climate of political instability , more should be done if the international community \ x { e5b8 } hard-won achievements are to be made irreversible .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
Jordan also supported resolution 51 / 210 , in which the General Assembly had renewed its affirmation that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstance unjustifiable .  
The technological advances that were often readily available to potential terrorists called for a higher degree of political cooperation , and new challenges would undoubtedly emerge that would require innovative legal approaches and techniques to meet them , and joint efforts with other international and regional bodies . 
A list of the 27 agreements of continuing validity , current as at 27 November , appears in annex I . Taken together with the provisions of the Croatian Constitution , those agreements , for which the Government of Croatia has made itself internationally accountable , provide a comprehensive political and institutional framework of guarantees , which , if fully implemented , will allow the people of the region to exercise freely their rights and obligations as equal citizens of Croatia . 
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Terrorism had been clearly and definitively rejected by the international community because it violated the most basic of human rights , the right to life ; because it mutilated , tortured and violated human minds and bodies ; and because , with its underlying morbid and fascist philosophy , it aimed to paralyse social , political and cultural life and to obstruct the normal exercise of rights and freedoms .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
He reaffirmed his Governments view that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ; it opposed the specific reference to Jerusalem which had no effect on issues of sovereignty and prejudged the final political arrangements in territories that could be determined only by the direct negotiations to which the parties had committed themselves .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
As a single united Government of Angola takes up the daunting task of providing all Angolans with the political stability and economic development which they have so long awaited , it is our sincerest hope that a successful transition to democratic pluralism will replace , once and for all , the violence and mistrust which have historically marked relations between the Government and UNITA .  
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
Its portrayal of these problems , however , as being such that they can not be solved through a technical process only and as requiring a major political solution is incorrect and contradicts the conclusion drawn in paragraph 46 that not much is unknown about Iraq 's proscribed capabilities .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the medicines they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq .  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the drugs they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq . 
While the situation within that country has stabilized to some degree , owing to the deployment of the multinational protection force and to the efforts of various humanitarian agencies , it is anticipated that the restoration of political , economic and social order will take some time , even after the election that is planned for late June .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
The United Nations Security Coordinator formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Organization on current and potential security-related problems and is responsible for coordinating , planning and implementing inter-agency security and safety programmes and for acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation . 
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
While recognizing the ongoing informal consultations between some administering Powers and the Special Committee , those administering Powers should re-establish their formal cooperation with the Special Committee , facilitate the United Nations visiting missions to the Territories under their administration to provide adequate up-to-date information on political , economic and social developments in their respective Territories with particular emphasis on their constitutional , political and socio-economic evolution towards exercise of the right to self-determination ;  
While there is no commonly accepted definition of what good governance , or " capable " government , means in operational terms , at the very least it signifies the existence of a stable and relatively open and transparent political framework that is representative of , and responsive to , the will of the people .  
An enabling environment , understood in its broadest sense , encompasses the whole panoply of national and international policies , measures and institutions in the economic , social , legal and political domains that influence or affect the growth and development prospects of a country .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
In light of the Committees view that further efforts are required to ensure that the Convention is used as a political tool and a framework for action on behalf of children , the Committee recommends that future national and local programmes of action on children incorporate policies , programmes , aims and goals reflecting the principles and provisions of the Convention .  
A solid legal and contractual basis is being established for Russian-Ukrainian interaction in the political , economic , scientific and technological and humanitarian fields .  
The Presidents reached agreement on the main tasks for further developing and deepening Russian-Ukrainian ties , and stated that the paramount task was to ensure the practical implementation of the provisions of the new general political Treaty signed during the visit .  
I should like to call your attention to the fact that , during the initial 180-day period the Memorandum of Understanding has been in effect , the representative of the United States of America in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) has deliberately obstructed and delayed the processing of contracts in the Committee for odious political reasons inimical to the people of Iraq .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
In fact , it should be evident that in our forum , political realism and a diplomatic approach constitute the fundamental essence of any aim and , consequently it would be advisable , albeit without denying the full respect of each national position , that adequate room be left for a free comparison of different theses in order to find a minimum common denominator on which the best solution for the successful attainment of our endeavours can be arrived at . 
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
Shall we simply say that we engaged in endless debate , encompassing plenary meetings , informal plenary meetings , open _ ended consultations , and meetings of regional and political groups and other impromptu gatherings too numerous to mention ? 
On the subject of refugee status being granted to women fleeing female genital mutilation as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in her final report , note should be taken with satisfaction of the initiative taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in September 1996 when it assembled the representatives of 16 Western countries in Geneva to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for awarding refugee status to the problems specific to women and which differ from the generally recognized forms of political persecution .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights . 
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has also stated that equal attention and urgent consideration should be devoted to the realization , promotion and protection of both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
In its resolution 4 ( XXXIII ) of 21 February 1977 , the Commission on Human Rights stresses the responsibility and duty of all members of the international community to create the necessary conditions for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights as an essential means of ensuring the real and meaningful enjoyment of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
The scope of this report is too narrow for a detailed description of the numerous serious violations of rights of all kinds , whether civil and political or economic , social or cultural , considered either collectively or individually .  
It was erected into a system of government and applied for about a century accompanied by violations of human rights , both economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
These causes should be addressed in a coherent , well-planned , coordinated and comprehensive manner with political , social , economic and developmental instruments .  
The report says that a change of this magnitude requires a package of measures that combine : ( a ) the strengthening of tax administration ; ( b ) the expansion of the tax base and the revision of the principal taxes ; and ( c ) the creation of a team that is committed to reform , supported at the highest political level and backed by a solid social consensus .  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
Also deeply concerned about the rising illicit cultivation of narcotic crops and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs , which pose the main threat to the political , economic , social and cultural structure and stability of the region ,  
However , in complex or overtly political situations , such as Cambodia , southern Sudan , northern Iraq and the former Yugoslavia , special arrangements were put in place on a case _ by _ case basis , including the designation of a lead agency to coordinate the international humanitarian response .  
Injustice , political oppression , human rights abuses , social and economic inequalities , and the absence of democratic freedom and development opportunities are often part of a complex mix of underlying factors contributing to conflict . 
The phenomenon of protracted and growing displacement , warfare that targets civilians and demolishes communities , and the disintegration of political , institutional and economic structures in crisis countries all point to the need for a better understanding of crises and their adverse impact on vulnerable communities .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
The Ministers acknowledged the actions undertaken by the organs of the Community to implement the decisions and recommendations that had emanated from the Conference of Heads of State and Government and from the Council of Ministers , in conformity with the general guidelines contained in the Constitutive Declaration and the Statutes , in order to promote cooperation in the cultural , economic , social , scientific and legal / institutional fields , as well as to enhance political and diplomatic coordination .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The process of achieving peace requires the building of confidence , political reconciliation based on peace agreements among all States of the region , peaceful relations among all peoples in the region , economic cooperation , as well as eventual arms control and disarmament regimes where priority is assigned to systems that experience has proven to be destructive and destabilizing .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Urges Governments and non _ governmental , national and international organizations to collect and disseminate gender _ disaggregated statistics and indicators to monitor the representation and participation of women at all levels of political , economic and social life , with special attention to the impact of the multiple barriers faced by many women who exist at the intersection of discrimination , based on race , gender and poverty ;  
Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .

The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
On the contrary , the international community should provide a coherent and effective response , incorporating preventive diplomacy , political mediation , humanitarian relief , social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .

Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
The political parties bear the mark of mistrust ( they may not join any international organizations ) ; English is introduced as a national language , although unknown to non _ Tutsi ethnic groups ; the problem of the nationality of the Banyamulenge and relocated peoples remains unresolved ; and the Supreme Council of Justice is replaced by a Haute Autorit Judiciaire , headed by the President of the Republic .  
This body would offer the indigenous peoples a window on the world , enabling them to assert their rights , whether civil , cultural , economic , political or social , before the international community .  
The Controller had informed the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in a letter dated 26 September 1997 that the cost of a few additional officers specialized in political , civil and legal affairs would be provided under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1 P-5 , 2-P-4 , 2 General Service and 1 Field Service ) from within approved resources .  
Expresses its deep concern at the prolonged political stalemate , which presents considerable risks for democracy , economic and social development and respect for human rights , and in this regard urges the authorities and political leaders to continue their efforts to resolve the crisis so that the appointment of a Prime Minister may be ratified by the Parliament without further delay ;  
The development process requires a united vision if it is to be sustainable , and it requires joint responsibility on the part of the public and the private sectors to ensure continuity combined with the political stability that strengthens democratic governance .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences105 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Concerned that human rights and fundamental freedoms are not fully and universally respected and continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and that some peoples still lack the full enjoyment of their right of self-determination ,  
Declares solemnly its commitment to the fulfilment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations and as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms political , economic , social , civil and cultural including the right to development . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Despite the efforts of the affected countries and the intervention of the multilateral financial institutions , the crisis had not abated and the potential consequences for those countries included a reduced rate of liberalization ; the possibility that they might seriously consider defaulting on their debt ; the contraction of expenditure , which inevitably meant reduced spending on social services ; and the possibility of widespread social and political upheaval .  
It has continued to implement the good offices mandate vested in my Special Representative by conducting an active dialogue with the authorities and all other major political forces in the country ; encouraging cross-party dialogue and a better understanding among the various segments of the population with a view to easing inter-ethnic tensions ; and promoting the application of international standards of human rights .  
In recent conflicts in Africa , we have also seen abundant evidence of how perceptions of political or historical associations may complicate regional efforts to resolve a conflict , so that direct international involvement , including through deployment of a peacekeeping operation , may be indispensable if peace is to be preserved .  
It was recognized that extreme poverty hindered full enjoyment of human rights and that economic , social , political and cultural rights were universal and inseparable .  
A view was also expressed that a major difficulty lay in the virtual impossibility of distinguishing between unilateral acts aimed at creating a normative legal obligation and those which were purely political in nature .  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
The lack of political commitment was also identified by a few responses , leading to protracted , artificial and unnecessary international negotiations without any concrete results , especially at the field level .  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law ;  
" The Security Council considers that a smooth preparation of free and fair presidential elections , for which proper steps should be taken as soon as possible , requires a certain level of political consensus and the opening of a genuine dialogue between all the constituent parties of the National Assembly .  
The Security Council considers that a smooth preparation of free and fair presidential elections , for which proper steps should be taken as soon as possible , requires a certain level of political consensus and the opening of a genuine dialogue between all the constituent parties of the National Assembly .  
The Assembly decided that the preliminary estimate of resources for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 should therefore include a provision for special political missions , in the amount of $ 86.2-million at revised 19981999 rates , which should be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 ; and that additional requirements shall continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of Assembly resolution 41 / 213 .  
Respect for diversity , for different types of political , social and economic systems , for regional and national characteristics and for cultural , religious and historical backgrounds was a prerequisite for the Declarations implementation .  
As we know full well , current armed conflicts almost always reflect historical accumulations of unsatisfied demands , in most cases aggravated by inadequate social and economic situations and by international political and economic conditions .  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
I would emphasize here , without wanting to be too critical , an occasional lack of understanding in the implementation of adopted policies ; a pernicious role played by local personnel ; supporters of those in power being recruited by the international organizations ; a perceived lack of sensitivity on the part of those who were in charge of certain political and diplomatic aspects ; and perhaps too frequent personnel turnover .  
A strong and independent judiciary is unthinkable in any political system other than a genuine democracy in which there is a clear separation of the three state powers : the executive , the legislative and the judicial .  
When human rights are used to advance one single political agenda while the rights of countless others are ignored , human rights are denigrated , becoming a political instrument of narrow interests instead of a universal standard for the protection of all humanity .  
Over the past year , the Secretariat has continued to work to ensure a coherent , well planned , coordinated and comprehensive approach to conflict situations , which makes use of political , social and developmental instruments .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The reasons for this lack of effective function are many and varied ; common themes include unsupportive policy and institutional framework , a lack of political and community commitment to protection , the alienation of communities from their traditional lands , and lack of capacity associated with the provision of insufficient resources for effective management .  
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .  
Recalling that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;

Deeply concerned , however , about the wide gap that continues to exist between the promise of human rights and their promotion and protection worldwide , and deeply concerned also about denials and violations of human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social including the right to development ,  
Negotiation of a free _ standing new legal instrument dealing exclusively with a transfer ban , even in a fully compatible way with the provisions of the Ottawa Convention , would raise a number of political and legal problems , such as lack of global vocation , setting a precedent by negotiating a partial ban after a clear majority of States has signed a comprehensive one , proliferation of legal instruments dealing with the same content , just to name a few .  
No exceptional circumstance , of whatever kind , whether a state of war or threat of war , domestic political instability or any other exceptional situation may be invoked to justify infringement of these intangible rights : the right to life , the right to physical integrity , the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , the right to a fair trial , the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , and so forth .  
It includes the lack of response to acts of political violence but is also reflected in the almost daily reports of abuses by military and police officials against common people , including killing , rape , illegal arrest or kidnapping for extortion as well as beating and other violent acts .  
Even when political leaders have thoroughly good intentions , human rights norms as expressed in the Constitution and the international conventions need to be underpinned by sound legislation , an effective and independent judiciary and a non-partisan , professional police .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
The Assembly adopted resolution 53 / 168 on the fiftieth anniversary in which it declared its commitment to the fulfilment of the Declaration as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms - political , social , civil and cultural _ including the right to development .  
Technical cooperation activities are based on international human rights standards as defined in the instruments adopted within the United Nations and on international practice in applying them in all regions of the world , giving balanced attention to civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
Such assessments require a political grasp of the clash of parties , values and interests in the mission area , as well as a solid military , logistical and administrative understanding of the risks , costs and means required for operational effectiveness .  
With regard to the international agenda , the pro tempore President of MERCOSUR called for due attention to be paid to existing economic , political and strategic commitments , which should be analysed realistically and objectively in the light of potential costs and benefits which may be generated by either multilateral or bilateral negotiations .  
President Kabbah 's decision to allow the leader of RUF , Corporal Foday Sankoh , to meet with rebel leaders in order to develop a coherent set of political demands , which would form the basis of subsequent negotiations with the Government , is a bold and valuable initiative .  
Factors which give rise to racism and racial discrimination were examined at the seminar on the political , historical , economic , social and cultural factors contributing to racism , racial discrimination and apartheid held at Geneva from 10 to 14 December 1990 .  
The primary causes of racism and racial discrimination are deeply embedded in the historical past and are determined by a number of economic , political , social and cultural factors .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia , by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political and other fields , as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice .  
The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Force was especially demonstrated through demands that an " international military presence " , meaning foreign troops , be accepted even before a political settlement was reached , although the scope and character of international presence had been defined in the agreement concluded between Yugoslavia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
This consensus recognizes the wide diversity of social , economic , environmental , cultural and political conditions around the world and accordingly the need to develop appropriate diverse approaches towards sustainable forest management .  
Their actions may fit into the context of so-called social cleansing operations , criminal activities , illegal crime control , whether organized or not , the securing of economic or political advantages by illegal means , and personal vendettas .  
It was therefore necessary to formulate specific legislation and policies in the legal , economic , political and social fields and , at the same time , to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations and of society as a whole , as well as greater coordination and participation by the specialized agencies of the United Nations system .  In that connection , it was vital to maintain the valuable contribution of UNICEF and of the Committee on the Rights of the Child .  
Not only had India taken institutional , legal and educational measures to strengthen the role of women at the political level , but it had also taken affirmative action to ensure that women filled one third of the seats in all elected local , village and municipal bodies , thereby providing them with the opportunity to exert influence in the formal structures of economic , political and social decision-making .  
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .

The Republic of Colombia is constitutionally defined as a unitary , decentralized and autonomous State , which has a republican system of government and whose legal and political organization is based on respect for human dignity .  
As for the acts committed ( factor a above ) , the historical and evidentiary record suggests cases of murder ( rising to the level of extermination of political opposition ) , forced labour , torture and other inhumane acts .  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
We are convinced that the construction of a reliable system of European security and stability is possible only on a pan _ European basis , in a context of unswerving respect for international law , and using the potential of OSCE as the most representative and universal all _ European organization which can address all the challenges of the twenty _ first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian .  
Human rights are understood to be the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the third generation of human rights set forth in the Constitution , the laws and the treaties in force , together with those contained in the declarations and principles approved by the United Nations or the Organization of American States ( PDDH Act , art .  2 ) .  
Furthermore , the network of the Centre for Initiatives and Advancement for Women , as part of a project receiving financial support from the European Union , is promoting an improvement in the status of women by increasing their active participation in the countrys development and thus affording equal opportunities for women to contribute effectively to national economic , social , cultural and political processes , placing special emphasis on rural areas .  
They also have the right freely to apply their systems of political , social , economic , cultural and religious organization and voluntarily to observe customary practices for the regulation of their domestic coexistence , provided that none of them runs counter to the fundamental rights established in this Constitution .

The bail-out strategies resorted to when a crisis occurred were becoming increasingly problematic : they protected creditors from bearing the responsibility of poor decisions , placing the burden entirely on debtors , tended to encourage imprudent lending practices on the part of international lenders and required such a huge amount of funding that they were reaching the limits of political acceptability .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
The overall situation at the end of 1998 was characterized by continuing armed conflict , the political crisis resulting from lack of agreement on the framework for durable peace , the continuing violations and denial of human rights and the deteriorating humanitarian situation , affected by the absence of international personnel of the United Nations agencies as well as others engaged in humanitarian work , and the reduction of resource flows .  
The declared purpose of the Strategic Framework , namely to enhance the synergy between the political objective of building peace and international assistance activities , and promoting greater effectiveness and coherence of such activities requires a positive and flexible approach and enhancement of resources for humanitarian assistance , not a negative and rigid approach or the reduction of the resources committed to humanitarian assistance .  
Belarus stresses that the use of military force against Yugoslavia without a proper decision of the only competent international body , which is undoubtedly the United Nations Security Council , as well as any introduction of foreign military contingents against the wish of the Government of Yugoslavia , qualify as an act of aggression , with all ensuing responsibility for its humanitarian , military and political consequences .

The five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non _ aggression , non _ interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , and other universally recognized norms governing international relations make up the political foundations underpinning world peace .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
At a time when the entire world is mobilized to create great and viable economic and political groupings to meet the challenges of globalization , Africa should not get bogged down in wars that dismember States that are already greatly fragmented as a result of the politically expedient borders we inherited through colonial laws .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
The Assembly also decided that the preliminary estimate of resources for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 should therefore include a provision for special political missions in the amount of 86.2-million dollars at revised 19981999 rates , which should be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 , and that additional requirements should continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 41 / 213 .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences119 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Given the fact that the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) is a major concern of the global community , the international and national communities have been called upon to support public education and advocacy and to secure the highest level of political commitment .  
The Commission also underscored that enhanced financing of social development requires a strong political commitment by the international community , as well as well focused efforts to mobilize human and financial resources .  
The issue of resources for social development has gained prominence in the countries of the former USSR and Eastern Europe , where the overwhelming economic and political change has proven to be painful , if not traumatic , creating previously unknown hardships among vast segments of the population .  
Some other critical elements include well-functioning legislative and judicial systems , respect for political , economic and social rights , an independent media , use of legal norms , and predictable rules for decision-making and conflict resolution .

The Constitution prohibits the activity of political , trade union and other organizations aimed at the violent overthrow of the constitutional order , the territorial integrity of FRY , violation of the guaranteed freedoms and rights of man and the citizen , or incitement of national , racial , religious and other intolerance and hatred ( art .  42 ) .  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
For many transition economies , the scale of restructuring required by the shift from central planning to competitive markets is so large that the domestic economic , political and social institutions , which are also in a state of transition , are unable to cope with the adjustment costs , which in turn may generate large-scale resistance to reform ( the study of Romania in the current Survey provides a telling example of this ) .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .

Expresses grave concern about numerous instances of violations of human rights , including extrajudicial executions , torture , illegal arrest and detention , and violence in relation to political activities , as detailed in the reports of the Special Representative , and calls upon the Government of Cambodia to investigate urgently and prosecute , in accordance with due process of law and international human rights standards , all those who have perpetrated these human rights violations ;  
This clarification has been made particularly urgent since the international community has been recently exposed to repeated Palestinian arguments claiming that the transitional period will end on 4 May and hence a legal and political vacuum will ensue that should be filled by a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state . 
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;

EU considers these positive developments as a solid basis for a stable process of change of Indonesia 's political , economic and social system leading to a civic society based on democratic principles , the rule of law and internationally accepted human rights standards .  
The Council heard a comprehensive report presented by President Yasser Arafat , in which he discussed all aspects of the political situation and the principal tasks to be accomplished in the Palestinian arena , foremost among which is the successful establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital .  
Every political and popular capability will be mobilized in order to protect Palestinian land , the Palestinian people and Palestinian rights , sustained by national unity and the just and legitimate struggle to reach the single national goal of ending the occupation , exercising self-determination , establishing the State and resolving the issue of the refugees , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) and the resolutions of international legitimacy . 
The Committee reaffirms that the Convention recognizes that womens rights include civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and that they are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between women and men within article 4 , paragraph 1 , of the Convention so as to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and there is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect . 
The CNR agreed ( a ) that nominations to the posts of President , members of Parliament and local governmental bodies be made by political parties or individuals , ( b ) to retain the presidential system for the executive , while proposing ( c ) a professional ( full-time ) bicameral parliament .  
There remains a need to reconcile the widely divergent views held over the exercise of political power and the strategies for social and economic development , in order for there to be favourable prospects for political stability and sustainable institutional and economic development .  
The five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non _ aggression , non _ interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , and other universally recognized norms governing international relations , make up the political foundations underpinning world peace .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations in the Icelandic legal system , similar measures should be taken simultaneously in respect of economic , social and cultural rights .  
While the former provide mainly statistical information and important economic and social indicators , the information gathered from the relevant academic literature , from non-governmental organizations and from the press tends , by its very nature , to be more critical of the political , economic and social conditions in the countries concerned .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
The OIC Contact Group lends its full support to all diplomatic efforts and initiatives in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes under international protection .  
Without prejudging such issues nor the underlying political motivations , the Special Rapporteur believes that the Bill of Rights enshrined in the new Constitution should nevertheless be interpreted as a positive step , provided that it is accompanied by energetic legal and political measures , ensuring that the transition from a de facto emergency regime to a more open and democratic system based on the rule of law .  
In Nairobi , the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by his meeting with Sudanese women of various ethnic , religious and political backgrounds who , within their respective organizations and through the implementation of different projects involving and empowering women at the grass-roots level , are making their own valuable contribution towards the common goal of peace-making and building in the Sudan .

For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences131 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
Despite the recommendations to the Colombian Government to dismantle the system of regional justice and faceless judges , efforts are being made to extend this system so as to continue unfair trials of workers , those who fight for the people , defenders of human rights and political opponents ; simply voicing an opinion that differs from the establishment view is cause enough for being put on trial .  This is tantamount to making social and popular protest a criminal offence .  
WFDY is a broad international non-governmental youth organization which brings together national youth organizations with diverse cultural , religious and social , economic and political systems .  
It is now essential that all relevant political actors in Haiti participate constructively in the electoral process so as to ensure that the upcoming elections are fair , transparent and credible .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
The Council informed Mr . Rugova of its current efforts to solve the Kosovo crisis through a political settlement that would provide for the safe return of all refugees and for substantial self-government for Kosovo within the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and help abate the overheated nationalist sentiments now prevailing in the area .  
Jordans policy targeted the humanitarian dimensions of the refugee problem and focused on satisfying the basic everyday needs of the refugees and on furthering their political and legal rights to return or compensation in accordance with the relevant resolutions .  
It was imperative that the international community , especially the major donors , whether they were States or financial institutions , should not abandon the Palestinian people in such a difficult economic , political and social situation .  
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
The parties expressed optimism about the prospects for expanding bilateral political , economic , commercial , scientific , technical and cultural ties .  
The members of the Council also expressed their support for renewed and urgent diplomatic efforts to reverse this negative cycle on the military , political , security and humanitarian fronts .  
First to re-assert our right to self-determination , which we have demonstrated to you is firmly based on the political and legal rights applicable to all Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list as established by United Nations resolutions and Covenants and international law as determined by the International Court of Justice . . . . 
It had been noted , with respect to the routine empowerment of women in political , economic , social and other fields , that this made strong societies in times of peace and mitigated automatic gender abuse in times of civil disruption .  
It was pointed out , however , that the primary responsibility for implementing the Beijing Platform for Action rested with Governments , and that political will and commitment at the national and international levels played a critical role in creating the enabling environment necessary for equal treatment and gender mainstreaming .  
While noting some signs of greater political freedom in East Timor , these sources reported that East Timorese continued to be persecuted , arbitrarily arrested or routinely harassed for the peaceful expression of their convictions or because they were suspected of supporting the armed resistance .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance to indigenous societies of their lands , territories and resources for their continued survival and vitality .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
Among the core principles of the Africa Partnership are : national commitment and ownership ; political action ; joint national strategic action plans ; mobilization of increased resources ; stronger regional technical platforms for action ; protection of human rights ; compassion and solidarity .  
While they may mean different things to different people , 29 / depending on their philosophical , ideological , political , cultural , social and economic perspectives , all agree that the expression a democratic society referred to in the Universal Declaration and in both International Covenants 30 / is a vital concept for human rights based on common values shared by human beings throughout the world community .  
A democratic society , moreover , whatever may be the cultural , political , social and economic framework in which it is achieved , is identified by certain principles and institutions , such as pluralism , the rule of law , legitimacy , political equality , popular control and public accountability of government , which , again , have their starting point in human rights and freedoms .  
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
Concerning bilateral issues , President Eyadma and President Taylor expressed satisfaction at the excellent relations of friendship , brotherhood , cooperation and solidarity between their two countries and decided to work to strengthen those relations at all levels , especially in the political , economic , commercial and cultural spheres , in the interest of their respective peoples .  
Special leave shall not be authorized for governmental service in a political office , in a diplomatic or other representational post or for the purpose of performing any functions that are incompatible with the staff member 's continuing status as an international civil servant .  
Promoting community development , improving access to security of land tenure , housing and basic services , and fully integrating people living in poverty into economic , social and political life , which are crucial to sustainable development ;  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
It is essential to fight for respect of human rights and norms of international humanitarian law , but solely through political and legal methods on the firm basis of the United Nations Charter and the relevant multilateral instruments .  
It opposed and rejected outright the efforts of the negotiators at the Rambouillet conference and all other forms of diplomatic intervention , even though , after lengthy negotiations , the political settlement envisaged at Rambouillet laid out a future for Kosovo .  
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
Surplus personnel have been disarmed and their identification cards withdrawn ; offices have been arranged by function rather than ethnicity ; senior staff have begun to hold regular joint meetings ; policies for bomb threats and explosion cases have been developed ; security plans for the return season that is beginning have been established ; and some inappropriate political symbols have been removed .  
The report concluded that there were substantial institutional deficiencies and that although further legislative change was required in such fields as employment and criminal and family law , such change alone would not remove the main impediments to the rule of law , which were rooted in the political environment of the court system .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly called for reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter that indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories .  
It was the first instrument in the world to set forth a list of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ( author 's emphasis ) . 
Considering further that the States Members of the United Nations , by adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , reaffirmed their commitment to the observance of fundamental human rights , their faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women , and their determination to promote , in cooperation with the United Nations , the universal observance of civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Since the beginning of its existence as an independent nation , the Argentine Republic has demonstrated , through actions by the Government , the firm political determination to exercise its effective sovereignty in the southern territories and maritime areas inherited from Spain .  
The issue under discussion involves both conceptual as well as empirical dimensions , some of which are already under consideration by the Sub _ Commission and the Commission on Human Rights . 17 / It also involves both categories of human rights , viz . , the civil and political , and the economic , social and cultural . 
As was emphasized at the IDNDR international conference on early warning systems ( Potsdam , Germany , September 1998 ) , effective early warning is a process that must bring together scientific analysis and technical forecasting of a hazard , together with the political decision-making process and the availability of local community capabilities to heed the warning .  
On the one hand , changes in the need for disaster reduction will be determined by the changing patterns of natural hazards , their future potential for association with technological disasters or political conflicts , and shifts in the socio-economic and demographic trends .  
The fragile peace that has now been maintained in the region for five years thanks to the military and political balance that has been established and to the efforts of the international community must not be made dependent on the nationalist ambitions of Azerbaijan 's present leaders .  
Bringing about such reforms poses a formidable challenge in and of itself , but the policy makers task is even more complex since considerable political and social challenges will need to be addressed while waiting for the reforms to yield benefits in terms of rising incomes and sustained growth .  
The chronic fighting and the resultant political uncertainty has exacerbated the human misery of innocent Afghan people , who have already suffered for too long and are the real victims of this endless war .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
As a direct result of decolonization , the gap left by the non-indigenous colonial political powers in those continents has been filled by population sectors whose indigenous ( or autochthonous ) condition is indisputable by any of todays standards .  
These effects also included the extinction ( or substantial reduction ) of their territorial base and undermined their political , economic , juridical , cultural and social order in general , and even their survival as a distinct society .  
It is not the task of the Special Rapporteur in this final report to describe in detail the harsh impact on indigenous peoples of being subjected to a new and totally alien social , economic , and political _ juridical order .  
Grosso modo , the newcomers and their successors imbued ( and imbue ) the land with an essentially patrimonial value , making it subject to exclusive individual appropriation ( and , thus , capable of being passed on to others at the will of the title holder ) , a source of material wealth and a basis for political and economic power .  
The process that took the indigenous peoples lands from them left behind very limited and debilitating alternatives for survival : vassalage ( or servitude in its diverse forms ) , segregation in reduced areas reserved for them , or assimilation into the non-indigenous sector of the new socio _ political entity created without indigenous input .  
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
It is the obligation of the entire international presence in Kosovo and Metohija to strictly respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija , which implies respect for its political , administrative , legal , economic and monetary system and an unhindered functioning of public services in accordance with all Yugoslav laws and regulations ;  
The observer for Romania added that the problem of effective participation of political organizations of national minorities , and the recognition of minoritiy representatives in public affairs , should be included in the final document as an element of international preventive policy .  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Guaranteeing our progress and security as well as that of our children within a status of full political dignity , based on the permanent union between Puerto Rico and the United States , embodied in a bilateral pact that can not be altered except by mutual agreement .  
They constituted steps in a process towards a better understanding of the relationship between human rights and development , and a recognition that economic and social rights are as indispensable as civil and political rights .  
The leaders of the world therefore pledged their political will and their common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries , with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half the 1996 level no later than the year 2015 .  
To ensure an enabling political , social and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and for durable peace , based on full and equal participation of women and men , which is most conducive to achieving sustainable food security for all ;  
The Committee made an important point by emphasizing that in considering sanctions , it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing lite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law , and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country .  
While on the one hand every Government should remove obstacles blocking development within its State , such as failure to observe civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , effective international cooperation is essential in providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development , in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Israel has also sought to fulfil another principle it holds dear , as stated in the Declaration of Independence : Israel . . . will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants . . . based on freedom , justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel ; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion , race or sex .  
Rapid advances in technology , growing awareness of the need to preserve Earth and its environment , the increasing potential offered by space activities for economic and social benefits vis - - vis the urgent needs of the developing countries and the changes in the global political scene during the post-cold-war era are sound reasons to deliberate on the role of space in the development of humanity in the twenty-first century .  
I would like in conclusion to express our readiness and sincere desire to work together with all other nations to build a peaceful world in which all people can live happy and productive lives , free from political , social and economic anxieties .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Thanks to this law , the enforcement and development of a private medical-care system part of the national policy on the population 's medical care will pay special attention to women 's health , which is far more sensitive to social and economic changes and to political , cultural and psychological factors . 
This proactive and resolutely political choice is based on a rejection of all forms of discrimination against women , which is the reason why today women are present in all areas of social activity , including in high-level legislative , executive and judicial posts . 
Despite the fact that it has slowed in many countries , the current rate of demographic growth will , in the coming decades , have a considerable impact on economic , social and even political stability in numerous developing countries which are already enduring serious difficulties .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
The current IMF-monitored economic programme put in place in November 1998 as a follow-up to the 1997 / 98 programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and make further progress in the area of structural reform while the political situation settles , and while a possible new enhanced structural adjustment facility programme is being considered .  
It is recognized that there is a vital link between national stability and economic and social development , and that the provision of adequate and sufficient assistance to Haiti is largely subject to a return to political stability .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
In Rwanda , UNHCR has been actively participating in the Rwandan Womens Initiative designed to promote womens rights and participation in political , legislative and judicial arenas and institutions , as well as equal participation in economic and socio-cultural affairs , and to combat violence and other harmful practices against women and young girls .  
Noting the desire and ardent wish of all the political , economic and social actors in the Comoros to see the country return as early as possible to a normal and stable republican system capable of bringing about economic and social development through the establishment of a new institutional framework ,  
Noting that since only 27.5 per cent of the electorate participated in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 , and the law required 50 per cent participation of registered voters for the results to be declared legally valid , the referendum was accordingly declared legally null and void ,  
The main premise guiding INSTRAWs research area is that womens involvement in urban and rural , national and local politics , as well as their untiring efforts to advance womens causes through the mobilization of civil society , contributes not only to gender equality but also to expanding the boundaries of citizenship , democratization , civil society and political decision-making .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitment by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
Without success in this area it is hardly possible to create the stable , just and democratic political environment which in turn is an indispensable precondition for sustainable human , economic and social development .  
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitments by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
UNFPA has encouraged Governments to remove administrative and political obstacles , increase public awareness through all channels , such as the media , formal and other educational programmes , and engage in continuous collaboration and consultation with non _ governmental organizations .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
This is attributable primarily to the determined efforts of my Special Representative , supported by the Russian Federation as facilitator , as well as the group of Friends of the Secretary-General , in insisting to the sides that continuation of the status quo is not an acceptable option , and in encouraging and logistically facilitating bilateral contacts in the fields of culture , humanitarian issues and economic cooperation , as well as on political questions .  
A primary output of the follow-up to the Potsdam conference will be a specific action plan and guidelines towards an integrated process approach , interdisciplinary and multisectoral , thereby comprising sociological , economical , political , organizational , scientific and technological components .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
This encouragement demonstrated a conscious political will that recognizes the importance of women in this field in particular , based on sound principles whereby equality between men and women is the means and approach adopted and whereby the advancement of women is an eminent objective to be accomplished with the aim of achieving a free and equal society , as is the motivation of women to assume higher political office .  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
The Council reiterates the importance of a stable and predictable political and economic environment for local and foreign investment and other international financial flows , which remain essential for Africa 's economic and social development .  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The European Union commends the efforts of OAU and all those who have supported it in its search for a peaceful solution to the conflict , which has caused enormous human and physical losses in Ethiopia and Eritrea , jeopardizes political and economic stability in the two countries and in the region , and undermines their capacity to attract foreign support needed for their development .  
The meeting assessed the cooperation between the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields as outlined in General Assembly resolution 53 / 8 .  
In order to build a firm foundation for real and enduring peace and security , it was essential to eliminate the root causes of conflict , be they of a political , ethnic , economic , social or other nature .  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
However , as the years passed , the post-war solidarity gave way to the cold war and instead of one unified covenant , those rights were codified in 1966 in two international covenants - one on civil and political rights , another on economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
As a result of this consensus , there is now no more room for promoting one set of rights as against another , or putting forward some rights , such as economic and social , to be fulfilled prior to or in violation of civil and political rights , or vice versa .  
Civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights have been codified in the International Covenants and ratified by a large number of countries , but the Declaration on the Right to Development does not have the status of a treaty and therefore can not be enforced in a legal system .  
It states : The right to Development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Then , there is a process of economic , social , cultural and political development , which is recognized as one in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
Most importantly , as constituent components of human rights , these rights have to be achieved following the human rights approach , with full respect for civil and political rights and , with the effective participation of all concerned , equal opportunity of access and fair distribution of the benefits of development .  
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
Currently , such methodologies are less effective than those developed for civil and political rights , although social and economic data from development agencies is increasingly being incorporated into the relevant analysis .  
For example , guidelines for interviews recently prepared for the Kosovo emergency operation and shared with the partners involved in the field refer to both economic , social and cultural and civil and political rights .  
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The outrage duly expressed by the international community , condemning the Taliban as the perpetrators of these killings , and particularly the special attention given to this tragic event by the United Nations as embodied in Security Council resolutions 1193 ( 1998 ) and 1214 ( 1998 ) laid the political , legal and international groundwork for the investigation of the issue , identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murders .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
The factors driving these conflicts which the Seminar identified showed why internal conflicts clearly predominate : ethnic rivalries , general decline in the rule of law , democratic shortcomings on the part of the political authorities , defective governance policies , poverty and underdevelopment , identity-based political demands , politicization of ethnicity , shortcomings in reintegrating former combatants , lack of access to agricultural land , economic difficulties and other factors .  
They noted the multifaceted nature of the concept , which combines political , ideological , economic , social , cultural and ethical criteria , and identified its main elements , such as transparency in public administration , accountability , respect for human rights and legality , promotion of democracy and enhanced management of resources . 
The persistent efforts of States to achieve political ends that serve their national interests entail the misuse , according to established international norms , of , inter alia , radio and television stations with a view to destabilizing the constitutional order of other States considered to be enemies .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
The trend towards ballistic missile defence would be difficult to reverse because the political support in the United States for its development was considerable ; large investments had already been made and committed to further research and development ; and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was often perceived as an obsolete arms control agreement preventing the protection of the territory of the United States .  
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
UNIFEM is committed to intensifying support for programmes that link micro-level and macro-level practical and policy actions in its three thematic areas to meet emerging needs and priorities for gender mainstreaming and for building the capacity of womens organizations as economic and political actors .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
This demonstrates not only the unanimous agreement of the international community on the urgency for the abolition of these obsolete policies , which have been imposed on the Cuban people for so long , but also the common desire for the development of healthy international political relations , the strengthening of international cooperation for the development of all nations , an irreversible trend of the twenty-first century . 
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The Bureau 's report also appears to overlook the balances achieved in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , reaffirmed the universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights and the need for the international community to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  The Bureau 's report , on the one hand , focuses mainly on promoting civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
The demand for concerted global action is shared across a wide geographical and political spectrum among a very large number of countries , although not all of them are affected with equal severity by the direct and indirect consequences of the illicit arms traffic .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The conference will provide an ideal opportunity for a cooperative partnership to be established among Governments , international and regional organizations and the non-governmental community to mobilize public and political support to address the problems associated with the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
The period under review was marked by continuing negotiations , interrupted by repeated discord , and slow progress between the political parties and the Government of Haiti on how to continue to provide essential Government services , such as police and customs services , and how to further the cause of democracy through the organization of legislative and municipal elections .  
In addition , the office would manage any new United Nations civilian mission , facilitate continuing dialogue among key actors in Haiti and the international community , support the democratization process , help to mobilize international political and financial support for Haiti and provide the political framework and focal point for integrating and coordinating the activities of the international community .  
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
Subsequent to two amendments , the indictment includes some 37 counts pertaining to alleged crimes of , inter alia , persecution on political , racial and religious grounds , unlawful deportation and transfer , murder , wilful killing , torture , rape , inhumane acts , cruel treatment and wilfully causing great suffering .  
During the preparatory process for the Conference to review the Non _ Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , scheduled for the year 2000 , we have seen with concern the increasing lack of political understanding between the parties _ nuclear States and non _ nuclear States _ to the said Treaty as to how to progress in a manner which is effective and satisfactory for all the interested parties towards the securing of the ultimate objectives of the NPT .  
To help bring this issue to a just and lasting resolution , the Chinese Government offers encouragement and support to the conflicting parties in Afghanistan so that they can put the interests of their nation and country above everything else , disregard their ethnic , religious and political differences , stop fighting among themselves as soon as possible and establish a broad-based and stable government acceptable to all sides , on the basis of mutual respect and extensive consultations .  
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
The rights of Afghan citizens are protected under the Covenants on political and civil , economic , social and cultural rights , the Geneva Conventions and other international instruments to which Afghanistan is a party , and they must be respected .  
The sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee , attended by a total of 126 States , have been marked by broad support for the draft convention , strong political commitment and the presence of sound technical expertise .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .  
The future of the University is strongly tied to the political and financial support reflected not only in greater numbers of Governments acceding to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace but also in increasing contributions of financial resources for the normal functioning of the University and the launching of new programmes .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 155 of 9 December 1998 , stressed the importance of creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development at the national and international levels .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
This group of nations with different traditions , cultures and historical experiences was brought together by a shared commitment to democracy and a belief that the promise of economic prosperity enjoyed by all citizens is more likely to be realized in a democratic political environment based on respect of human rights , popular participation and the rule of law . 
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
Guided by the desire to contribute , in its own way , to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation , and in line with its foreign policy aimed at contributing to regional peace and security , as well as ensuring the country 's national security by political and diplomatic means , in 1992 , Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
The Seminar was also to review the political , economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories and to identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in the programmes of assistance and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the political and sustainable socio-economic development of the Territories concerned .  
My own country of Saint Lucia , and our Eastern Caribbean sister State of Dominica , share special cultural , economic and social ties with the overseas departments of Guadeloupe , Martinique and French Guyana , which represents the political model of integrated status and whose representatives have been present with us here at this Seminar to discuss the intricacies of that political status .  
The continued and enhanced role of countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific is critical to the future development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories whose economic , political and social advancement can not be successfully addressed separately from the respective regions of which they are an integral part .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The broad human rights approach to disability , therefore , takes the view of advancing the rights and well being of all people , regardless of disabilities , through promotion of implementation of general and disability-specific international instruments that encompass civil and political to economic , social and cultural rights for all .  
In addition to the increased security and political measures taken by the international community , it is the establishment of the Kosovo Transitional Council and the active involvement , on a consultative basis , of political and local leaders in the executive functions of UNMIK that is expected to provide the most important confidence-building mechanism in the medium term for the improvement of the overall situation in Kosovo . 
We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General for his ideas expressed in the report and for his bold approach to the issues of political and military action in cases of systematic and widespread violations of international law , especially those ideas expressed in paragraph 67 of his report .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
Emphasizing that cooperation in political , economic , environmental , humanitarian and security fields contributes to the common goal of a secure , stable and prosperous Baltic and Black Sea space as an integral part of an undivided Europe ;  
It has established regular meetings with the Ministers of Justice in both entities to ensure that political , technical and institutional impediments to the proper functioning of the judiciary are being positively addressed .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
The Netherlands calls for a coherent and integrated approach to conflict prevention and conflict resolution in which the diplomatic , political , military , economic and humanitarian aspects , as well as development assistance , are treated as integral parts .  
The current political context , however , is unfavourable , particularly since those elected will in all likelihood be disinclined to take part in such a seminar until the elections have been held and parliamentary commissions established .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
The executive bodies of the various nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties constitute concrete examples of existing regional arrangements , but their capabilities need to be augmented and their political role needs to be acknowledged by the international community .  
After admitting that the majority of Cubans support Castro , and that there is no effective political opposition , the author of the memorandum stated that the only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship .  
This Conference , which is part of IPUs action to channel parliamentary support to the United Nations , can be a major milestone in efforts made to enhance the peoples understanding of and support to the United Nations through their elected representatives and in identifying ways of relaying United Nations decisions and recommendations more efficiently at the national political level for their effective follow-up .  
After over three decades of an internal armed conflict marked by extreme cruelty , a conflict which was , among other things , an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance , all the indications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas was going to be a complicated and dangerous process .  
Member States shall enhance the process of political consultations and develop cooperation based on mutual interests in the economic , social , humanitarian , environmental , information , scientific and cultural spheres , with each member State making its contribution under conditions of full equality .  
They believe that respect , protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms contribute to political and social stability and peace , to the enrichment of the cultural and spiritual heritage of society as a whole and to mutual understanding and friendly relations between their peoples .  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
At the political and diplomatic level , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries has enhanced extensive and permanent contacts among the seven lusophone countries , aimed at an effective and coherent approach in the international arena .  
For Latvia to succeed , and for the people of Latvia to have the full opportunity they deserve to live secure , healthy and prosperous lives , Latvia must be integrated into the political , business and intellectual exchange of the global community .  
To promote information , education and communication programmes for social mediators , for example , political , religious , educational , cultural , business and union leaders , peer educators , and representatives of non-governmental organizations and the media worldwide , so that they may convey appropriate and accurate messages about drug abuse . 
In order to create and maintain such political will , it is important to give broad publicity to this issue by widely disseminating relevant information on the subject , including the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting and the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly , and above all by publicizing the costs borne by a few countries in supporting the decisions of the Security Council adopted in the name of the international community as a whole .  
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
At the national and international levels , unjust economic , social and political systems which really constitute violations of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights contribute to the birth and / or nurturing of extremism .  
Nigeria and indeed the entire West African subregion have devoted considerable human , material , political and diplomatic resources to the resolution of these crises in the subregion , starting with Liberia and subsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau .  
To this end the Special Rapporteur welcomes the newly-created Stability Pact of the European Union for south-eastern Europe , which outlines a comprehensive approach to the region and promises the States of south-eastern Europe international assistance and eventual integration into European political and economic structures in return for ongoing progress towards democracy , respect for human rights , and regional cooperation .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
In conclusion , while the efforts of the Council to lend its voice to the efforts to halt the excessive accumulation of and traffic in small arms is laudable , we wish to caution that the underlying sociological , economic and political causes of conflict must be addressed so as to create conditions of stability and thus reduce the need for arms and , consequently , for conflict .  
The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
The internal political climate has stabilized and the country continues to move in a peaceful and orderly fashion towards the legislative and presidential elections scheduled for 28 November 1999 .  
The remarkable developments in the course of history , with the victory of Africa and the United Nations over colonialism and apartheid and the disappearance of ideological confrontation in international relations , have established conditions propitious for work on economic and social development and for the building of democratic political systems .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
We look forward to starting the preparation for the summit , which should adopt a balanced approach between political and economic issues , reflecting the global nature of European Union-Africa partnership in order to ensure concrete results . 
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
The construction is telling proof that the United States Government cares little about the political solution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija , and that its main concern is to occupy part of the sovereign territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and establish a long-term presence in the autonomous province of its constituent Republic of Serbia under the guise of participating in the United Nations security presence .  
Since my seventh report to the Council ( S / 1999 / 788 ) , events in the Central African Republic have been dominated to a large extent by the preparations for the presidential election by the Mixed and Independent Electoral Commission ( CEMI ) , which was assisted by MINURCA and various external donors , the campaign by political parties and the first round of the election , which took place on 19 September after two consecutive postponements .  
Being aware that international migration , particularly irregular migration , has increasingly become a major economic , social , humanitarian , political and security concern for a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region ;  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
More broadly speaking , the Kosovo crisis has made it even clearer that only through a comprehensive international effort - at the political , economic and social levels - will the Balkans be able to move from chronic conflict to stability , development and progressive integration in Europe .  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Emphasis must be placed on the Organizations crucial role in addressing the underlying causes of international political crises , including the right to self-determination for peoples under foreign occupation and alien domination , and in the economic and social fields .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
Many formally independent countries were really in a state of dependence because of a growing burden of indebtedness , dwindling official development assistance , and the negative impact of globalization and market liberalization , all aggravated by the imposition of standard political , economic and social models that took no account of differences in identity , culture , degree of development and the like .  
Since it was essential to consolidate the achievements made by addressing the remaining political and operational issues in a balanced and careful manner , he encouraged the parties concerned to continue their cooperation with the United Nations with a view to creating an enabling atmosphere for the referendum to be held as planned .  
It was even more concerned by the slow promotion and facilitation of self-government and by the fact that the utmost effort had not been made to ascertain the free and voluntary choice of the peoples on the political future of their Territories .  
As the new millennium dawned , Bolivia hoped that the United Nations might soon be able to proclaim a world free of colonial vestiges , free of oppression and economic , political and social dependency and respectful of democratic values and fundamental human rights .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
Governments , vulnerable to the threats of withdrawal from transnational companies and to political pressure from voters who were not prepared to change their lifestyles , had difficulty in maintaining social standards and affording the initial cost of moving to environmentally friendly technologies and behaviours .  
Each actor , whether citizen , NGO , enterprise , State or international organization , respect a holistic and integrated approach and to take into consideration the interdependency of the political , social , economic , cultural and environmental factors of development ;  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
This fellowship programme aims to give participants , in particular mid-level diplomats and national civil servants dealing with international issues , access to comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills , and possibly other related subjects .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
Human-centred development , the concept outlined at Copenhagen , would enable the poor to enjoy basic political and economic freedoms while focusing on practical and effective ways of alleviating their suffering .  
In a context of economic , political and social globalization and an unprecedented technological revolution , half a century after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , it was inconceivable that some countries should be unwilling to fulfil their commitments in that connection .  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
The Ministers emphasize that resolute opposition to terrorists sheltering behind political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic and religious slogans is in no way aimed at discrimination against any one of those causes .  
The Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which were small island Territories , required and deserved the comprehensive support of the international community , which must assist the Territories to fulfil their aspirations to achieve not only political but also economic , social and cultural well-being .  
At subregional level , an Association of Women of West Africa ( currently chaired by Cte dIvoire ) which had been established by countries of the Economic Community of West African States planned to initiate cultural , social , economic and political programmes for advancing the status of women .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,

Emphasizing the importance of the end of a critical period in Central American history and the start of a new phase free from armed conflict , with freely elected Governments in each country and with profound political , economic , social and other changes which have created a climate conducive to the promotion of economic growth and further progress towards the consolidation and further development of democratic , just and equitable societies ,  
In that report , the Secretary-General pointed out that there were a number of special political missions whose resources had previously been provided under the commitment authority granted by the General Assembly to the Secretary-General in its resolutions on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses but whose mandates had been extended with such regular predictability that they could no longer be considered unforeseen .  
If the interpretation is indicative and descriptive , it falls within the purview of sciences such as archaeology , general history , including the history of cultures and civilizations , ethnology , political sociology , social psychology and political philosophy ; if the interpretation is prescriptive , it is a matter for ethics and the moral sciences , philosophy and the legal sciences , international relations and educational psychology .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
To work for the full and timely implementation of the provisions of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and to re-establish the authority of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo throughout its territory , and stresses , in the context of a lasting peaceful settlement , the need for the engagement of all Congolese in an all-inclusive process of political dialogue with a view to achieving national reconciliation and the holding of democratic , free , transparent and fair elections ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
All countries , non-governmental organizations and international organizations concerned needed to be engaged in follow-up , and in that endeavour different methods of implementation , monitoring and evaluation that were sensitive to local cultural , political and religious traditions might be required , as well as active participation of the local population .  
If torture was practised in a State other than in very occasional instances , that meant there was a problem in the body politic and , therefore , in the body administrative ; correcting such problems required firm political will and considerable resources .  However , even though a long-term effort might be necessary , sight should not be lost of the urgency of eliminating torture .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Expresses deep concern about the reported extensive campaign of wiretapping against the independent media and opposition political figures , and calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia to ensure that the media and opposition political figures and parties are not harassed or hindered in their actions or intimidated by government actions and are guaranteed the same protections as representatives of the media or political establishment who are favourable to the Government ;  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Following a brief introduction of the subject by the Chairman-Rapporteur and the independent expert , Ms . Anne-Marie Lizin , the first meeting of the workshop was devoted to a general discussion focusing on three major topics : sociological and political aspects , causes , types and situations of poverty ; the title of a possible draft declaration ; and the main orientations of a possible declaration .  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
Emphasizes that while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests and objectives of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The same perspective was defended during the preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the April 1995 preparatory seminar that constituted a debating forum on the situation of women : the realization of their civic and political rights ; their economic , social and cultural rights ; their reproductive rights and so-called new rights , inter alia , the right to development and quality of life .  
This early positioning for political advantage has taken place in a worsening political climate marked by increased polarization and intolerance , a rise in reports of threats and of acts of intimidation and harassment and continuing mutual mistrust between the political actors and between the latter and the Government , as well as repeated outbreaks of street violence , some undoubtedly politically motivated .  
There were several reported attempts to disrupt the activities of emerging or newly constituted groups , the most egregious example of which was the disruption by pro-Aristide demonstrators of a rally , on 28 May 1999 , organized by the private sector and supported by a wide spectrum of civil society organizations and political parties to protest mounting insecurity and what they termed anarchy .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The creation of a new relationship between Government , society and indigenous peoples must be based on respect for their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and on peaceful dialogue .  
Mr . Wehbe ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that his delegation viewed draft resolution A / C . 3 / 54 / L . 8 , which advocated abolition of the death penalty , as a flagrant violation of the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States and of non-interference in their internal affairs .  It represented an attempt to force other States to change their political , judicial , social and cultural structures .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity in the peace and security , political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
His delegation reaffirmed its full support for the principles of objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity and its belief that since human rights were indivisible and interdependent , equal importance must be devoted to economic and socio-cultural rights and to civil and political rights .  
Pakistan was concerned by the reference in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( A / 54 / 36 , para . 60 ) to the fact that the Working Group on Common Indicators , established by the United Nations Development Group , was developing civil and political rights indicators to complement existing economic and social indicators .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
It also has an idea of the roots of the problem and has made attempts to address the three key areas of access to justice through changes in the legal and judicial system ; promotion of the democratic process by introducing electoral and other reforms ; and strengthening local communities by trying to initiate dialogue and attempting economic and political empowerment .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
In a pessimistic scenario , increased pressure for an expanded role would undercut the WTOs already precarious level of political support , threatening existing international openness .  
Being the most obvious concrete public organization to hold accountable for the consequences of the otherwise acephalous international trading system creates an obvious potential for political discomfort .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
The idea that the political leaders of developing countries might be able to make use of the WTO to advance shared interests is radical , but the idea that civil society might find in the WTO a vehicle for pursuing interests , which are defined socially rather than nationally , is even more so .  
Since core labour standards are really about protecting the right to organize , and even minor and sporadic international pressure on behalf of this right would be a boon to third world labour movements , established political elites are likely to see core labour standards as a threat to both their local power and the economic strategies that they have adopted in response to globalization .  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were mutually reinforcing , and the international community had a responsibility to ensure a holistic approach to the protection of human rights and the elimination of poverty , one of the most urgent human rights challenges .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Governments had expressed their determination to advance the negotiations , but the political will had been insufficient to put aside the purely economic and commercial interests and give priority to the potential risks that living modified organisms represented for health and for the conservation of the planets biological diversity .  
It not only affected those who were subject to its direct indiscriminate attacks , but it posed a real threat to international peace and security , and endangered the political process in the international arena , including the peace process in the Middle East .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
Urges States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , inter alia , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating those rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Supports the efforts by the High Representative and the multinational Stabilization Force in accordance with the Peace Agreement and subsequent Peace Implementation Council Declarations , to weaken the continued political and economic influence of remaining parallel nationalist structures obstructing the peace implementation ;  
Many countries were unwilling to sustain the increasingly heavy financial , political , environmental and social burdens that resulted from accommodating vast numbers of refugees .  
The National Programme for Sustainable Development , which is being prepared , includes the social , demographic , economic , environmental , educational , ethical and strategic and political aspects of sustainable development , and is aimed at the definition of guidelines for the general development of the country to emphasize the right of every individual to his or her own dignity and development , in accordance with international conventions signed by the Republic of Croatia .  
The development process requires a certain degree of political stability , peace and security at the national , regional and international levels , as well as the establishment of fair and equitable economic relations between States and solid international cooperation , aimed , inter alia , at helping the poorer States to boost their economies and give effect to the right to development .  
The problem of external debt , structural adjustment programmes , economic globalization , unequal access to commercial markets , the collapse of basic commodity prices and speculation in hard currencies are obstacles to development and are detrimental not only to the political independence of developing countries but also to their economic and development policies and their ability to forecast the evolution of their economic situation at the national and international levels .  
New Zealand is firmly committed to the universality and indivisibility of human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued , so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example , in the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
To work for the full and timely implementation of the provisions of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and to re-establish the authority of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo throughout its territory , stressing , in the context of a lasting peaceful settlement , the need for the engagement of all Congolese in an all-inclusive process of political dialogue with a view to achieving national reconciliation and the holding of democratic , free , transparent and fair elections ;  
Strongly supports the efforts made to enable the people of Haiti to express their political will in the forthcoming legislative and local elections , invites all the political leaders of the country to involve themselves in a constructive dialogue , and in this connection , invites the Government of Haiti to ensure the necessary political and security environment for the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the schedule recently announced by the Provisional Electoral Council ;  
Expresses deep concern about the fact that commitments by the Government to improve the freedom of the press have remained unfulfilled , and reaffirms the need for free and independent media and to provide to all political parties equal access to all forms of media during the forthcoming electoral campaign ;  
Expresses deep concern about the reported extensive campaign of wiretapping against the independent media and opposition political figures , and calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia to ensure that the media and opposition political figures and parties are not harassed or hindered in their actions or intimidated by government actions and are guaranteed the same protections as representatives of the media or political establishment who are favourable to the Government ;  
Supports the efforts by the High Representative and the multinational Stabilization Force in accordance with the Peace Agreement and subsequent Peace Implementation Council Declarations , to weaken the continued political and economic influence of remaining parallel nationalist structures obstructing the peace implementation ;  
Socialism had different related meanings : it represented an intellectual trend based on the critique of the developing bourgeois society ; it was the expression of a political and social movement aiming at reforms , influence or power ; and it referred to an ideal economic and social system intended to replace and overcome capitalism and its perceived flaws .  
This new development , and the co-evolution that resulted between the two families of historical national economies the capitalist and the socialist deeply influenced and modified the three other dimensions ( intellectual , political and normative ) of socialism inherited from the previous century .  
In these trajectories , interdependent phenomena of political change , institutional shift , macroeconomic trends and social tendencies have generally reinforced each other and produced specific configuration of cumulative causation processes .  
In such a process , all elements of the economic system , of the juridical sphere and of the political regime undergo profound transformations , while social differences are reshaped , cultural values are modified , and the international environment also changes .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
The main thrust of Namibias national action programme to combat decertification was that the social , economic , legal and political environment should be reconciled with the natural environment in order to enhance the sustainable use of natural resources .  
Not only should the existing status and role of the Committee in the formulation of political and legal principles governing space activities be preserved , but its functions of coordinating and regulating international cooperation in space should be strengthened .  
He is also of the view that the dedicated protection of selected United Nations personnel undertaking operations at locations where intimidation and resistance is likely , would provide the confidence essential for more effective police operations and legal proceedings against entrenched political and criminal interests .  
The Mexican Government , which accorded high priority to promoting the full participation of women in social , economic , political and cultural life on a par with men , devoted significant resources to programmes designed to eliminate poverty using a gender-specific perspective , and to training women in non-traditional activities ; it was also encouraging independent employment and the creation of microbusinesses , in view of regional , social and gender realities .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to pursuing all possible steps to ensure that women had full enjoyment of their basic human rights and were equal partners in shaping the economic , political and social life of the country .  
The interviews with political , military and police authorities , public officials , accused persons , witnesses and victims of the attacks , and members of the public chosen at random in Havana , formed a body of first-hand material as a basis for as thorough and objective an investigation as possible into the subject assigned to the Special Rapporteur .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments are all based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
These grounds are : sex ; marital status ; religious belief ; ethical belief ; colour , race , ethnic or national origin ( which includes nationality or citizenship ) ; disability ; age ; political opinion ; employment status ; family status ; or sexual orientation .  
Ms . Faetanini ( San Marino ) said that the General Assembly , at its twentieth special session , had stressed that drug supply and demand were closely linked and had placed the drug problem in its true perspective by emphasizing its social , economic and political implications .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of both civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights .  
The ambitious intention to transform the Council into a more representative , more democratic , more open , more transparent , and hence more effective body makes for an extraordinarily complex and delicate task that requires effort and time , enormous patience and firm political will from all participants in the exercise .  
The note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
More broadly speaking , the Kosovo crisis has made it even clearer that only through a comprehensive international effort at the political , economic and social levels will the Balkans be able to move from chronic conflict to stability , development and progressive integration in Europe .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
The preservation and extension of its achievements , coupled with revitalization of the moral authority and political relevance of the United Nations in the coming millennium , require restoration of the fundamental purposes and principles of the United Nations , as well as a rational , transparent and participatory process of reassessment of the existing institutions .  
But the more usual reaction to the mismatch between economic geography and the political geography of state boundaries has been defensive or a sterile triumphalism : a new protectionism , xenophobic or nostalgic nationalisms or , where a country feels strong and confident enough , a new kind of extraterritoriality , reminiscent of the nineteenth century .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
We can not deny that uncontrolled market forces and unfettered short-term capital flows , to take but a few examples of globalization , have had devastating consequences on our economies , social cohesion , political stability and cultural identity in many cases for the worse rather than for the better . 
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
They will continue as usual to follow their economic , educational , political and social development plans and programmes , knowing that the end of the twentieth century will not automatically mean an end to current regional conflicts .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
To this end , we envisage measures to benefit all sectors of the older population , taking care to ensure that needs are met for those living in the countryside and in outlying urban areas , older women , disabled older persons and all groups of older persons who because of their race , culture , religion , economic situation or political ideas might have limited access to all kinds of services and comprehensive care .  
In conclusion , may I express my delegation ' s sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit will help generate the renewed political will at the national and international levels that is so needed to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
We must give special attention to following up the results achieved at Geneva next June , with a particular eye to translating the agreements from the global perspective of the General Assembly to their regional and national dimensions , with a view to consolidating a political culture in favour of social progress , to use the phrase employed at the Copenhagen meeting that marked the beginning of the social Summit .  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
He did not give us a descriptive report , but one based on his prerogatives , responsibilities and discretionary powers , putting forward a vision and initiatives to confront what he views as threats to international peace and security and ideas on how the United Nations could respond to political , humanitarian and human rights crises .  
In the context of legislative and legal guarantees and taking into account the balance between the needs of the individual and those of society , my country has adopted several political , social and economic measures aimed at the maximum utilization of human resources and the improvement of living standards .  
In Tanzania , the Government undertook a comprehensive reform programme covering all the social , political and economic sectors with the objective of making them more responsive , efficient and accountable to the people .  
Armenia believes that efficient and effective cooperation among the Black Sea countries will help consolidate the strategic economic potential inherent in this area , promote free trade , open roads and other means of communication and foster the welfare of peoples , thus stimulating the peaceful settlement of existing political disputes and reinforcing the independence , sovereignty and democratic development of the BSECO member States . 
Conflicts will continue as long as the North continues to impose an imperfect and environmentally and economically unsustainable political model that may , perhaps , work in the North a model reached after centuries of absolute monarchies , without free or just elections , without universal suffrage , without women having the vote , without eight-hour work days , without what today is called good governance , though this concept has yet to be defined or agreed on by anybody .  
If the political manipulation of human rights continues the selectivity , partiality and double standards ; if economic and social rights are ignored ; if the right to development is disregarded ; if a sectarian and abstract international human rights law is imposed ; and if all human rights are not guaranteed for all human beings conflicts will continue .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
While emphasizing the imperative need for the political will on the part of States to facilitate the access of needy populations to assistance and cooperation , it seems to us equally valuable that the Secretary-General has included , as the first point in his annual report , a reference to the importance of developing a culture of prevention to deal with natural disasters . 
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
In affirmation of the growing needs and common requirements of the member States of the OIC , General Assembly resolution 53-16 of 29 October 1998 called for the strengthening of cooperation between our two organizations in the political , social , economic and humanitarian fields , a detailed review of which is contained in the Secretary-General ' s report .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
On the occasion of the signing we were able to show him some of the progress we have made and reiterate our political will to work for a strengthened , effective and efficient safeguards system , based on an equitable regime that will lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Our strong moral , political and financial support for the Tribunal will ensure not only that future dictatorial regimes will be effectively prosecuted for their actions , but that there will never be a repeat of genocide in our continent or , indeed , worldwide .  
Since the ultimate objective of these measures is to undermine international peace and security and create political and economic instability in other countries , the Islamic Republic of Iran , like other members of the international community , advocates the removal and elimination of all economic and trade embargoes imposed upon Cuba , and believes that differences between States should be settled in a peaceful manner .  
Recognizing the importance of a sound economy to social and political stability , the European Union will continue its considerable economic and technical assistance to the Palestinians with a view to contributing to a more secure and prosperous future for them in the next millennium .  
Continued financial assistance from the international community for the Bethlehem 2000 project is needed for the creation of a strong , self-sufficient and sustainable economic infrastructure for Bethlehem that would provide a sound underpinning for social and political stability , which is a prerequisite for peace in the region .  
We also believe that the Bethlehem 2000 project has a distinct spiritual value , over and above other important economic concerns , and that this event , which commemorates the birth of Christ , must be shielded from harmful and unnecessary political hindrances that could frustrate its legitimate goal .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
In implementing that resolution the two institutions set up cooperative machinery , thanks to a cooperative agreement designed to strengthen their ties on issues of common interest , notably in the political , economic , scientific and cultural areas .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
It is significant that throughout the political campaign leading to the first round of general elections , held just 12 days ago , and whose final outcome will be decided in the run-off scheduled for 26 December , each and every one of the political parties , without exception , expressed full support for the implementation of the peace agreements , as well as for the continued presence in Guatemala of the Verification Mission . Indeed , MINUGUA forms an integral part of those Agreements . 
For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
Although humanitarian action takes place in contexts in which political , economic , social and military factors are inextricably connected , it is absolutely vital for humanitarian institutions to preserve the strictly non-political and impartial character of their mission .  
At the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies on Democracy and Development , held at Bucharest , Romania , two years ago , the representatives of new or restored democracies noted that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to the political , economic and social problems that our societies face .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
The Government and the civil society of Yemen are working closely and strenuously to make democracy an irreversibly solid trend of national policy and an evolutionary process , so that democracy will ultimately become the focal point of political , social and economic life in Yemen .  
At our second Conference , held in Managua in 1994 , we took another important step when we adopted the Managua Declaration and Plan of Action , which addressed issues relating to the political and reconciliation processes within national societies , human rights and the right of all nations to development , economic reforms , structural adjustment programmes and other problems facing democratic States .  
Here we saw the iron curtain descend on Europe , that line of separation which subsequently hung for several decades and embodied multi-faceted confrontation ideological , political , military and economic confrontation between totalitarian and democratic systems .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
But we must remember that it is a process : a series of steps which build upon each other so that the final result , which we firmly believe to be achievable , will have come about through gradual , careful and deliberate negotiation and not through imperfect solutions imposed from outside or as a consequence of inherent power imbalances or short-term political expediency .  
We are convinced that expanding our interaction with the OSCE will help reinforce security and stability in our region on the basis of the fundamental , universal and democratic values , principles and obligations of the OSCE , taking into account the specific national features and traditions of our country and its political and social experience .  
Mr . Gatilov ( Russian Federation ) ( spoke in Russian ) : Today ' s discussion is taking place against the backdrop of the major political outcomes of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) Istanbul summit , which laid down the basic guidelines for the formation of a stable architecture for security and cooperation on the European continent in the twenty-first century on the basis of the United Nations Charter and generally recognized principles of international law . 
In this connection , CARICOM reiterates its long-standing view that these studies and analyses called for in the plan of action are vital to a systematic and complete assessment on the part of the international community of the prevailing economic , political and social conditions in all of the Non-Self-Governing Territories as they progress towards a full measure of self-government .  
A cursory review of the political and constitutional development of the remaining mostly small island Non-Self-Governing Territories , makes it evident that none of them have met the essential criteria of full and absolute political equality , as defined by the General Assembly in its landmark resolutions .  
We are committed to working in partnership with Africa to secure peace and democracy , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , political stability and economic and social development .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
Two months later , at Sirte in Libya , the fourth extraordinary session of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU considered the ways and means of strengthening the organization with a view to rendering it more effective and adaptable to social , political and economic changes and to making it the preferred instrument for collective action for Africa and for cooperation with the rest of the world .  
There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
The armed conflicts that have for years been tearing apart the Horn of Africa and Central Africa have resulted in thousands of deaths , orphans , refugees and displaced persons in brief , an unprecedented humanitarian disaster compounded by the collapse of economic and social and , sometimes , political infrastructures .  
The third specific characteristic of the current efforts for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the creation and functioning of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe , which has , in the five months of its existence , completed the important evolution from political declaration to operational international mechanism .  
It has weighty legal , political and strategic implications , since it affects one of the vital organs of the United Nations , entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security and thereby vulnerable to the subtle interplay of the interests of the Powers , sometimes to the detriment of the very cause of maintaining international peace and security that it is supposed to promote .  
Indeed , all agree to recognize that , in the wake of substantial upheavals on the international scene , the membership and present structure that were dictated by the world situation of 1945 have become obsolete and anachronistic and do not reflect the political and economic realities of our era nor , a fortiori , those of the coming millennium .  
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
The economic and political developments in international relations ; the far-reaching changes that have taken place , particularly in the wake of the end of the cold war ; and the accession of many new States to the membership of the United Nations all have made it imperative that the Security Council be reformed , its membership increased and its methods of work and activities made more effective in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
We are aware , however , that the full potential of confidence-building can be developed only in conjunction with further political steps that require the steady , persistent and sometimes painstaking effort of the international community .  
The five principles of peaceful coexistence make up the political foundation underpinning world peace ; mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity constitute the economic guarantee for world peace ; dialogue , consultations and negotiations between the parties concerned on an equal footing represent the correct approach to resolving disputes and safeguarding peace.In this context , we call on the international community to take this new security concept as a guideline .  
Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Over the last quarter-century , through an exhaustive and inclusive process of dialogue and discussion and through programmes of action and international cooperation , population has become part of the global dialogue on economic and social development.It has become part of every countrys political thinking and planning .  
Not only have we had to battle against established customs and the preachings of a number of conservative sectors , we also although this may be difficult to believe have had to deal with a number of non-governmental organizations which , when they did not get the budgetary support they expected , joined the campaign being waged by some parts of the media and certain political sectors and , betraying their principles , acted in opposition to the reproductive health programmes .  
Women are occupying more important positions in everyday life , and the numbers of women participating in all economic , cultural , political , social and intellectual activities has increased significantly .  
In this connection , we appeal also for resolute action by Governments to strengthen their political will in respect of establishing effective and transparent partnerships , both at the national level with civil society and at the bilateral level .  
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
The League of Arab States was a participant in regional and international preparatory meetings relating to population issues , which demonstrates our deep interest in this subject and our conviction that it is the role of mankind to work towards social development and to participate in political and national security affairs whether in our region or in the world at large .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
The Working Group expressed its deep concern in relation to the continuing grave violations of womens human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the persistent and pervasive discrimination against women .  
The Working Group was concerned at the allegations of the violations of the human rights of women , including widespread arbitrary arrest , use of excessive force during arrests , incommunicado detention , prolonged administrative detention , detention of minors , torture and ill-treatment , unfair trial and forcible exile of political opponents and prisoners .  
Representatives agreed that the creation of an enabling environment that includes a legislative framework and political commitment at the highest level is a prerequisite for effective social change and improvement in womens health .  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
The Committee recommends that the State party accord equal treatment to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in terms of their domestic legal status and that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations consideration be given to similar measures in relation to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
Indeed , at its forty-ninth session in August 1997 , the Sub-Commission adopted resolution 1997-7 in which it requested one of its experts , Mr . Mustapha Mehedi , to prepare a working paper on the right to education with the purpose of explaining the content of the right to education , taking account , in particular , of its social dimension and the freedoms it includes and of its dual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural character .  
The World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993 underscored the interdependence of all human rights , and emphasized that all societies should work to ensure the enjoyment by all their members of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including their right to development .  
The Convention codifies women ' s right to non _ discrimination and equality with men and also establishes that women and men are equally entitled to the full enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
To that end , they pledge to increase their efforts to assess factors and obstacles that impinge on women ' s enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social , cultural and other rights and to suggest specific actions on how such obstacles might be overcome so that full enjoyment of human rights by all , without discrimination , may be realized .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
The Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom knows better than anyone else that the methods he has been employing in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are prompted by narrow political considerations inimical to Iraq and have played a large part in impeding implementation of the oil-for-food programme and in delaying the arrival of foodstuffs and basic necessities covered by the provisions of this programme .  
Yet it further stated that , apart from the statistical definition of the term youth mentioned above , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and sociocultural circumstances .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
Recent international meetings on population issues , including the high-level regional meeting concerning Asia and the Pacific that had been held recently in Bangkok , had contributed to the establishment of the political commitment needed to integrate developmental , population and environmental strategies at global , regional , national and local levels .  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the activities carried out by the United Nations system , as well as the observations and recommendations contained in the report , with respect to building a political culture through human rights observance , mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , free and independent media , enhancing the rule of law and improving accountability , transparency and quality of public sector management and democratic structures of government ;  
In the current international context , characterized by growing interdependence and globalization , it is essential for Member States to show greater political will by intensifying dialogue and joint undertakings and strengthening international cooperation through confidence-building measures , which can reduce tension and the risk of armed confrontation between States .  
While supporting the principle that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lay with States , his delegation wished to underline in that regard that initiatives aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political unity of independent and sovereign States must not be encouraged .  
It had consistently maintained that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be carried out in strict compliance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , as stated in the Charter of the United Nations , and on the basis of the traditional fundamental principles of peacekeeping such as the consent of the parties , impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
What the Convention will do is create a system that makes that extremely difficult as a practical matter , because of its system of monitoring sensitive chemicals , its challenge inspection provisions , its economic and political sanctions , and by creating a forum for determining collective action to combat the threat of chemical weapons .  
The Court ' s credibility in the eyes of the public and particularly in the eyes of the legal community has been weakened by the dismissal of three of its judges , who considered an interpretative provision of the Constitution with obvious political content to be unconstitutional . 
The General Assembly has established the following six main committees : First Committee , disarmament and international security issues ; Second Committee , economic and financial issues ; Third Committee , social , humanitarian and cultural issues ; Fourth Committee , special political and decolonization issues ; Fifth Committee , administrative and budgetary issues ; and Sixth Committee , legal issues .  
With all key positions in the Missions political and administrative staffing structure filled at the early stages of the Missions deployment , the potential adverse impact of the reported initial vacancy rates on the delivery of the Missions mandated activities was minimized .  
Non-discrimination is the overriding principle of international human rights law and thus applies to civil and political , as well as to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to the rights of the child which cut across these two categories .  
The Special Rapporteur attended the seventh session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 22 and 23 April 1998 and made a statement on 22 April 1998 , in which he said that crime prevention and bribery in international commercial transactions required the cooperation not only of the international community but the political will of Governments to organize their domestic systems of justice to meet the challenges . 
We are of the opinion that the workshops and conferences held on the subject of the permanent forum reveal a consensus in favour of endowing the permanent forum with competence in respect not only of the cultural , economic , social and political rights of the indigenous peoples but also educational and health matters affecting the indigenous peoples , with a view to promoting better services corresponding to their way of life .  
All the Koreans at home and abroad should be united firmly under the uplifted banner of national reunification irrespective of differences in ideology , ideals , religious belief and political views and class and social stratum .  
Since independence , the Croatian education system has undergone a major transformation ; national curricula and syllabuses now reflect new principles of economic , social and political development , thereby enabling pupils to gain access to the skills and responsibilities required in a democratic society .  
The political and electoral platform has emphasized the migrants cost to society , yet has omitted their very important contributions in the cultural , scientific , technical , social and economic fields . 
Protection , however , extends beyond safeguarding physical security to encompass the broad range of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
This task is fulfilled through in-depth analyses , pioneering research and debates , conducted with a multidisciplinary methodology , on the process of social and economic change in contemporary societies and of the demands addressed to political , legal , judicial and social professions .  
The observer for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference reiterated support for the draft declaration in its current form which , if adopted , would guarantee the political , social , economic and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and lead to a path of peace based on mutual respect .  
The observer for the Saami Council stated that the draft declaration guaranteed the basic rights and fundamental political and legal rights of indigenous peoples and that it constituted a major breakthrough principally because it underlined the principle of equality for indigenous peoples ; this had usually been denied on the grounds of discrimination . 
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
From a legislative perspective , it is important to devise institutional arrangements for the regulatory functions which ensure to the regulatory body an adequate level of efficiency , taking into account the political , legal and administrative tradition of the country .  
Since the situation of human rights in Myanmar is worsening and the repression of civil and political rights continues unabated , the Special Rapporteur feels bound to renew the detailed recommendations he made in paragraphs 7 to 97 of his last report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E CN . 4-1998-70 ) and in paragraphs 61 to 63 of his interim report to the General Assembly ( A 53-364 ) .  
An independent , effective and fair court must be perceived to be a judicial body guided by legal rather than political considerations .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
The problem of impunity was addresses in the agreements reached between the Government and the political parties and there is a formal commitment - set forth in presidential decrees - to impose administrative and judicial penalties on those found guilty of human rights violations .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
Efforts directed at the elimination of all inferior treatment and discrimination of which women are victims should be continued until they achieve equal opportunities with men and are fully integrated into the process of socio _ economic , cultural and political development of the country ;  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
Nevertheless , the situation in Azerbaijan underscores that protection for the internally displaced must extend beyond safeguarding their physical security to also encompass the broad range of economic , social , civil and political rights provided for under international human rights law .  
In light of this , what is most appropriate now , as Ethiopia has made known repeatedly , and what is called for , to reverse what Eritrea is determined to make imminent , is the application of effective and meaningful pressure on Eritrea in all areas - political , diplomatic and economic - to force it to see reason and to give peace a chance .  
Your tireless efforts to restore my country to peace and plenty , as well as the personal contributions of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to the same objective , and the unabated commitment to reaching a comprehensive political settlement in Abkhazia on the part of Friends of the Secretary-General and of the brave men and women of international personnel are truly invaluable .  
The reorganized Civil Affairs Branch will be headed by a civilian chief , at the P-4 level , with political legal background , assisted by a civil affairs officer at the P-3 level .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences 102 ] or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
While respecting Algerias stages of political , economic , sociological and cultural development and acknowledging that popular support is necessary for any reform relating to womens rights , the Committee encourages the Government , non-governmental organizations , intellectuals and the mass media to do everything possible by means of publicity and public awareness campaigns to encourage more enlightened attitudes and accelerate womens emancipation .  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term discrimination against women shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
In order to foster coordination between the State and civil society , numerous mass events focusing on the issue of womens political and social participation and involving over 22 , 000 women ( parliaments , town meetings and social dialogues ) were held between 1995 and 1998 . These gave rise to permanent forums such as the womens regional round tables .  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .  
Such a conference would provide a forum for Ugandan religious leaders , parliamentarians , notables , local political and administrative leaders , non _ governmental organizations and associations to discuss the situation in northern Uganda , with a view to formulating a political platform conducive to the pacification of northern Uganda through participatory political processes and socio-economic rehabilitation .  
When , at its fifty-second session , the Committee had been required to take a decision on paragraph 21 of the text that was to become resolution 52-118 , his delegation had drawn attention to the tendency to adopt resolutions that were political in nature on the methods of work of bodies which had been established pursuant to international instruments.If that trend continued , it might have an adverse impact on the effective implementation of the instruments .  
The Vienna Conference emphasized the need for Governments and the United Nations to make the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex a priority goal of their policies .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Further to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognized that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his her civil and political rights .  
In adopting the Declaration on the Right to Development , the General Assembly , in resolution 41-128 , recognized that development is a comprehensive , cultural , political , economic , and social process which aims at constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ) .  
The poverty trap in which the poorest of the poor find themselves shows how human rights are indivisible and interdependent : the right to an adequate standard of living , to housing , to education , to work , to good health , to employment , to the protection of the family , to respect for privacy , to legal status and registration as a citizen , to life and physical integrity , to justice and participation in political , social and cultural life .  
On appeal , the European Court held , inter alia , that : the law was unreasonable ; it was impossible to prove the truth of opinions ; the characterization of the politician had been reasonable ; and the journalist ' s article had been part of a larger political debate and not merely a gratuitous attack on the individual concerned .  
In the statement it issued on the occasion of General Ivachov ' s visit , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic indicated that the frank and unambiguous statements by the above-mentioned military official of the Russian Federation strengthened Azerbaijan ' s apprehension regarding the purpose of this new phase of political and military cooperation between Russia and Armenia , which had thus been lifted to a qualitatively different strategic level .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
This will require that the Programme of Action be firmly placed on the political agenda at the national , regional and international levels and be fully recognized by Governments and civil society in all small island developing States and the international community as the framework for sustainable development activities in small island developing States .  
The Government of Iraq , condemning in the strongest terms these official actions by the United States , the United Kingdom and Turkey as irresponsible and illegal , requests you to intervene directly with the Governments of these States and to urge them to desist from their persistent interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and to honour the Charter of the United Nations , which affirms respect for the sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity of Member States .  
Welcomes the convening , in 1999 , of an intergovernmental meeting of experts on the El Nio phenomenon , to be held at Lima , which will have a comprehensive approach , encompassing scientific , technical , social and political issues , and a broad participation of intergovernmental experts and policy decision makers ;  
The people of Burundi must know this ; they must know that no more time must be lost in so senseless and futile a conflict and that the time has come for political realism and collective responsibility so that Burundi may become a land of milk and honey , where each citizen has the capacity to realize his or her potential in complete freedom and justice .  
Article 1 of the Declaration states that the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
To ask the leading human rights non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council to submit information and insights relevant to the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be broad enough to cover the concerns of indigenous peoples , including cultural , civil , political and economic rights , health issues , the rights of women and children , education , development , the environment , human rights and conflict prevention and resolution ;  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation the affirmative action that might have been adopted to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and it is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect .  
The international community can and must play a major and continuing role in supporting these efforts by working with the countries involved to promote reconciliation , broaden political participation , lay the groundwork for economic recovery and help build systems of justice that are fair , credible and effective . 
Too often , nationalism has been used to advance a racist , discriminatory , and persecutory policy that scapegoats ethnic , religious , and political groups as a false pretext for the existence of national problems .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
That , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
The Cologne initiative should be flexibly interpreted by the international financial institutions to the full benefit of all debtors without discrimination , and appropriate resources should be devoted to reduce considerably the stock of debt and its servicing , while bearing in mind that debt relief measures should safeguard social , economic and political stability in developing countries .  
In addition , UNDP has fielded a mission to assess the feasibility of , and host government interest in , the creation of an early warning mechanism that would monitor , at the subregional level , key economic , social , political , ethnic and religious variables , carry out systematic trend analysis to track changes and potential tensions and provide , in a timely fashion , much-needed signals of forthcoming crises or emergencies .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
While SADC welcomed debt-relief initiatives , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt initiative , it believed that the international community should start writing off the external debt of those countries that had made visible and sustainable progress in the implementation of tough structural adjustment measures and political reforms , so that they could invest the resources thus freed up in social sectors .  
In that connection , the preparatory committee for the special session would need to address a number of issues , including foreign debt , the decline in official development assistance , factors impeding access to foreign markets and weak financial flows to countries in economic and political transition .  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Strongly supports the efforts made to enable the people of Haiti to express their political will in the forthcoming legislative and local elections , invites all the political leaders of the country to involve themselves in a constructive dialogue and , in this connection , invites the Government of Haiti to ensure the necessary political and security environment for the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the schedule recently announced by the Provisional Electoral Council ;  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;

Such solidarity , based on the interdependence of economic , political , cultural and spiritual elements , should inspire the wealthy to feel responsible for the poor and the marginalized and help the weak and the poor to overcome passivity and hopelessness .  
It is imperative that even as we work towards developing the requisite political will , in the interim the international community accepts the need for urgent practical steps that will diminish nuclear dangers .

But it was not just a question of free trade ; many developing countries were desperately in need of basic physical , educational , legal and even political infrastructure in order to participate in the global economy .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
We have observed that the continent inherited a myriad of ills from the colonial past , which fundamentally affected the social , political and economic foundations of its society , thus constraining its present capacity for stability and development .  
Rather , it is an ongoing , agreed , systematic and comprehensive participatory process that must become part of the dynamic of national construction in various areas political , economic , social and cultural .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .

The advantages and disadvantages of both courses of action and their widely differing legal , political and moral basis should be recognized , without overlooking the major differences between their application at regional level .  
Given the vast numbers of refugees existing in the world , it was obvious that legal arrangements were needed for their protection , but because the political circumstances varied , special arrangements were required in each case .  
Expansion of the membership must be responsive to the changed global political and economic climate , reflecting the new realities in the global arena and respecting the principles of sovereign equality among all States and equitable geographical distribution .

The true impact of the meeting would become apparent in the months ahead , but UNDP was confident that the meeting represented a major step towards regaining for its work the political support and attention that it deserved .  
The constructive role played by civil society organizations in raising public awareness on the issue of conflict diamonds , proposing practical solutions and helping generate the necessary political will required for concrete action .  
Mr . Jayanama ( Thailand ) , speaking under subitems 114 ( b ) and ( e ) , stressed the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights and the importance of giving equal attention to civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights . 
Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development ;  
In that context , international cooperation should be based on dialogue guided by objectivity , impartiality and nonselectivity , so as to achieve the universality of human rights in harmony with the diverse cultures and political , economic and social systems .  
Within a short space of time , what had hitherto been internal , national provincial border has become international in nature , with all the political , legal , and not least social and humanitarian ramifications .  
The global debate on democratization and human rights can be sharpened by paying greater attention to specific problems of political and institutional reform at the local , national and international levels .  
It requires comprehensive strategies involving all relevant actors and embracing multiple sectors of activity , including political , military , diplomatic , development , human rights , humanitarian and many others .  
It can not be separated from the political , military , economic and social situations prevailing in other West African countries , and particularly from the growing instability on the common border between Sierra Leone , Guinea and Liberia .  
Contrary to many assumptions , GuineaBissau was able to institute a democratic regime in which the main political bodies are headed by officials elected by direct and universal suffrage , in elections supervised by the United Nations .  
The history of our countries in the decade just past has been marked by a plethora of bloody national and civil conflicts and an unprecedented intensification of ethnic , political and social enmity , xenophobia and alienation .  
In a sphere which was so complex at the technical level and so delicate at the political level , it was not advisable to adopt an innovative and revolutionary approach .  
The Cuban Governments unshakeable political will was reflected in the position achieved by women in Cuban society , their cultural , technical and professional level and their high rates of economic , political and social participation .  
Since the Summit , policies and programmes to achieve social development have been implemented within the context of national economic , political , social , legal , cultural and historical environments .  
To eradicate poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind :  
In short , increased responsibility in the arena of selfgovernance is linked to mature political and civic behaviour , which is not demonstrated by these violent acts .  
Extreme poverty and thus the lack of basic social services is a violation of human rights because extreme poverty is the main obstacle to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
In light of the work of the Committee and of the latest scientific research , it is obvious that economic , social and cultural rights are as justiciable as civil and political rights .  
National Governments and local authorities are called upon to respond properly and in a timely fashion to the political , economic , social and humanitarian circumstances that have the potential to lead to armed conflict or to the intensification of an ongoing conflict .  
Despite the efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to facilitate recovery , the people there continue to suffer , with admirable courage , the vicissitudes of a long political transition process that is having a devastating effect on economic structures , as well as the ravages of two successive armed conflicts that have hampered the speedy reconstruction of the country and of the social infrastructure , which has been hard hit by the years of crises . 
This has provided us with the opportunity , in the face of adversity , to redouble efforts to foster national unity and strengthen democratic institutions , and to promote activities aimed at the economic growth and social development of the country , which we had begun before this natural disaster struck , in order to preserve the political , economic and social stability that had been achieved .  
Invites the Bureau of the preparatory committee to play an active and important role in the intergovernmental preparations for the World Summit and to mobilize political support at the highest possible level in both developed and developing countries while pursuing the support of all heads of international organizations within the United Nations system and of international financial institutions and the Global Environment Facility and to actively support the role of the Committee in monitoring with a view to considering the reports of all relevant intergovernmental processes .  
On the contrary , the scientific and technical aspects of space debris were closely interrelated with political and legal aspects and it would not be feasible to attempt to resolve all scientific and technical issues without simultaneous consideration of those of a political and legal nature .  
As provided for by the Offices terms of reference , UNTOPs activities during the past year have focused on the consolidation of peace ; political support for efforts to mobilize international resources and assistance for national recovery and reconstruction ; promotion of the rule of law and the strengthening of democratic institutions ; support for local human rights initiatives ; and promotion of coordinated and focused effort by the United Nations system in the country in matters related to peace-building .  
The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
Secondly , clear definitions of terms loosely used in the previous report , such as illegal , legitimate , power and control , should be established in relation to the specific and unique political situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region .  
Likewise , the political support of the United Nations in this case , the Security Council and the provision of material and technical assistance by the international community are essential for the successful implementation of the ECOWAS initiative to deploy a multinational ECOWAS Monitoring Group force along the borders of Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone .  
Worthy of particular note in his report was the message conveyed to the Mission by the heads of State of the region , who thought that greater subregional integration in the political , security , economic and social spheres should remain a key objective for the United Nations family if durable solutions to conflict and to the tragic humanitarian suffering that accompanies conflict are to be secured .  
The exceptional complexity of this precarious situation in terms of security , humanitarian , economic , social and political matters can no longer be addressed through piecemeal , sectoral or ad hoc responses .  
Thus , the sanctions , the search for a political solution , and the humanitarian and economic efforts all need to be taken as a whole and pursued as parts of an integrated strategy leading to a broad based and responsible government in Afghanistan .  
As my Government remains unwaveringly committed to defending the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of the country , I would like to reaffirm our strong belief in a peaceful political settlement of the conflict and to reiterate our wholehearted support for the pivotal mediating role of the United Nations , aimed at the establishment of a broad-based , multi-ethnic and fully representative Government in Afghanistan . In this context , the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan already last Friday sent identical letters to the Secretary-General and to yourself , Sir .  
First , the peace process in the Congo has lately witnessed a number of consecutive steps that have served to maintain the current momentum aimed at implementing the Lusaka Agreement in both its military and political components and at reaching a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict , which has been tearing the Congo apart and draining the energies of its neighbours for almost three years . 
It is recognized , however , that to achieve substantive progress the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina has to be fully committed to the speedy achievement of a durable peace , mutual accommodation and the establishment of political , human and legal rights .  
The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
In the countries middle of an acute crisis and we have several examples of such crises in Africa the United Nations and the donors face the worst possible conditions in war-torn and occupied countries , with their resources sometimes plundered , and with a lack of clear political prospects for restoring trust among the people .  In these conditions , to start implementing the economic and social development programmes that are necessary for bringing about a lasting resolution to the crisis is a considerable challenge .  
They concluded that the most promising form of prevention was to elaborate integrated , long-term strategies combining a broad range of political , economic , social and other measures to reduce or suppress the causes of conflict .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
In this respect , the presence of political leaders who are prepared to handle social complaints and demands by violent means with a view to satisfying selfish political and economic ambitions is the real cause of , and an inevitable catalyst of , social violence and armed conflicts .  
In Zaire and in Haiti , the armed conflicts resulted from the actions of hardened , corrupt , dictatorial governments that turned their backs on the civilian population and established violence as the norm of political discourse and squandered national resources .  
The political , economic , environmental , social , humanitarian , information and many other components of preventive activities are coming to the fore .  
I would note , however , that although there is clearly an urgent need for demonstrable progress in this area and we know that this issue of return is of key symbolic and political importance it remains UNMIKs and our firm policy that return should take place in secure and sustainable conditions .  
It is clear that the Government of Iraq is indifferent to the humanitarian dimension of this issue , because it refuses to resume its participation in the meetings of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , whose meetings it boycotted in January 1998 on the basis of unjustifiable political pretexts despite the humanitarian suffering of those innocent prisoners , their families and loved ones .  
Instead of responding to the repeated calls of regional and international organizations that it take the necessary steps to demonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State of Kuwait and other neighbouring countries and that it change its political and informational language with a view to establishing an atmosphere of confidence , Iraq at the Arab summit held in Jordan last March rejected the inclusion of a paragraph in the final declaration renewing its commitment to guaranteeing the security and sovereignty of the State of Kuwait . 
This public meeting is an ideal opportunity for my delegation to pay a warm tribute to the Special Representative , all the staff of UNTAET and all the Members of the East Timor Transitional Administration for the steps they have taken in the political process leading to the national and international sovereignty of East Timor and the emergence of an independent East Timorese Government .  
The fact that these parties have committed themselves to respecting the ballot results , to conducting themselves peacefully with mutual respect and to defending pluralistic democracy clearly attests to the maturity of the East Timorese political leaders and their determination to establish the bases of a solid democratic and an economically viable State .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
In its presidential statement on peace-building , adopted last February , the Council also reiterated that efforts to ensure lasting solutions to conflicts and to maintain the momentum for peace in any given country or region require increased solidarity , sustained political will and timely and adequate resources on the part of the international community .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
However , we strongly believe that the dynamic of the entire peace process can be maintained and moved forward only if the responsibilities and the political will of the parties is fulfilled and translated into real action .  
The Security Council , having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 11 October 2001 ( S / 2001 / 963 ) and having held a public meeting on 19 October 2001 ( S / PV . 4392 and S / PV . 4392 resumption 1 ) , reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia , consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and bearing in mind its respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity , political independence and unity of Somalia .  
We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia , for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made .  
On the national level , Tunisia has found efficient solutions through the implementation of a comprehensive strategy political , economic , social , cultural and educational as well as strengthening the rule of law and government institutions , thereby distancing ourselves from threats of terrorism and violence .  
My Government , the British Government , has a simple message for terrorists and those who support terrorism : terrorism , the deliberate targeting of innocent people for political ends , is criminal , and there is no political , religious or ideological cause which can possibly justify the use of such indiscriminate violence .  
The Presidents of the two countries , General Pervez Musharraf and Mr . Mohammad Khatami , assured me in no uncertain terms that , because the see the establishment of a stable and representative Government accountable to all Afghans to be in their own national interests , they would like the United Nations to play a pivotal role in the process of finding a political solution .  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
We should like to stress once again that responsible political management , combined with an absolute and immediate determination to implement institutional , legal and economic reforms in full , are essential prerequisites for speedy integration into European Union structures .  
That can become a reality only if coercive and firm measures are taken against the FDD and FNL armed groups , which have stepped up their violent actions against the innocent population since the establishment of the transitional Government , and which no longer have any political justification for turning a deaf ear to appeals for negotiation and ceasefire . 
We note with interest the remark contained in paragraph 10 of the report that the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , regardless of the political system or governing authority in place , has been one of systematic abuse of its natural and human resources , such that a country noted for its vast natural resources was reduced to being one of the poorest and debt-ridden by the early 1990s . 
Were the Council to fail to effectively assume its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security or to contain the volatile situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , we fear that , given the inability of the other parties to achieve concrete progress in prevailing upon the Israeli Government to accept steps that would lead to a political solution , the situation would become yet more tense and would get completely out of control , having a very negative impact on the stability of this vital part of our world .  
Article 1 , paragraph 1 , of the Declaration of 1986 states : The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The article spells out three principles : first , there is a human right called the right to development which is inalienable ; second , there is a particular process of economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ; and third , the right to development is a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy that particular process of development .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
It refers to the realization of all the rights and freedoms recognized as human rights - civil and political rights and economic and social and cultural rights - in their totality as an integrated whole , as all these rights are interrelated and interdependent .  
He described the right to development as a vector composed of various elements including the right to food , the right to health , the right to education , the right to housing and other economic , social and cultural rights , as well as all the civil and political rights together with the rates of growth of GDP and other financial , technical and institutional resources that enable any improvement in the well-being of the entire population and the realization of the rights to be sustained .  
Since the right to development has been recognized as a human right distinct from the individual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , it is indeed necessary to consider a monitoring mechanism that is separate from the treaty bodies .  
All forms of human rights civil , cultural , economic , social and political are integral and indivisible rights of our peoples .  
Confident of the contributions that Bahrain , under the leadership of its Amir , His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa , can make to consolidating and strengthening the GCC process during its presidency of the Councils forthcoming session in order to guide it towards new horizons that will enable it to cope in a positive manner with the rapid and continuous changes required by the process of globalization at the political , economic , social and cultural levels ,  
Reinforcement and strengthening of the GCC process in terms of enhanced coordination , cooperation , interlinkage and integration , by adopting a unified strategy in the political , economic , security , military , social , information , cultural and scientific fields based on unity of purpose and a common destiny .  
At the special session of the General Assembly , Governments included corporate social responsibility towards development as one of the elements under commitment 1 to creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
It had expressed regret , however , that full information on the preliminary estimate of resources was not available in the proposed budget outline , despite the fact that in its resolution 53 / 206 , the General Assembly had requested that provisions should be made in the budget outline for expenditures for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved in the course of the biennium .  
COHCHR has also received allegations of police violence and excessive use of force , summary and extrajudicial execution , disappearance , mob killings , torture , political intimidation and violence against members of political parties , in particular the opposition party , including instances of extrajudicial execution , interference of the executive in judicial matters , curtailment of the freedom of association and expression and intimidation of human rights defenders .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments assert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The Declaration provides guidance for realizing development and human rights in a complementary and comprehensive manner , and identifies international cooperation as a duty of the international community ; in this framework , international cooperation should focus on the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the formulation of international development policies for ensuring development and eliminating obstacles thereto .  
UNOMIG reported that in several regions of Georgia , including Abkhazia , one of the greatest threats to the local population , representatives of the international humanitarian organizations and United Nations personnel , seemed to come from loosely organized and poorly commanded paramilitary organizations , some of which may be supported by political circles while others were exclusively criminally motivated .  
Democracy is a system of universal values and is based on recognition of the inalienable nature of the dignity and equal value of all human beings ; everyone has the right to play an active role in social , professional and political life and to enjoy the right to development ;  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
To ensure true respect for freedom of the press and equal access of the various political forces to the public and private media , whether written or audio-visual , under a regulatory system that is in line with democratic principles ;  
Turkmenistan has consistently and insistently supported the establishment in international relations of a more humane , equitable and constructive order , opposed all forms of discrimination , the isolation of States on political or ideological grounds and the imposition of various types of economic sanctions , embargoes and the like , and urged respect for the distinctive characteristics of each country and its chosen model of social and political development .  
Despite the economic war waged against Cuba for nearly four decades , the position achieved by women in society , their cultural , technical and professional level , their high rates of economic , political and social participation , and the radical changes in their attitudes and lives were significant indicators of social progress .  
The Court should not be subject to political pressure ; rather , it must be a respectable , credible institution that would prevent certain States from committing regrettable acts such as allowing their judicial officers to recklessly prosecute the political leaders of other sovereign , independent States with whose policies they disagreed ; it should also put a final end to State terrorism of the type currently engaged in by Rwandans , Ugandans and Burundians against his country . 
However , a glance at the present pattern of armed conflicts , whether internal or international , and the fact that mercenaries are involved in most of them would seem to confirm the opinion held by the Office of the Special Rapporteur , namely , that mercenary activities are continuing in many parts of the world and that the presence of mercenaries is still connected with situations that affect the self-determination of peoples as well as peace , political stability , life , physical integrity , freedom and security .  
These killings are symptoms of deeply rooted and complex social , economic and political problems coupled with surging crime rates , which continue to plague the human rights situation in these countries .  
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
The definition and methodology lacked clarity , and the concept seemed more appropriate for a multinational corporation for which profit was paramount than for a multilateral international organization pursuing sensitive and complex political and socio-economic objectives agreed upon by consensus .  
The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna had reached consensus on areas for action and objectives for the promotion of human rights , which no longer covered only civil and political rights but also , on an equal footing , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The policy of civil harmony , introduced by the President of the Republic and clearly ratified by popular referendum , the goodwill and clemency measures , and the unusual openness in the political arena and among the communications media reflected the determination of the Algerian people and of the public authorities to continue to strengthen the democratic process , creating a genuine culture of human rights and a more just society , without fear or arbitrariness .  
The unhealthy tendency to overstate alleged violations of civil and political rights with a view to satisfying special interest groups or domestic constituencies had become a characteristic of the Third Committees country-specific draft resolutions .  
The Administration was determined to pursue its current efforts to consolidate its achievements in social , cultural , economic and political fields , and to intensify its endeavours to ensure the progressive enjoyment of all aspects of human rights by the people of Myanmar .  
A high-level council for human rights had been established , with links to international organizations and local non-governmental organizations , and efforts were being made to involve the people in public life , especially through the establishment of non-governmental organizations in the human rights field dealing with political , social and economic questions .  
The ability of the Office of the High Commissioner to take action must be strengthened in order to further the realization of economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights and to reinforce coordination between the Office and other international and regional organizations with a view to facilitating better analysis of the situation in that area and the adoption of preventive measures .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
As the UNDP Resident Representative in Malabo had informed the Minister in a letter dated 4 February 2000 , technical and financial assistance in connection with the elections was made conditional on a mission to evaluate the conditions in which the electoral process would take place as well as the existence of prior agreement on United Nations involvement throughout the electoral process and the unrestricted participation of candidates of all political parties .  
In brief , those conclusions found that in Equatorial Guinea any person can be deprived of liberty with no effective judicial remedy , and even subjected to torture , as a result of the profound distrust entertained by the Government towards any form of dissidence , which has prevented the political agreements concluded since 1993 between the governing party and opposition parties from ever being given effect .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
His Government had always attached great importance to the protection of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , as reflected in his countrys Constitution , which guaranteed all citizens those rights .  
It complied with international human rights instruments and conventions on the basis of its historical , religious , economic and cultural heritage , always within the framework of political pluralism , freedom of expression and elected representation in peoples assemblies and local bodies and in popular organizations covering all sectors of the population .  
In 1975 , after enduring periods of foreign domination , colonization and neo-colonialism , his countrys multi-ethnic people had chosen a political system suited to their historical , economic , social and cultural particularities .  
For that reason his delegation had sponsored resolutions on the protection and security of small States in 1989 , 1991 and 1994 and remained convinced that a long-term solution to the problem required , among other things , the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to assist small States in protecting their security , sovereignty and territorial integrity in time of need .  Such assistance should be regarded as a political and moral obligation on the part of the international community .  
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
The challenge ahead requires [ adequate ] [ new and additional ] financial resources , technology transfer , and , where appropriate , political will , as well as commitment to innovative ways of applying energy efficient , environmentally sound and cost-effective technologies and systems to all sectors of the economy .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction whatsoever , was also underlined .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
The Court , inter alia , said : The political decision not to end the conflict by violent means but to seek negotiated and concerted solutions is an act of sovereignty on the part of the State , since it adopts exceptional measures to deal with an irregular situation , recover its capacity to suppress and punish crime and bring fresh impetus to a just , social , political and economic order which truly protects and secures human rights .  
The Government also wishes to record its categorical disagreement with and rejection of the double-counting and descriptions in the report of the appalling acts committed by the paramilitary groups , firstly speaking of violations of civil and political rights and secondly referring to violations of the terms of international humanitarian law as expressed in conventions and customary law .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,

The Committee recommends that the general principles of the Convention , in particular the provisions of its articles 2 , 3 and 12 , be appropriately integrated in all relevant legislation concerning children and applied in all political , judicial and administrative decisions and in projects , programmes and services which have an impact on all children , including non-citizen children , and guide the determination of policy-making at every level and actions taken by social and health welfare institutions , courts of law and administrative authorities .  
The Committee is concerned that the principles of non-discrimination ( art . 2 of the Convention ) , best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and respect for the views of the child ( art . 12 ) are not fully reflected in the State partys legislation and political , administrative and judicial decisions , as well as in its policies and programmes relevant to children both at the national and the local level .  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .  
The Ministerial Council then reviewed the outcome of the meetings of a number of ministerial and technical committees held for the purpose of promoting joint action as well as the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The Ministerial Council reviewed the Israeli practices of aggression against the Palestinian people , especially the escalation against towns , villages and camps , and the policy of closures and economic and political blockade being pursued by Israel against the fraternal Palestinian people demanding the restoration of its legitimate rights , including the right of return and its right to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
The increasing problems of organized crime , illegal trafficking , economic stagnation and political instability can be adequately dealt with only within a regional framework and with a unified international approach .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirm that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political process , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ;  
In doing so , I recalled the expectations of the international community for rapid progress by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian Governments on the implementation of the political , economic and social confidence-building measures set out in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian plan for the region , independent of other progress in negotiations with the ethnic Albanian representatives .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) United Nations organizations are willing to cooperate ; ( b ) all parties concerned display the necessary political will ; ( c ) sufficient human and financial resources are available ; and ( d ) the economic and political situation of African countries is stable .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Also reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Strongly reaffirm that States which pursued racist policies or acts of racial discrimination such as slavery and colonialism should assume their moral , economic , political and legal responsibilities within their national jurisdiction and before other appropriate international mechanisms or jurisdictions and provide adequate reparation to those communities or individuals who , individually or collectively , are victims of such racist policies or acts , regardless of when or by whom they were committed ;  
The major political commitment of States is to take enhanced international action against corruption , through existing instruments , a new binding global legal instrument against corruption and other measures .  
The transition to a child rights approach can be hampered by : conservative economic and social policies characterized by paternalism and political patronage ; the insufficient capacity of local-level bodies to assume the new responsibilities ; the continued application of archaic law regarding minors ; resistance to child rights concepts by executive , legislative and / or judicial officials ; and the absence of valid , timely and relevant data and indicators on the fulfilment and violation of rights .  
Although a few women have achieved high social status in modern political , economic or professional life , the situation of the average woman , especially in rural areas , remains dire .  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Strongly condemns extremist violence in certain municipalities in southern Serbia and welcomes the plan of the Federal and Republic Governments to resolve the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia peacefully , including political and economic reform designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society , and calls for a rapid implementation of the plan ;  
Stresses however its deep concern about the continued repression of members of the political opposition and about the detention of dissidents and all other persons detained or imprisoned for peacefully expressing their political , religious and social views and for exercising their right to full and equal participation in public affairs , and calls upon the Government of Cuba to release all those persons ;  
In collaboration with UNICEF and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the Government was instituting peace and reconciliation initiatives , and considered that there was a need to assess and remedy the emotional damage suffered by traumatized children and to adopt an integrated , action-oriented approach which combined the elements of social policy , political will , economic commitment and efforts to mobilize adequate funds .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
The Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Council in its resolution 11 ( II ) of 21 June 1946 to prepare recommendations and reports to the Council on promoting womens rights in political , economic , civil , social and educational fields and to make recommendations to the Council on urgent problems requiring immediate attention in the field of womens rights with the object of implementing the principle that men and women shall have equal rights , and to develop proposals to give effect to such recommendations .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999 , decided to convene a high-level international intergovernmental event , involving political decision makers at least at ministerial level , to consider national , international and systemic issues relating to financing for development in a holistic manner in the context of globalization and interdependence .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;

Reaffirms that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives , and that in order to achieve this , full popular participation , equity , social justice and non-discrimination should be strengthened ;  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .  The conference should define the political principles to be applied at both the national and the international level , as well as the collective objectives and goals to be attained and the means needed to accomplish this .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
Reaffirming its commitment to the process of democratization of States , and recognizing that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
The period following his election , until his inauguration as President on 7 February was marked by a concerted civil society effort to promote political dialogue ; questionable opposition moves to form an alternative government ; and a climate of tension and threats accompanied by intermittent bombings .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;

While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Underscore the need to promote strategies , programmes and policies , which may include measures of affirmative action , for furthering the fulfilment of civil and political rights for victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including through more effective access to the political , judicial and administrative functions of institutions , as well as the need to increase access to the administration of justice in all its forms , free from racial discrimination of any kind ;  
Urge States to reaffirm their democratic commitment and take the necessary legislative , administrative and judicial measures , in accordance with their obligations under regional and international human rights instruments , to condemn and actively discourage all forms of propaganda , publicity , organizations , associations , political parties or groups inspired by ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or ethnic group and that seek to justify or promote racial hatred , xenophobia or racial discrimination ;

Urge those States in which the political and legal systems do not reflect their multiracial , multi-ethnic , multilingual and multicultural realities to review those systems , in consultation with representatives of the affected groups , with a view to improving democratic institutions so that they are more fully participatory and avoid marginalization , exclusion and discrimination of specific sectors of society , including indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other victims of racism ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in preparing his analytical report on the progress made in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 55 / 188 of 20 December 2000 , to devote a separate section of the report to a global study on the illegal transfer of funds , especially funds derived from acts of corruption , and the impact of the illegal transfer of funds on economic , social and political progress , in particular in developing countries ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
Weaknesses in some national laws , regulations , licensing procedures and enforcement mechanisms are exacerbated by lack of capacity , insufficient political will , inconsistent approaches and inadequate coordination and cooperation at the national , bilateral , regional and global levels .  
It is anticipated that more countries will be able to follow this positive lead in confirming increased contributions to regular resources for 2001 and beyond , thereby enabling UNDP to build on and start to harvest the financial dividend of the renewed political support to UNDP , within the context of MYFF .  
That same political commitment to an enhanced regular resource base for UNDP is again reflected by the fact that a number of programme countries have pledged to the regular resource base of the organization , often despite considerable internal constraints . 
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
UNICEF expects that its efforts to refine and improve its long tradition of results-based management , including the reporting on results to its Executive Board and donors , combined with reinvigorated political will resulting from the special session of the General Assembly on Children to be held in 2001 , will soon bear fruit in terms of a more predictable and positive growth of regular resources income .  
Within the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council , and at major recent international conferences , Governments have acknowledged the significance of cooperatives as associations and enterprises through which citizens can effectively improve their lives while contributing to the economic , social , cultural and political advancement of their community and nation .  
In summary , we can say that the main provisions contained in the Constitution are the following : political pluralism , separation of and collaboration among the legislative , executive and judicial powers , the right of all citizens to protection and to develop and express their ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious identity .  
When the States adhered to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in 1996 , they pledged to respect and guarantee to all individuals living in their territory , and who are under their jurisdiction , the rights recognized by the Covenant with no discrimination based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , social status , birth , or any other criteria .  
Since the beginning of its existence as an independent nation , the Argentine Republic has demonstrated , through actions by the Government , the firm political determination to exercise its effective sovereignty in the southern territories and maritime areas inherited from Spain .  
This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
At the regional level , ECA and ESCAP , in collaboration with the UNAIDS secretariat , have held special events in support of the global initiative and in preparation for the special session of the General Assembly , with ECA having organized an African Development Forum at the highest political level focusing on Africas needs to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .  
The attitude of the Congolese people , as reflected by a wide range of civil society organizations , religious groups and opposition political parties whom the Council mission met in Kinshasa and elsewhere , suggests that the country is eager to move forward towards national reconciliation , democratization and development , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a climate of political plurality .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity .

Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
However , persistent political tension along Guineas southern borders and the resultant prolonged presence of refugees , especially in the rural areas , have been putting tremendous pressure on its natural resources .  
In implementation of the instructions of the leaders of the GCC States framed with a view to promoting joint action to achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region and strengthen security and stability , the Ministerial Council reviewed the outcome of the meetings of the ministerial and technical committees and the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
In addition , under article 7 ( h ) , [ p ] ersecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law is also considered a crime against humanity .  
The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child guarantees the rights therein to every child and states further that [ e ] very child shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in this Charter irrespective of the childs or his / her parents or legal guardians race , ethnic group , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national and social origin , fortune , birth or other status ( art . 
Any approach to combating discrimination against non-citizens should take into account several critical factors including different categories of non-citizens ( e.g . permanent residents , temporary residents , undocumented aliens , etc . ) regarding different categories of rights ( e.g . political rights , civil rights , right to education , social security , other economic rights , etc . ) in countries of different levels of development and offering differing rationales for such distinctions ( e.g . issues of national reciprocity ) .  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
Specifically designed to ensure an inclusive approach , the JWG is composed of representatives of the three major Kosovo Albanian political parties , a Kosovo Serb member ( who withdrew following the initial session and was replaced on 13 April by another representative of the Kosovo Serb community ) , a Bosniac who represented Kosovos other minority communities , a representative of civil society and an independent expert , as well as seven international members , including an international chairman .  
Following an exhaustive search and interview procedure that won compliments from Kosovo political leaders for its transparency and the subsequent appointment of a new General Director of RTK and , the first tranche of funding from the European Agency for Reconstruction ( EAR ) for RTK was approved in March , and a tripartite agreement was signed among EAR , RTK and OSCE , which clarifies the responsibilities of each party for monitoring the performance and fiscal accountability of RTK .  
In view of the likelihood of a hot summer resulting from the criminal actions of extremist elements opposed to increased minority returns and the reconstruction of historic religious sites , my Special Representative is engaging intensively with political , religious and community leaders and police officials to seek a substantial improvement in their mutual cooperation as an essential element in improving police performance .  
The UNMIBH police commissioner project remains an essential institutional initiative for creating an apolitical police service , shielded from direct political interference from the ministries by functioning under a single chain of command led by an experienced police professional , designated Police Commissioner or Director of Police .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
There was a broad consensus that the most promising approach was to develop long-term and integrated strategies , combining a wide range of political , economic , social and other measures aimed at reducing or eradicating the underlying causes of conflict .  
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .

Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
Acknowledging that non-discriminatory legislation and protective laws create a supportive legal and political environment for the success of public health development and national HIV / AIDS prevention efforts , the Latvian Government revised and adopted an adequate legislative infrastructure .  
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
Noting with grave concern that Africa , in particular sub-Saharan Africa , is currently the worst affected region where HIV / AIDS is considered as a state of emergency , which threatens development , social cohesion , political stability , food security and life expectancy and imposes a devastating economic burden and that the dramatic situation on the continent needs urgent and exceptional national , regional and international action ;  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
However , it was also recognized that , apart from that statistical definition , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and socio-cultural circumstances .  
The mission , composed of representatives of the Department for Disarmament Affairs , the Department of Political Affairs and the UNDP Cambodia Office , visited Cambodia from 23 to 30 January 2001 and concluded that Cambodias fragile peace was indeed threatened by the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons , which not only destabilized the countrys delicate political balance , but also contributed to a dramatic increase in criminal activity and the attendant insecurity of the population . 
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We regret the existence of inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions in which intolerance and racial discrimination breed and fester , and we believe that genuine equality of opportunity for development is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
We also understand that discrimination contributes to inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions , and that genuine equality of opportunity [ for development ] is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We firmly believe that education , development and the faithful implementation of our international human rights norms / obligations , including enactment of laws and political , social and economic policies , are crucial to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Urges States to take the necessary measures to ensure that no person will be expelled , extradited or returned to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture or persecution on account of his or her [ race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ] racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic , or national origin [ or political affiliation ] ;  
Urges States to promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
To guarantee and promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
Urges States to acknowledge that the centuries-long slave trade , enslavement and other forms of servitude of Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples have resulted in substantial and lasting economic , political and cultural damage to these peoples and in the retardation of their institutions and societies , and that justice now requires that to alleviate the inequalities that still persist because of these shameful legacies , substantial national and international efforts be made .  
East Timor is a good example of the need for the international community to build on a successful peacekeeping intervention by laying the political , economic , judicial and constitutional foundations for lasting peace and security .  
Bearing in mind that corruption and the close social , economic and political links existing between employers of bonded labour and government officials at local level may be responsible for the perpetuation of this abhorrent practice ,  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
Since industrial environments such as shipping and ports undergo continuous technological , organizational and commercial change in a world which is changing continuously in respect of social and political structures , the evaluation and validation of courses - as well as the updating of instructors - must also be continuous .  Otherwise , an admirable system may end up teaching the wrong things !  
It also sought to secure the participation of organizations and institutions that are actively involved in the political , economic and social development of those Territories and of selected non-governmental organizations with long and established experience in island Territories .  
The representative of Venezuela stated that the points of view expressed during the Seminar provided an important reference for the Special Committee since they represented a key source of up-to-date knowledge and information that demonstrated the close relationship between the political , economic and social variables in every territory under consideration .  
The Special Committee therefore regards this regional seminar as a critical first step in this second International Decade , as we proceed to devise international strategies in a concerted effort to ensure that this sacred right to self-determination , this basic human right , is realized in all of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , so that the people might achieve their full political equality consistent with recognized international standards . 
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter that indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The obligation not to discriminate is an immediate duty and discrimination in access to food on the basis of race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status , as stated in article 2 , paragraph 2 , of the International Covenant , can not be justified under any circumstances , including low levels of resources .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
Clearly economic , social , cultural and hence nutritional situations tend to be extremely varied from one country to another and a model law would fail to address the problems experienced by people in their everyday lives and produce legislative solutions ill-adapted to legal and political systems in different countries .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The Special Representative calls for concerted efforts on the part of the National Election Committee , all political parties , non-governmental organizations , both local and international , and the international and donor communities , to guarantee that the commune elections are fair , transparent , and free from violence , and that sufficient and adequate voter information is properly disseminated .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
The current political process might seem slow , but the sensitive nature of the issues involved and the far-reaching implications for the countrys future made it vitally important that the National Convention proceed slowly and systematically in order to safeguard the interests of all the national races and to avoid replicating the shortcomings of the two previous Constitutions .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
The armed conflict in the north and the south-west , which forced most of the countrys development projects to a halt , and the unstable social and political situation prevailing in Ethiopia and Somalia have accelerated the deterioration of the Djiboutian economy .  
The previous report noted that the situation was worsening year by year , and described challenges in the area of sustainable human development resulting from the chronic instability of the countrys political , economic , social and security environment .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
Rather than using its political and moral authority to stir up hatred and violence , the Palestinian leadership must act , in accordance with its signed obligations , to halt all violence and terrorism directed against Israel , to end the relentless incitement in the media and by other authoritative figures and to restore an atmosphere of calm conducive to the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement .  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
The new Services will appropriately reflect the level of responsibilities of each of the Service chiefs , who act as the principal advisers to senior management within the Department and also support field operations on all technical and logistics support issues within their respective areas of responsibility for some 30 peacekeeping missions and independent political offices appointed by the Secretary-General .  
A number of interventions recalled article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986 , which stated that The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
He argued that indigenous peoples were effectively colonized peoples in the economic , political and historic sense and suffered unfair and unequal economic arrangements typical of other colonized peoples .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
Moreover , in the half-century that has elapsed since its establishment on the island of Taiwan , the Republic of China has seen significant political , economic and social development which renders it in practice an important member of the international community , as has been widely recognized at the global level .  
While the United Front has recently stated its commitment to a negotiated political settlement based on the right of the Afghan people to self-determination , a position supported by those Afghans supporting the convening of an emergency loya jirga , the Taliban remain of the view that the selection by ulemas of Mullah Mohammad Omar as Amir-ul Momenin with lifelong untrammelled powers has already adequately expressed the wishes of the Afghan people .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
I am convinced that a political solution based on the twin pillars of enabling the Afghan people to freely determine their own future and securing the legitimate national interests of Afghanistans neighbours through mutually binding commitments offers the best guarantee for a lasting peace in Afghanistan .  
On 31 July 2000 , the Government of Denmark reported that immigrants and refugees generally enjoyed legal equality with Danish citizens and , like all citizens , they were protected by law against discrimination on the basis of race , colour , religious belief , political observation , sexual orientation or national , social or ethnic origin .  
He recognized the interconnectedness of economics and politics and made a reference to the universally recognized understanding that all rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural , and the right to development are indivisible and interconnected .  
Since the 1990s , the society in Myanmar has been confronted by a slow and often painful pace of transition , with continuing unrest , political tensions , civil and political rights violations , a complex humanitarian situation and economic crisis .  
Stressing the need for the maintenance of regional and international peace and stability and friendly relations among all States , and underlining the overriding political , humanitarian and moral imperatives as well as the economic advantages of preventing the outbreak and escalation of conflicts ,  
To all the parties to the conflict , political parties and key sectors of civil society in the country : ( a ) that they commit themselves fully and in good faith to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue , avoiding pointless arguments and always keeping their eyes on the goal the establishment of a democratic , participatory system and full respect for civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
In particular , Parties have raised specific concerns regarding : ( i ) the competence of participants in the CST , ( ii ) the political nature of discussions within the CST , rather than a focus on scientific and technological issues , ( iii ) the lack of continuity of representatives to the CST , and ( iv ) inadequate time within the agenda of the CST to allow for in-depth analysis and debate of the issues .  
We must pledge today in a joint , coordinated and concerted way , and for the medium and long term as is expected of this Organization , to fulfil our moral , legal and political obligation to construct , for ourselves and for future generations , a legacy of democracy , freedom , peace and security .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has done important and indispensable work in recent years to build a consensus on the basic principle that terrorist acts , wherever and by whomever they are committed , are criminal and unjustifiable by any political , religious or philosophical considerations .  
In this regard , the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism , from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions .  On the national level , requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities , bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts .  
That phenomenon is terrorism , which requires the formulation of comprehensive international plans and approaches in the context of international legitimacy to confront international threats that do not discriminate on the basis of nationality , colour or creed , and which most certainly do not recognize any political , social , economic or geographical borders between States and peoples .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political , military , diplomatic , economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it . 
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
Through the efforts of UNOA and in particular of my Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa , as well as my Representative in Angola , broad contacts have been established with the Government , political parties , civil society , and the church which could provide a strong support base in the common search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict . 
Emphasizing also , as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme , that ecological crises facing humanity are deeply rooted in a complex web of political , economic , social , technological as well as inadequate societal attitudes , belief systems and perceptions ,  
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .  
He stated that SRRC was deeply committed to a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Somalia through dialogue and genuine reconciliation , which can enable all parties to reach a satisfactory political solution acceptable to all as outlined in the SRRCs Charter and Political Programme .  
One panellist considered that the success of European monetary integration had been favoured by the close trade ties among the countries involved and had been based on a unique and historically motivated political commitment by EU member States , which so far was still lacking in Asia , for example , and which in general was difficult to replicate elsewhere .  
The majority of those in academic circles who dealt with the issue of terrorism shared the opinion that terrorism meant the following : the use of or threat to use violence for political purposes ; a method of fighting or reaching specific goals based on intimidation of a society and government by causing human casualties and loss of property , characterized by ruthlessness and violation of moral and legal norms .  
Reaffirms that a strong political commitment by the international community is needed to implement strengthened and effective international cooperation and assistance for development , including social development , that the mobilization of domestic and international resources for development from all sources is an essential component of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action and of the further initiatives for social development ;  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
The radio will provide accurate , credible and impartial information about all aspects of the peace process , including military and political developments , the inter-Congolese dialogue and the many humanitarian assistance programmes operating in the country .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
The Security Coordinator also formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Secretariat on current and potential security-related problems , coordinates , plans and implements inter-agency security and safety programmes and acts as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation regarding security .  
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
In accordance with paragraph 2 of the resolution , our country is making steady and active efforts to prevent the use , in violation of decisions made by the relevant United Nations organs , of unilateral measures of economic and political coercion inconsistent with the norms of international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations as a means of applying pressure on independent developing States .  
The adoption of laws encouraging the use of unilateral coercive economic measures in order to achieve political objectives constitutes a flagrant violation of the rules of international law , particularly the principles , objectives and rules governing trade among nations .  
The use of coercive measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , whether unilaterally or under the auspices of regional and international organizations , poses a genuine threat to international peace and security and is in manifest violation of human rights principles .  
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
Despite the indivisible nature of Euro-Mediterranean security and despite the promises of partnership that have been reiterated on many occasions , the Mediterranean , as a recent declaration of the European Parliament declared , has become a zone that is a microcosm of the principal contradictions of the twenty-first century and is likely to produce irreversible demographic , economic , political and cultural divisions .  
At the crossroads of three continents , the Mediterranean is in a state of constant tension and must cope with major political , economic , ecological and demographic challenges , let alone a host of global social scourges that affect this region .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
Bridges should be built in the political , economic , financial , commercial , technical and social realm , and institutions should be strengthened at all levels , to facilitate such integration in a just and equitable process .  
It is time that the necessary political will is displayed by those countries whose ambiguous positions have led the Conference on Disarmament to its current comatose state , so that the Conference can be activated to fulfil its intended role as the single multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
The establishment of an effective , functioning government administration was fundamental to the comprehensive mandate given to UNTAET under Security Council resolution 1272 ( 1999 ) , and is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
It also welcomed the decision of the special session to intensify political commitment to close the gender gap in primary and secondary education by 2005 and to ensure free , compulsory and universal primary education for both boys and girls by 2015 .  
At the same time , many delegates stressed that democracy was inconceivable without human rights and , in particular , the rights of women , children and minorities , and that it requires the gradual expansion of political space in order to guarantee the full exercise of the political , economic , social and cultural rights of all .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
The two aforementioned international forums , the Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the Community of Democracies which will have its second major conference at Seoul in 2002 , play an important role in mobilizing the political will for advancing democratic values , principles and practices and ensuring that the lessons learned from democratization processes in various parts of the world will not be lost by future generations .  
In addition to the loss of life and physical damage , international terrorism led to political instability , which was inimical to harmonious development of States , and made it necessary to devote huge human and financial resources to combating that scourge and eliminating its consequences .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
Equally aware of the fact that older women , in all regions of the world , represent an important human resource , and that their contribution to society and development in the economic , cultural , political and social fields often remains unseen or unrecognized ,  
The General Assemblys political decision on the level of the regular budget was often arbitrary and sometimes appeared to be motivated by budgetary and economic trends in national Governments or by what Member States contributed to other United Nations operations or entities .  
Nevertheless , the United States and the United Kingdom , with logistic support provided by Turkey and with both logistic support and funding provided by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , are persisting undeterred in their contempt for the Charter of the United Nations and international law and are engaging in this cowardly terrorist aggression against Iraqi civilians and against Iraqs sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence .  
The sides have stated that an essential precondition for the transfer of the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan to the political channel is the unconditional fulfilment of the demands of the anti-terrorist coalition , including the handing-over of those who inspired and organized the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 in New York and Washington , D.C . , the abolition of the rule of the Taliban , who have provided shelter for terrorist and extremist groups on the territory they control , and the disbandment and complete disarmament of their armed units . 
The sides have expressed their strong conviction that the political process must be aimed at creating a widely representative government , including the representatives of all the peoples and ethnic groups concerned , to be formed as a result of the free expression of their will . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance , if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that persons race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that persons position for any of these reasons .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .

Meanwhile , they are also conducive to enhancing understanding , expanding common understanding , turning the party and government policies and principles into the majority of people 's conscious action , discovering and pooling the wisdom and experience of the masses , relying on the people to tide over difficulties and resolve problems , harmonizing the relationship in distribution of interests , eliminating social contradictions , and safeguarding and developing the political situation featured by unity and stability .  
What is worthy of attention is that because the proposition on " Taiwan independence " has never been accepted by the majority of the Taiwan people , those who have adhered to " Taiwan independence , " have , out of current political needs , asserted that " Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country , " and Taiwan has never been recognized as a part of China 's territory .  
The aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
Guangdong , which is in the forefront of reform and opening up , must all the more enhance understanding of the importance of " grasping things with two hands , with both hands firm , " tangibly strengthen ideological and political work , and launch an extensive and thorough education drive to " think of the source when getting rich , and advance in thinking when getting rich . "  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
It is necessary to establish and perfect a system , under the unified leadership of the party committees , in which the party and government departments and the mass bodies share the work and coordinate with each other and the leading cadres at all levels take on dual responsibilities in their posts ; it is necessary to establish a work mechanism for integrating ideological and political work with work in all aspects , and to form a good " integration " of mutual stimulation between them .  
CPPCC member Kong Lingren [ 1313-0109-0088 ] said : A perfect legal system has yet to be enforced by judicial officials who are steadfast in their political awareness , strict in discipline , honest and just , well-versed in professional knowledge and outstanding in their style of work .  Efforts must be made to strengthen the education and rectification of the judicial force .  
Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
Committee members focused on central tasks to serve the overall situation , and , from a perspective of pushing forward reform and opening , economic development , and safeguarding stability , earnestly performed their functions in conducting political consultation , exercising democratic supervision , and participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs , and offered many valuable suggestions and proposals , whose quality was better than last year .  
4 .  Article Nine of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall organize and mobilize their members to study Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory ( of building socialism with Chinese characteristics ) ; study current political affairs ; learn and exchange professional , scientific , and technological knowledge ; and enhance their abilities of serving the motherland .  
With a high sense of political responsibility , CPPCC members discussed major agenda , put forward many constructive views and suggestions on the administration of the country according to law , reliance on science and technology to invigorate the nation , sustainable development , great development of China 's western regions , reform of the state-owned enterprise , tackling of poverty , social security , democratic supervision , dealing with corruption , and maintaining social stability .  
While creating a model street for the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity , Hunan Road of Gulou District in Nanjing City incorporated ideological and political work as well as spiritual civilization construction into commercial enterprise management and business operation in a lively and tangible manner , producing a set of experiences in double civilizations construction and turning a shabby , cluttered , and unknown street into a golden business location , a shopping paradise , and a national model street of no fake goods in just a few years .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
Handed down through thousands of years , this strong national cohesion has neither weakened with the passage of time nor been shaken by the changes of dynasty and instead has become a lofty standard of value and passionate political belief that has taken root in the depth of the heart of every Chinese .  
Since the beginning of reform and opening up , the egalitarian system of eating from the same big pot in rural areas has been broken , households have become the main entities for economic operation and investment , and peasants have continuously increased their initiative in participating in the social , political , and economic lives .  
Deputy Wang Zhihao is deputy regimental commander of an air force aviation unit with glorious traditions .  This 34 year-old lieutenant colonel , who has been flying for 15 years , stressed : " As a result of training through science and technology in recent years , the overall quality of the air force has been greatly enhanced , while ideological and political education over a long period has rooted in our minds the idea that ' the interests of the motherland and the people are forever supreme . '  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Hegemonism is also manifest in the fact that the US annual Country Report on Human Rights Practices ignores the objective fact that human rights in China are improving all the time , and shows serious political bias in yet again attacking China at great length .  
Zhu Rongji said : Mr President is the Chinese people 's old friend .  We satisfactorily see that in the last 36 years since China and the Republic of Congo forged diplomatic ties , our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have been steadily and smoothly developing .  Sound cooperation full of positive results has been carried out in the political , economic and trade , public health , and educational fields .  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
First , it led the people to establish new China , thus putting an end to the history of being very much enslaved and plundered by foreign countries and savaged by one war after another and the masses living on the edge of starvation in old China and providing fundamental political premises , stable social environments , and excellent social conditions for the development of social productive forces in China .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
In some places and schools in our city of Beijing , there still exist the tendency to emphasize cultural knowledge study and to slight ideological and political education as well as the stubborn disease , of varying degrees of seriousness , of one-sidedly pursuing admissions rates and examination results and slackening ideological and political education as well as social practice activities .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
In international relations , China is opposed to the big bullying the small , the strong bullying the weak , and advocates building a new international political and economic order which is peaceful and steady as well as just and reasonable .  
According to Fu , China hopes that all the countries and nations in the world will undertake friendly cooperation , seek common development , establish a new , just , and rational international political and economic order , and realize lasting peace and common prosperity , and that the peoples of all countries can create and enjoy a happy life in accordance with their wishes .  
On solving the relationships between the central and local authorities , and between the Kremlin and various party factions , Putin has actively consulted with all leaders , striven to reach consensus , and successively promulgated relevant policies , so that Russia 's political situation would not sink into a chaotic situation before the election .  One after another , leaders of various parties and local leaders expressed their support for Putin 's presidential race .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The basic purpose of this " three stresses " positive education among all army 's Party organizations is through centralized and general education to practically strengthen grass-roots Party organizations ' cohesive force and combat capability , enhance Party members ' political steadfastness and ethical purity , bring into full play the grass-roots Party organizations ' role of fighting force and the exemplary vanguard role of the Party members , and further consolidate foundations of the Party 's absolute leadership over the army .  
Over the past several years , the CPC Central Committee centered on Comrade Jiang Zemin has been able to grasp the overall situation , engaged in scientific decision-making , and led the entire party and people of all nationalities nationwide in making efforts , resulting in the overcoming of political , economic , and natural difficulties and risks .  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
The " Honest Government Standards " formulated and implemented by the Party during the past few years have not only regulated political behavior for leading Party and government cadres under the socialist market economy , they also have advanced construction and development of the market economic system .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
conducted education and training with strenuous efforts , established and improved various forms of educational and training systems , and continuously raised the political and professional qualities and legal awareness of policemen , thereby effectively improving the fighting capacity of the public security force .  
Only when a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order is established , can sustained peace and prosperity be realized in the 21st century .  
We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
If the grass-roots party organizations fail to conduct effective ideological and political work , people may become listless , their minds may be confused , and the organizations may become loose and lax in management .  In such circumstances , profit-making enterprises and advanced units may inevitably collapse .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
Xu Zhigong has long been engaged in the work of political theoretical education and research .  Over the years , he has regarded the implementation of Chairman Jiang 's instruction of " arming the people with scientific theories " as his lofty mission , worked with ardent loyalty , studied assiduously , made innovations in a pioneering spirit , and has achieved remarkable results in the teaching and research of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
This article criticizes that the US advantages in the economic , political , military , and cultural fields are rapidly growing into a burden .  They have created tensions among old friends , weakened the US appeal to supporters , and made the United States face the danger of losing friends .  And this kind of friendly relationship is a " priceless treasure " accumulated over several decades .  
He noted that for decades , this movement has adhered to the aims and principles of independence , autonomy , non-alignment , and non-grouping , always devoting its efforts to defending the interests of the many developing countries , and actively promoting the establishment of a new just and rational international political and economic order , in an outstanding effort to promote peace and development for the human race .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
She is not an isolated individual .  She is the candidate chosen by the DPP and a political figure who is about to step up to the front stage in Taiwan . Hence , the remarks on splitting the motherland which she has spread through the media , are yet another political incident , following Lee Teng-hui 's two-state theory , that has seriously provoked China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Thus , they are more liable to the impact of erroneous ideas and bad phenomena .  In addition , reserve officers and men are scattered over many areas and are engaged in the work of various professions and trades .  Hence , the changes in their political attitude and ideological state are hard to be controlled .  
This is the marked difference between reserve forces and active military units .  To counter this , first political commissars of reserve forces must , when doing ideological and political work , embrace an advanced consciousness and must be fast in making judgement , in transmitting instructions , in giving feedback signals , and in tracking the results .  This is the only way to succeed .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , considerable progress has been made in bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in the political , economic , cultural , and other fields .  
Under the situation featured by the accelerated political multipolarization , economic globalization , and the dynamic advances in science and technology humanity is faced with not only rare opportunities for development but also grave challenges .  
Regional conflicts and local wars have broken out one after another .  There is not yet a fundamental change in the unfair and inequitable old international political and economic order .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
Hu Changqing lived a life of utter decadence and corruption and was not afraid to reveal his insatiable avaricious nature .  From that standpoint , to say that Hu Changqing hanged out with the rich and used his power to seek private gain was to put it politely .  In fact he was a complete political hooligan . "  
In contemporary history , the Palestinian people conducted hard and bitter struggles to defend their homeland and national dignity , restore their legitimate national rights and interests , and gain national liberation and independence , composing magnificent paeans .  Finally , they built autonomous political power on their own land .  And they are advancing toward a lofty goal of establishing an independent state .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
During reform and opening up as well as during its modernization drives , China has attached importance to and advocated the all-round development of people .  It not only emphasizes the social and economic rights of the people but also vigorously develops and safeguards the political rights of citizens , strives for realizing the " all-round human rights , " which include political rights , economic rights , social rights , and cultural rights as well collective rights and individual rights .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
After the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties , the friendship between the people of the two countries has continuously been consolidated and developed .  On the basis of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , the two countries have established sincere and firm relations , and have carried out extensive and fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and other fields , as well as in international affairs .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
He said : Following the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , the United States and some other Western countries have proceeded from the political need of promoting the Western social system and hegemonism , and therefore are extremely reluctant to see China adhering to the socialist path and extremely reluctant to see China adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , continuing to develop and becoming big and powerful .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
One political expert pointed out : During the years since Secretary of State Albright assumed her post , she has not at all had her own set of foreign policies or strategies to deal with the post-Cold War international situation .  She is merely an attendant who carries out US foreign policies .  In addition , on foreign affairs , she often focuses only on her native area of Europe , and adopts an attitude of much disdain toward Eastern and Southern Europe .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
The Chinese government practices a policy of respecting and protecting freedom of religious belief , pursuing the principle of keeping religion , political power and education separate .  The country protects normal religious activities , as well as the legal rights and interests of religious organizations .  The different religions have equal standing and live together harmoniously , and there is mutual respect and unified harmony between the citizens who practice religion and those who do not believe in any religion .  
Jiang Zemin said : The Chinese government implements the policy of respecting and protecting the freedom of religious beliefs , and follows the principle of separating religion from political power and education .  The country protects normal religious activities and the legitimate rights of religious groups .  Different religions in China share equal status , and co-exist in perfect harmony ; and religious believers and non-believers respect each other , and live together in unity and harmony .  
The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing long-term , stable friendly relations and cooperation with Greece and is ready to work together with the Greek side in further expanding and deepening cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields to constantly score new , great successes .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational , and new international political and economic order .  
China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational and new international political and economic order .  
and we should learn from them in taking a firm stance and clearly distinguishing between right and wrong , cherish the excellent situation of stability and unity , and resolutely wage struggle against phenomena that jeopardize ethnic solidarity , national security , and social stability , as practical deeds for preserving social and political stability .  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
The department has carried out rectification and reform at a deeper level , strengthened investigation and study , closely integrated " looking back " with " looking forward , " thought of , discussed and grasped big things , paid greater attention to future work , and further enhanced its political sensitiveness and ability to distinguish political matters .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
It can create " future " wars based on the general law of development governing hi-tech wars and by taking into full consideration China 's security posture , international influence , political and geographical environment , national characteristics , and other distinct features .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
In the process of ideological and political construction , we must take improving ideological and political qualities as the first task in cultivating high-quality talented military people ; meanwhile , we should insure students are competent in such aspects as science and culture , professional military skills , physical abilities and psychological qualities .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
It is necessary to maintain sharp vigilance against and prevent the infiltration and influence of reactionary political views spread by Western hostile forces , such as : the army should " not belong to a party " and should be " nonpoliticized . "  We should effectively strengthen education in the basic character and glorious tradition of our army , make the concept of " the party commanding the gun " take deep root , and ensure that the guns are always in the hands of those who are faithful to Marxism .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Through ideological and political work , we will enhance people 's ideological consciousness , promote good public conduct in society , solve various problems in people 's minds , facilitate communication and mutual understanding among the people , and thus coordinate interpersonal relations , mitigate various social contradictions , and maintain a stable and orderly condition in society while keeping all the vigor and dynamism .  
However , under the current material conditions , ideological and political work can solve problems in people 's minds to different degrees , can better give play to the initiative role of people 's mentality , and make up for the temporary shortage of the material forces with people 's mental forces .  This will prompt the people to create more material wealth .  
The party and government have attached great importance to the harm of piracy in society , and General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji have given important directives on " eliminating pornography " and " cracking down on illegal publications . "  Therefore , we must fully understand the importance of striking at copyright piracy from the high plain of national political , economic , and cultural aspects .  
He meticulously studied Deng Xiaoping Theory and learned a broad range of knowledge related with modern science and technology and ideological and political work .  He came up with a series of methods on how to lead soldiers in the new era , solved a series of problems that officials and soldiers face along their road of life , and promoted the progressive transformation of over a-hundred officials and soldiers .  
In his daily life , he was consistently clean in fulfilling his official responsibilities , without contamination at all .  He is considered an excellent political cadre who was the most convincing and the most authoritative in the eyes of the masses .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
On the world political arena , China , as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and the largest developing country , has a weighty international status and a positive , major impact on peace and development for mankind , which have won high international dignity and honor for itself .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
In the United States , debates revolving round the NMD program are turning hotter , and voices of opposition to it getting louder , in the military and academic circles .  In their public comments , many " celebrities " and knowledgeable personages in society have noted that technically this program has its inherent flaws and poses national security and political dangers .  
Because , as internal disputes are getting white hot and technical and political defects of the NMD program are being exposed daily , the US . Government 's confidence in this program is dropping lower and lower .  
This will be the first summit meeting held between the north and the south since the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 .  As a major breakthrough in north-south political relations , the summit meeting is expected to draw global attention .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
The Central Committee gives its full support to the Party 's basic line , continuing to uphold economic construction as the center , working hard to rectify the phenomenon of ' one hand rather hard , one hand rather soft ' , and strengthening ideological and political work and the building of the Party " .  
" Eliminating pornography and fighting illegal publications " is a matter of social stability , of the physical and mental health of our young , of economic order , and of our international image .  The struggle needs to be looked at from a political point of view , and it needs a great deal of emphasis .  
This is an important measure that the General Department of Politics took to carry out and implement Chairman Jiang 's important directive on improving the purposefulness , efficiency and creativeness of the military 's ideological and political work , and it is a lively and vivid textbook for the military to deeply promote the ideological and ethic education .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
All troops should associate singing these songs with ideological and political education , enthusiastically respond to Chairman Jiang 's call that " the military 's civilization construction should proceed at the forefront of the whole society " , make effort to become exemplary figures who put into practice , and enthusiastically spread this advanced ideology and culture .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
Upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army is always a main subject of our army 's ideological and political education .  After they join the army , the most important education service members receive is " military spirit " .  In the final analysis , when troop units hold lectures , publish blackboard newspapers , show motion pictures , stress traditions , and organize visits to sacred places of revolution , all such activities are closely linked to " the gun obeying the party " .  
Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .  Some generals personally give political lectures .  
He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .  
The Party 's grassroots organizations should profoundly solve the conspicuous problems arising in strengthening the leadership over ideological and political construction , in adhering to the principle of democratic centralism , in strengthening their sense of principles and their combat strength , in conforming to the system of regular activities at grassroots organizations , and in purifying the trend at the grassroots units .  
Through education on " the importance of studying , being political minded and being honest and upright " and education on party style and discipline , we should help the broad masses of party members and cadres foster a correct world outlook and concept of life and value and firmly resist material gains and commercialization in their political life .  We should help them clarify their thinking and distinguish between right and wrong and constantly strengthen their ability to repel corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
and for regular schools of higher learning to recruit regular senior high school graduates who are excellent both in character and learning in line with the directional enrollment plans of relevant state and military departments , make sure that they receive necessary military and political training while completing their college courses , and assign them to work in the military according to what they are trained for .  
Units at the military region level will establish offices composed of various functional departments to take charge of the training of reserve military officers .  Major duties of the offices are to organize and guide their subordinate units to select and train students of regular schools of higher learning , provide military and political training , and examine and recruit these students .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
( VI ) The party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program , and the brilliant achievements of reform , opening-up , and socialist modernization have enriched the connotation of patriotism , and raised the patriotic feelings of our nation , and aroused the entire people 's patriotic enthusiasm .  Over more than 20 years , our nation enjoyed political stability , economic growth , national unity ;  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
In the second half of 1995 , units at the grassroots level of the South China Sea Fleet stationed in the opening area of the special economic zone reflected that the original experience and methods of ideological and political work seemed to be unworkable now .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
The second signal company of a garrison district of a navy unit stationed in Shantou has often carried out " letting everyone talk " activities in promoting ideological work and encouraged fighters to mount on the stage of self-education .  Everyone can offer his opinions on specific topics and on methods to solve problems and make contributions .  In this way , the unit has promoted the " appropriate , systematic and creative nature " of ideological and political work through mass work .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
In local war , one strictly selects military and non-military targets and employs the most accurate and " humane " attack .  This tactic itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
They do not manage nor bother to know those issues affecting the personal interests and feelings of the masses and do not conduct patient and meticulous ideological and political work for giving timely guidance .  Some grass-roots party organizations are in a weak and slack state and do not display the roles they should in the ideological and political work .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
To study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we must get an ever clearer understanding of the requirements of the new situation for ideological and political work , enhance our sense of suffering , not lose sight of the importance of ideological and political work , foster the sense of urgency in doing a good job of the work , see of the protracted nature , complexity , and arduousness of the work , and make adequate mental preparations to carry out the work in the long term .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
In particular , during the magnificent 20th century , the people of Asia were indomitable in going all out to make their countries strong , composing a magnificent historical epic of their political awakening and economic upsurge and giving a powerful impetus to historical progress and social development .  
These principles have now become universal standards for country-to-country relations , playing a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the friendship and cooperation among developing countries in general , and they are and will continue to have an important impact on the promotion of the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
The new international political and economic order should be based on commonly-recognized standards of international relations , be suited to the development and progress needs of the age , and reflect the spirit of peace and equality , with all countries being equal regardless of their relative size , wealth , or strength .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
Okinawa is a Japanese prefecture in southern Kyushu and comprises Okinawa , Miyako , Yaeyama and other islands .  The main Okinawa Island is 1,185 sq km at the center of the Ryukyu archipelago .  Northern hilly areas account for two-thirds of the entire island .  Naha , the capital at the south of Okinawa Island , is Okinawa Prefecture 's political and cultural center .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
The Asian financial crisis has given us a practical lesson .  Financial security is no longer a pure economic issue .  It has a bearing on the political and social security of a country and is part and parcel of national security .  
A limited war is to strictly select military and non-military targets and employ the most accurate and " humane " attack .  The tactics itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
In diligently studying and understanding this important exposition , we have the profound feeling that only by firmly grasping the key points of strengthening and improving ideological and political work and working hard to enhance " one feeling three qualities " can ideological and political work provide formidable impetus and guarantees for reform and opening up and modernization construction in an atmosphere of continuing innovation and expanding advances .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
During the three major political struggles last year in particular , the educational leadership role of the news media was given full play , and waves of resistance to foreign aggression , protection of sovereignty , opposition of splittism , and strengthening of China were set off .  A healthy atmosphere in the whole society opposing superstition and resisting heretical teachings formed .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
Originally he planned on staying a night in the United States and expanding his impetus and influence and gaining political capital by publicly meeting US pro-Taiwan congressmen and local overseas Chinese ; the United States , however , was worried that it would get into a deadlock with China , and stressed that during his stopover the new leader " can not have any public agenda " .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
We must ensure first that they are qualified in the political sense , and second in a scientific and cultural sense , in professional skills and capacities and also in physical and psychological health .  We must further ensure that these experts have acquired comprehensive knowledge in various fields , overall coordination abilities , an innovative spirit as well as innovative capacities .  
To cope with the various challenges facing mankind 's survival and development , people strongly hope for the establishment of a new , fair and rational international political and economic order and the creation of an international peaceful environment that is safe and reliable and enjoys long-term stability and of an international harmonious situation in which countries make their own choices independently and seek common ground while reserving differences .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
We must clearly perceive the political conspiracy and sinister ambition of western hostile forces on the human rights issue , always remain politically sober and staunch , and shoulder our mission of protecting the nation 's security and unity .  
By grasping overall and key problems related to the comprehensive building of the grassroots party organizations , we can truly resolve problems in the grassroots party organizations that are of the nature of trends , ensure the effects and quality of " three stresses " education , and successfully achieve marked ideological improvement , marked political progress , marked transformation of work style , marked strengthening of discipline , marked progress in work , marked changes in quality , marked strengthening of the fortress role , and marked improvement in relations between officers and men .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The civilization and progress of the society , the vivid and lively political environment , and especially the socialist democratic and political life created and developed by the people under the leadership of the party have made people 's minds greatly tempered and increasingly mature .  
Along with the development of the social , political , economic , and cultural life , the independent and optional space for people 's ideological activities will become more extensive .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his noble character of selflessness , with which he has become a model of virtue for others , realized the true value of his life through making selfless dedications , and has retained the true political color of a communist party member .  
In the broad sense , saving oneself means to save your side 's material and mental strength , specifically including your side 's land , people , and actual political , military , and economic strength , as well as the nation 's or people 's will to resist , etc . , i.e . , what is commonly known as overall national strength .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
Generally speaking , cadres of our province are good .  Firm in political confidence , working hard , and with an incorruptible and realistic work style , they have made positive contributions to Sichuan 's reform and opening-up , economic construction , and social progress .  
In addition , we should firmly uphold the concept that " our cause is of utmost importance " and adhere to the principle of training cadres who have both ability and political integrity and the principle of making our cadre contingent more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more competent professionally .  The party 's line and policy concerning cadres should be fully and properly carried out , and the established standard should be strictly complied with in selecting and promoting young cadres .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
Since the historic meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and ROK , Kim Chong-il and Kim Tae-chung , held in mid-June in which the " North-South Joint Declaration " was signed , both sides have developed a series of exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , cultural , and other fields , with gratifying progress made .  
It is a pressing and important task with high requirements to conduct admonitory education with the serious cases of Cheng Kejie and Hu Changqing . Party committees at all levels must take admonitory education as a major political task , and fulfill this task by doing intensive and effective work with a strong sense of political responsibility , sufficient energy for exercising leadership , and a soaring morale and healthy mentality , thus guaranteeing that admonitory education achieve expected solid results .  
Ever since the beginning of reform and opening up , in particular , earthshaking changes have taken place in Sichuan . The province has deepened its reform , rapidly opened itself wider to the outside world , attained high-speed economic growth , brought about comprehensive progress to all its social undertakings , and has provided a comfortable living and working environment for its people .  The entire province is now enjoying a sound national unity , a stable political situation , and prevailing social stability .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
The people 's democratic dictatorship as a form of state and the people 's congress system as a form of government of what our country has been pursuing are the result of the people 's struggle and a historical choice made by the people .  They are the corner stone of our country 's political system which not only suits our country 's national conditions but also reflects the substantive requirements of socialism .  
At present and in a longer period to come , the old capitalist system will continue to surround the new socialist system .  The socialist system , which is young and pretty much immature , can only struggle to survive and seek development under the pressure of capitalist countries which are dominating over and enjoying a favorable position of strength within the framework of the old international political and economic order .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
how are we going to reform the old international political and economic order that is dominated by a small number of developed western countries and to build a new international political and economic order which is fair and reasonable ;  
Right after the layout revamping , they , having carried out meticulous planning , organized personnel from the internet center of the Navy 's political department to turn out the " New Revelation of Chinese Navy " and " Roaring Waves " , which are major features of a completely new style , and organized this newspaper 's editorial force to produce a feature of a strong journalistic character - - " ' Towering Giant ' of Chinese Men 's Basketball - - 1 August Team " .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
Therefore , it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the work of controlling the political and ideological conditions of the cadres .  In particular , it is necessary to set up concrete procedures and work out concrete standards and methods for assessing the political and ideological quality of a cadre .  The conclusion of the assessment should also be more specific and detailed .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .  He sought no privilege for himself and always maintained the distinctive political character of plain living and hard struggle .  
This afternoon , ministers from some 40 African countries in charge of diplomacy and economic and trade affairs gathered together with their Chinese counterparts in the Grand Banquet Hall of Beijing Hotel for the China-Africa Cooperation Forum - - Ministerial Conference 2000 .  They held a candid exchange of opinions and discussions on the two major themes of this conference : promoting the building of a new international political and economic order through China-Africa cooperation and further developing China-Africa economic and trade cooperation .  
This is not only an inevitable choice that developing countries must make in order to seek development in the new century , but also a driving force for building at an early date a new international political and economic order that is just and reasonable .  
This humorous remark elicited warm applause of all participants in the forum , which expressed the strong aspiration of developing countries toward building a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
Beijing University 's Xia Xueluan , a professor in the Sociology Department , pointed out that a few people supposedly originally practiced " Falungong " to keep fit and healthy , but they are now under the control and manipulation of ringleaders from foreign reactionary organizations , and they are embracing covert political aims to deliberately destroy the excellent condition of the country 's stability and unity .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
The flames of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea disappeared nearly 50 years ago .  Unprecedented changes have taken place in the international political structure and the world military arena .  However , the valuable experience gained from this war cuts through space-time , exceeds national boundaries , and becomes an extensive and precious historical textbook .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
Liu : First of all , we must ascertain that development is the main theme .  We are faced with the political pressure of international hegemonism , the pressure from the developed countries with their superiority in high technology , and our arduous tasks in China 's modernization drive .  Only by greatly raising our productive forces , can we build a material foundation to solve all kinds of social problems .  
A : We should also see that our country is faced with severe challenges amid international political and economic struggles and the fierce competition for comprehensive national strength .  
In order to establish a rational and just new international and economic order , our country must further reform in greater depth and win world respect and a favorable international political and economic environment with powerful economic strength and comprehensive national strength .  
In accordance with the requirements laid down in its five-year program , the division 's party committee has divided fighting capacity building into four major aspects , namely , political work , military work , logistical support , and equipment and technical support ; has tackled bottlenecks which prevent new-type equipment from turning into all-round fighting capacity by focusing on key and thorny issues ; and has laid a solid foundation step by step .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
This important directive was made from a long-term and broad perspective , through both dialectical materialism and historical materialism , and with an eye on the requirements for the development of the times .  This directive has set the direction for strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new period .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
This shows that the Government had held sufficient consultations with the Legislative Council and people were satisfied with the Legislative Council 's work efficiency and all these have laid a sound foundation for Macao 's social and political stability and economic development . 
and have improved social order to a significant extent , and this has created a favorable atmosphere for enlivening Macao 's tourism industry and has laid a necessary foundation or provided favorable conditions for creating an environment for Macao 's harmonious and stable political and social life .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
With history as a guide and the future as his orientation , he worked hard to reach a consensus with both the Japanese government and Japanese outside the government on deepening the partnership of friendship and cooperation between the two countries .  As a result , mutual understanding was deepened , the political foundation of bilateral relations was reinforced , and the development of friendly cooperation in all fields was given a boost .  At the same time , there remain in Japan the soil and climate for the growth of militarism .  
and the leaders of regional organizations .  President Jiang Zemin put forward a four-point proposal at the meeting designed to strengthen Sino-African cooperation and promote the creation of a new international economic and political order .  His proposal won universal praise from those in attendance .  
He discussed China 's principled stand on creating a new international political and economic order .  Like water pouring down a steep roof , his words powerfully reflected the heartfelt wishes of the peoples of all nations , particularly the numerous developing nations , for peace and development and were widely praised by the delegations .  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
The world is still not free from disturbance .  In face of the complicated situation in which international relations are undergoing profound adjustments , opportunities and challenges coexist , political parties of all countries , including the ruling , participating , and opposition parties , are keeping eyes on the 21st century in a bid to explore a development strategy that better fits the trend of the times and their respective reality .  
In the course of advancing their work in the key fields , trade unions at all levels actively assisted the party organizations and the local governments in doing effective ideological and political work among the working masses , carried out " economic and technical innovation projects " among the working masses , organized and guided workers to enhance their work skills , learn from the advanced , do a first-class job , and make greater contributions .  All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
Nonetheless , under the conditions of the socialist market economy and along with the gradual deepening of our country 's political or economic structural reform as well as the in-depth development of our army building , our present enlistment system governing officers in active service has turned incompatible with the needs of a new situation or a new task in certain aspects , and it is thereby imperative to replenish or amend the " Regulations " in an appropriate way .  
To impose one 's own favored undiversified model on others can only artificially destroy social and political ecological equilibrium , a course of action which is neither rational not feasible .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
Our undertaking of reform , opening up and socialist modernization has been pushed forward into a new stage .  In China today , it is a scene of political stability , economic development , national unity , social progress , constantly improving living standard , and prosperity .  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
It has been only 80 years since the time the first socialist state was founded , so most socialist states have a history of 40 or 50 years , which places them at the initial development stage .  Their economic , political , and social working mechanisms have not been completely developed and established , they still strive hard exploring how to fully develop the advantages of socialism .  
Practice has proven that since the actual foundations on which individual countries establish socialism vary , their methods of gaining political power vary , and their ethnic and national conditions vary , there can be no single model of development that fits every country .  
Just as a weak president is bound to face strong opposition in Congress , the White House and the Congress are bound to find friction or contradiction between them on a regular basis , and this will become a salient characteristic of the US political arena in the future .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
Ways , means , and methods which are receiving widespread application are continuing and improving classroom education , " second classrooms , " on-line political work , cultural improvement , psychological guidance , standardizing laws and discipline , self-education , benefits driving , improving the level of education in science , and leaders taking the lead and setting the example .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
The two sides unanimously held that the five principles of peaceful coexistence , which were advocated by the two countries 47 years ago and have subsequently been widely recognized and practiced by the international community since then , are still shining in resplendent fashion and maintaining powerful vitality today , and represent the cornerstone in building a new international political and economic order .  
One of the important issues in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to correctly deal with the influence of the international environment and the international political struggle on people 's thoughts in the course of persistently carrying out reforms , opening up , and increasing economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world , while actively absorbing and learning from all the good results achieved by human society as a whole in civilization development , and effectively resist the corrosive influence of the decadent ideologies and cultures from the West .  
However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
The distinct ideology and culture with unique characteristics developed by each nation over a long period of time in history is now being interwoven with the ideologies and cultures of other nations .  This distinctiveness reflects the interweaving and merging of a modern ideology and culture which was derived from industrialization , the traditional ideology and culture , and the interweaving and merging of the ideologies and cultures that represent the fundamental political and economic interests of different nations .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella . "  They have tried by hook or by crook to infiltrate into party and government organizations to seek political protection even to the point of directly seizing political power .  This is an extremely dangerous signal .  It is terribly harmful .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
Li Hongzhi 's repeated spread such fallacies as " making perfect accomplishment of rising to the Heavens , " " disregarding life and death , " " moving toward perfect accomplishments , " and all of this was sheer nonsense and heresy aimed at deceiving and instigating those obsessed and being controlled to act desperately as his " cannon folder " or sacrifices for his sinister political schemes . 
After the inside story of a cult has been exposed and its crimes brought to the light of day , the cult master never hesitates to regard the lives of his followers as sacrifices and political gambling stakes and lures them into committing mass suicide or causing terrorist incidents such as kidnapping , assassination , releasing poison , or causing explosions , in order to shock the world by antisocial and antihuman actions . 
It has been disclosed that the Clinton Administration doubted if the Iraqi opposition organization was able to overthrow the Saddam regime .  But , just before he left office , he approved the establishment of a political fund as much as $ 12-million for the purpose of aiding Baghdad 's opposition forces .  The fund will mainly be used to establish radio stations , carry out various kinds of subversive activities , and investigate war crimes committed by senior Iraqi officials .  
The pro-Taiwan forces in the United States , who have called themselves " the blue unit , " have also advanced quite a few political propositions marked by strong ideological colors , and this has undermined the US-China relations ' healthy development and has frequently contravened the US strategic interests as well .  
Since hostile forces and saboteurs at home and abroad seize every opportunity and try by hook or by crook to steal China 's political , military , economic , cultural , and educational intelligence , cases of leakage of secrets are frequent and startling , posing a serious threat to the information security of the party , the state , and the military .  
Therefore , it is essential that we further expose and criticize the false reasoning and heretical teachings of " Falungong " in order to further uncover the political nature of " Falungong " and the severe harm it causes , and to drive out evil and usher in the good so as to ensure total victory in this battle .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
We must closely unite around the Central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the mighty banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , further raising awareness , following up each victory with fervent pursuit , and resolutely removing and discarding the " social tumor " of " Falungong " , in order to consolidate and develop the stable and united political situation of our nation as well as to ensure the successful progress of liberalized reforms and the undertakings of modernized construction .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
They should train and bring up a contingent of high-quality leaders of different types at various levels who are firm in their political stand , manifest new pioneering spirit and possess modern scientific , educational and managerial knowledge as well as a contingent of specialty technicians and economic managerial personnel urgently needed in our region .  
In the political sphere described by Putin as the " crux of Russia 's rejuvenation , " Russia has , by means of the Federal Constitution , straightened out the relations between the central authorities and various republics , oblasts , and border regions ; curbed the separatist tendency of local regimes ; and severely cracked down on the separatist attempt by illegal armed groups in Chechenya , initially restoring a powerful state power system .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .  
The reporter has learned that these units that were evaluated as tops in training have several clear features : Their major military and political officers are all outstanding commanders , having top overall comprehensive quality , and very strong command and control training ability .  
The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
The starting point of this assumption ( namely , guarding against the threat of missile attacks ) of the United States failed to convince Germany . A considerably large number of personages from the military and political circles believed that this is not reasonable .  Because during the Cold War period , the threat of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union to West Europe was many , many times bigger than it is now , did not the East-West balanced posture based on nuclear deterrent ensure the security of Germany ?  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
Persisting in focusing on economic construction and greatly liberating and developing the social productive forces are the largest political missions for China at the present time and reflect the basic interests of the people across the country , including the vast majority of members of the united front .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
We hope various levels of party committees and governments across the autonomous region will earnestly put into effect the party 's policies toward agricultural and pastoral areas and unite and lead the broad masses of cadres to develop production , improve living standards , " bring social order out of chaos , " and " tackle problems caused by stupidity , " so that our region will advance by leaps and bounds and achieve prolonged political stability .  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
The good situation has been pioneered by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  The ideological and political foundation , the material and technical foundation , and the mass foundation , that we have already possessed to realize the three major historical tasks in the new situation , have been laid by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
Ideological and political building has been further enhanced , preparations for military struggle have been thorough and sound , notable success has been achieved in national defense scientific research and armament modernization , all-round backup capability has been markedly strengthened , and there has been a very big improvement in the army 's all-round combat capability in hi-tech conditions .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .  In the face of the complex situation at home and abroad , our army held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and resolutely obeyed the commands of the CPC Central Committee and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; ideological and political building was further stepped up ;  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
The Consulate General of the People 's Republic of China Consulate in Chicago and the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , the largest independent , non-profit international affairs organization in the Midwest , recently held a joint reception at the Chinese consulate , which was attended by nearly one-hundred persons including members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , as well as persons from political , commercial , academic and media circles . 
We should help our cadres raise their political ability in appraising things , maintain a sober mind in the face of a complicated situation , and be bold and courageous while be prudent like standing on the edge of a cliff or ice .  
Deputies pledged to carry forward the spirit of incessant struggle advocated by President Jiang , have a high sense of political and historical responsibility , strengthen army building in an all-round way , and score good results in the two historical subjects of " winning the battle " and " never changing color " .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
The fact that under the staunch leadership of the party , the anti-separatist struggle in our region has turned from the state of passively meeting an emergency to one of taking the initiative to tackle problems in a comprehensive way and that our social and political situation remains stable shows that the 2.6-million people of all ethnic groups , the main body in the struggle against the separatist clique headed by the Dalai , are carrying out this struggle with strong determination , redoubled confidence , and high morale until they win a complete victory .  
At present , with the kind attention of the central authorities and the vigorous support of the people of the whole country , the people of all ethnic groups in our region are firmly seizing the rare opportunity provided by the stable political situation and the large-scale development of west China and , with unprecedented enthusiasm and drive , striking up a magnificent movement of leapfrogging development .  
The vast majority of these comrades are young in age , good in political quality , highly educated , possessing of strong professional ability , broadminded , ideologically emancipated , highly conscious of reform , and down-to-earth in style of work .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .  
In light of the numerous conjectures about China 's timetable on joining the WTO , Zhang said : China is ready to make joint efforts with the WTO members to finish the talks at an early date , but it is hard for the Chinese side to predict a specific timeframe for its accession because this does not depend on China alone but on the 140 WTO members , especially on the political desire of some developed countries . 
In a country which originally does not have a strong religious awareness , while reaffirming man 's right to freedom of faith , we must also let our kindhearted people know how high a cost the Western world has paid in blood and how protracted and arduous a struggle it has gone through in its pursuit of a peaceful coexistence between religion and rationality and in its effort to gradually bury the various extremist religions and political propositions .  
As China is a developing country as well as a major country which brooks no neglect in the political and economic life in the world .  Because China conducts a lot of international trade , when the trade talks involve concrete conflicting interests among the parties , everybody wants to hold the negotiations in a more explicit and detailed manner .  
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
Yang stressed that China 's accession to the WTO will have a profound impact on China 's economic and even political and social life and that the existing administrative and management concepts , systems , structures , methods , and means need to be transformed in an in-depth manner .  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
Article 37 All units shall do a good job in selecting , assigning , training , or appointing military scientific research personnel ; introduce or refine an incentive mechanism ; give full scope to enthusiasm or creativity on the part of research personnel ; and work hard to build a high-quality contingent of military scientific research personnel , including both full-time and part-time personnel , who are known for political integrity , professional proficiency , a rigorous style , and a rational structure .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
But it still goes back to the same old question , that is , without the initiative of civil society , without the basis of full-scale economic division and full-scale division of social interests , and without the existence of a lenient and compromising political culture that is organically associated with such division of the socio-economic structure , it will end up with the same predicament of " quasi-multiparty system " in the early ROC years if what we have is merely the aspiration for the superficial efficacy of multiparty system .  
To be more specific , the ideology of an all-embracing government takes the goal conception of equalitarianism as the basis of social integration , whereas in the case of post-omnipotenism with Chinese characteristics , political integration is primarily founded on the authority of the state apparatus and the system , yet the utopian " political myth " embodied in a dogmatic ideology has already been abandoned , and efforts have been made to try to gain the people 's recognition of state power with " practical economic results . "  
To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
Wang Shijie stressed : In the new century , various countries should promote democratization of international relations and establish a new international political and economic order that is fair and just .  They should ensure that the broad masses of developing countries have the right to equally participate in the decisions on global economic affairs .  
Chen Shui-bian 's burning task at the moment is to find out , externally , a highly adaptable political medium who has a diversified attribute and a low and incorruptible political feature , just like the old Siew . In addition , Chen Shui-bian should continue to have Yuan-tseh Lee [ Li Yuan-che ] , a renowned scholar refusing to associate with officials of doubtful reputation , reinforce the consensus within the country .  After this , he will be able to launch an attack in the chess game .  
The building of national defense is an important part of the great cause of the party and the country and various sectors have attached great importance to it .  Politically speaking , it is in a high and glorious position .  Besides , it is guaranteed with powerful ideological and political work and the conditions for political life is favorable .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
Because of all this , it has become a top priority for the Chinese in the post-Deng era to diligent pursue the establishment of effective supervision mechanisms suited for China 's national conditions and to promote democratic system innovation in a situation of relative political stability , so as to prevent China from being trapped in endemic corruption and an " emergency room paradox " resulting from the dilemma created by the contradictions . 
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
He said that under the current international situation of multipolarization and economic globalization , the developing countries should intensify unity and coordination , cope with all problems in a positive attitude , and make concerted efforts to establish a fair , reasonable new international political and economic order .  
At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .  To retort , Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai pointed out in all seriousness that the United States was keen to dish out human rights motions against other countries , wantonly attacked other countries ' political systems by flaunting the banner of " safeguarding human rights , " tried hard to turn human rights issues into political issues for achieving its political purpose of exerting pressure onto other countries .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
Brazilian Ambassador Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto said that Brazil and China are two important developing countries , adding that the two countries have had good ties of political cooperation and take an identical or similar stand on major international affairs .  He said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries would further cement bilateral relations and deepen mutual understanding and consensus between the two peoples .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
To carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things , it is necessary to build a contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
Party committees and governments at all levels must provide the political and legal front with carefully selected cadres , who are ideologically and politically sound , proficient in professional work , bold and resolute , and able to meet the needs of the political and legal front , and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels of the political and legal front .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that by making arrangements for unfolding a nationwide struggle to " strike hard " and put things right , the national public order work conference fully expressed the strong resolve of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to preserve social and political stability and the fundamental interests of the masses , and this will have a major and far-reaching impact on ensuring the smooth progress of China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization and achieving lasting political stability in the country .  
The leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility for comprehensively implementing the party 's basic line and adhering to the four cardinal principles ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on major issues of principle , keep clear heads amid complex struggle , strengthen their political sensitivity and political distinguishing ability , and wage resolute struggle against all phenomena that jeopardize party and state interests .  
Addressing the general debate at the 105th Conference of the Inter Parliamentarian Union on 4 April , Jiang Zhenghua , vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , called on the international community to promote the process of political multipolarity , capitalize on the opportunity of economic globalization to achieve common development and prosperity for all countries , and establish a new , peaceful , stable , fair , and rational political and economic world order in the new century .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
- - All developing countries strengthen unity , make joint efforts toestablish a fair and reasonable international political and economic new order.Strive to advance democratization in international relations ;  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Commenting on the issue of building a new international political and economic order , Jiang Zemin pointed out : The new international political and economic order should be built on the basis of the Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence - - mutual respect for each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other internal affairs , equality and reciprocity , and peaceful coexistence - - and other universally acknowledged norms governing international relations .  
All localities and all departments must keep a strong sense of political responsibility and the spirit of being highly responsible to the interests of the people , carefully organize their actions according to the unified arrangements of the central leadership , take effective measures and achieve solid results in restoring a regular and orderly condition of the market so that the people can be satisfied and can set their minds at rest .  
It was not long before China 's underworld organizations and evil forces rapidly spread and become rampant throughout the country .  They have seriously endangered the people 's life , infringed upon their property , undermined their security and threatened the political , economic , and social stability of the country .  
Jiang Zemin said : " Uruguay is beautiful and fertile .  It has long-term political stability and sustained economic development .  The people 's living standard has continued to rise and the country has played a positive role in international affairs .  
Jiang Zemin said he was pleased to see that in the 13 years since China and Uruguay established diplomatic relations , the two countries have increasingly enhanced friendly cooperation in political , economic and trade , and cultural fields , and the two peoples have continued to deepen their mutual understanding and friendship .  
Different countries differ not only in their geographical location but also in their level of economic development and historical and cultural traditions .  Thus , they are bound to have different political , economic and social systems , and it is unrealistic to achieve unification using one and the same model .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
The fact that our party has put forward the need to serve as a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and taken the realization , development , and safeguarding of the people 's fundamental interests as the ultimate aim of all its political activities fully demonstrates the organic integration of the party 's advanced nature with the extensive nature of the masses .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
People of countries the world over , politicians , political parties , social groups , and media of many countries including the United States , and overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have made speeches and published articles supporting the Chinese Government 's just stance and the spirit of struggle in showing no fear of mighty power , attacked the unreasonable and unjustified US attitude , and exposed the US conspiracy to trample on the sovereignty of other countries and establish world hegemony .  
Based on the principle of making active strikes against crimes and of cracking down on crimes whenever they occur , Xinjiang has maintained high pressure on national splittists , violent terrorist groups , and religious extremists and has thwarted their splittist activities several times , thereby realizing political and social stability for Xinjiang .  
Being the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres , China and Brazil have the duties to play a positive role in propelling the healthy development of the world political and economic situations .  
Intensifying coordination and cooperation and deepening the strategic partnership between China and Brazil is of vital significance to augmenting the strength of the developing countries as a whole and giving impetus to the establishment of a fair , rational new political and economic order in the world .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
We must fully understand the importance and urgency of doing a good job of public security work , earnestly implement the " strike hard " principle and various measures for comprehensive management of social security , which were formulated by the central authorities , and create a sound social environment for the state 's long-term political stability and economic development .  
We must build , in accordance with the requirement of " enforcing laws strictly and rendering warmhearted service " that was set by General Secretary Jiang , our contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
Although outsiders were worried that the influence of the Liberation Army would override the diplomatic system in the process of making diplomatic policy decisions or worried that without such authoritative political leaders as Mao and Deng , Jiang Zemin might not be strong enough to have the overall situation in his hand and might not make a final decision on releasing the American crew members , the Chinese Communists still proved with their action that Jiang Zemin was able to bring everything under his control .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
Guided by revolutionary theory , he plunged into the practice of revolutionary struggle with tremendous political fervor and outstanding courage and insight , and engaged in pioneering practice and exploration in party building , theoretical propaganda , united front work , mass work , and armed struggle ; in these he made outstanding contributions and fully displayed the leadership talent of a politician and social activist .

A Communist China official confirmed that since 18 March last year , Chang Yung-fa , who is an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian , had been unable to visit the mainland due to political reason .  However , after " understanding " Chang Yung-fa has " once again " reiterated his stance of supporting the three direct links with the mainland , the Communist China 's leader approved Chang 's business trip to the mainland .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .

Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is a country with beautiful mountains and rivers and rich natural resources .  The diligent and courageous Venezuelan people are endowed with glorious historical traditions .  At present , under the leadership of President Chavez , the Venezuelan Government and people are making vigorous efforts to push forward political , economic , and social reform ;  
He died a heroic death to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  He loved the party , loved our Army , loved his work as a pilot , worked hard and practiced diligently .  He was an outstanding pilot with high political quality and professional proficiency .  
When selecting candidates , we should consistently adhere to the standards and strictly guarantee the political quality of those to be promoted .  Outstanding female cadres who can fully , correctly , actively implement the party 's basic line , persistently take the role of socialism with Chinese characteristics , can distinguish the right from the wrong on major principle issues , and can withstand tests at critical junctures should be selected and promoted to leading bodies .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
President Jiang Zemin began his visit to the six Latin American countries on 5 April and he visited Chile , Argentina , Uruguay , Brazil , Cuba and Venezuela one after another .  During his visit to the six countries , President Jiang Zemin separately held talks with the heads of state and met with leaders of the parliaments and political parties of these countries , had a deep exchange of views with them on developing bilateral relations and on international issues of common concern , and reached extensive consensus .  
Li Zhaoxing finally said : President Jiang 's visit to Latin America is one of historical significance , for it has forcefully furthered the Sino-Latin American friendly cooperation in an all-round way in the new century ; has expanded China 's influence in the world ; and is of vital significance and far-reaching influence to enhancing unity and cooperation among the broad masses of developing countries and to facilitating the establishment of new , fair , and reasonable political and economic order in the world .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
Under new circumstances , the political struggles and tests facing officers and men are mainly tasks in daily life , and they rarely experience major personal struggles .  Consequently , some comrades may easily become less politically aware , fail to notice disturbances in their peaceful life , and not be politically vigilant against infiltration of hostile forces .  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
This thinking is a succinct summary of the correct world outlook , outlook on life , and concept on value for the communist party members , which has reflected the demands on cadres by the new situation and tasks , and embodied the unity in the criteria for political integrity and professional competence .  
Comrade Wang Enmao , an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China , a tested and loyal fighter for communism , a proletarian revolutionary , a brilliant political leader of the party and the army , and a vice chairman of the Sixth and Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , passed away at 10:45 on 12 April 2001 in Beijing , after his illness failed to respond to any medical treatment .  He was 88 years old .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
and he was a recidivist .  In accordance with the relevant provisions of the criminal law , Shijiazhuang Intermediate People 's Court sentenced Jin Ruchao to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of causing explosions and , separately , sentenced him to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of voluntary manslaughter .  It ruled that the death penalty be executed and his political rights deprived for life .  
Vietnam has witnessed political and social stability , sustained and rapid economic advancement , remarkable changes in all sectors , gradual improvement of people 's life , and continued advancement of its international status .  The country has entered a new historic period of industrialization and modernization .  
we must learn his high degree of political awareness and dauntless heroism of firmly bearing in mind the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people , being courageous and firm , boldly marching forward , and pledging his life to safeguard national sovereignty and national dignity .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
Those who deviate from the party 's basic line and behave in a double-dealing manner , those who fail to stand tests at critical moments of the political struggle or hold an ambiguous attitude in an attempt to dodge the struggle , those who disregard the interests of the party and the people and are only keen on seeking personal fame and power through getting official positions by means of bribery or currying favor with influential people or playing defrauds must not be allowed to enter leading bodies .  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
Li Lanqing said : One of the main purposes of my current visit to France is , while pushing forward political and economic cooperation between China and France , to boost development of cultural exchange and cooperation between the two countries - - this is extremely important and indispensable to promoting the comprehensive partnership between our two countries .  
The Japanese Government has ignored repeated solemn representations of the Chinese Government and calls for justice from within Japan and decided on the evening of 20 April to issue a Japanese visa to Lee Teng-hui , on the excuse of so-called " humanitarian grounds " and " non-involvement in political activities and being limited to medical purposes , " thereby giving the green light for Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan .  
However , it is noteworthy that Taiwan political figures one after another have jumped forward to apply pressure to the Japanese side and asked for a visa for Lee Teng-hui .  This has fully exposed Lee Teng-hui 's complete ulterior motives in eagerly seeking to travel to Japan for " medical treatment . "  In fact , this is a political plot meticulously planned and directed by the " Taiwan independence " forces , with Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian as their representatives .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
The contacts of officials at high level are frequent , the exchange and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , cultural , public health , science and technology , and other spheres are expanding with each passing day , and the mutual support and coordination in the international affairs are unceasingly intensified .  
Having pretty much tried all the economic revival programs to no avail , a succession of undercurrents is appearing in Japan involving the use of " an arms buildup and expanded military industry production to stimulate an economic recovery , " attempting to shift Japan toward a model in which " arms stimulate the economy " and thus achieving the goal of " killing two birds with one stone , " that is , getting the economy to take a temporary turn for the better and also achieving the goal of becoming a great military and political power .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
7 .  Both sides confirm that they hold identical or similar views and stands on major international and regional issues at present and are willing to strengthen the two countries ' close cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations and make joint efforts toward establishing new international political and economic orders that are just and rational .  
After the crew 's safe return , however , senior US military and political officials immediately turned around and went back on their word , reversed right and wrong , produced lame arguments , and even put the blame on others ; they publicly declared that military reconnaisance operations against China are " for the purpose of ensuring our security interests and protecting the security of our allies , " " preserving world peace , " and so on .  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
Supporting the Party 's principles , guiding public opinion in the correct direction , the overall situation of serving Tibet : these are three mutual relationships coexisting in a single entity ; this is a political demand the Party makes of its organs ' newspapers , the sublime mission of those who run the newspapers .  
We must strengthen our building of leadership teams , keep our objectives firmly in mind , strengthen Party spirit , consider the situation as a whole , unite closely , fulfill promises , strive to implement the Party line , have an effective and strong ideological level , political awareness and professional capability , building a strong leadership collective capable of bearing its historical responsibility .  
Disregarding the several solemn representations of the Chinese Government and the strong objections voiced by the Japanese people of all walks of life , the Japanese Government had finally decided , on the evening of 20 April , to issue a visa to Lee Teng-hui for his visit to Japan . This visa was granted under the pretext of so-called " humanitarianism " and under the condition that the visit is limited to only medical treatment , without engaging in any political activity . 
It is reported that running in-depth education study classes are mainly aimed at meeting the needs of giving additional knowledge to former " Falungong " practitioners who have basically been reformed through persuasion , changing their mode of thinking , and exploring a law governing ideological and political work in the new age .  
However , facts have shown Hong Kong 's Falungong has a political purpose when its members exercise , it has reduced itself to the status of a political organization following Li Hongzhi 's order and targeting at the central government , and it has continued to engage in activities incompatible with the stated purpose when it registered itself as a social group .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
The list of US arms sales to Taiwan has been generally decided .  Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan held that safeguarding national security is the consistent stand of the ruling and opposition parties .  He also stressed that Taiwan must not pay attention to the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war . "  He said that obtaining weapons does not necessarily mean ensuring national defense security , and national defense security alone is not equivalent to national security and that real national security must have political support , which means stable cross-strait relations .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
After the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1958 , friendly and cooperative relations continued to develop , and bilateral cooperation achieved gratifying results in the political , economic , cultural , and public health fields .  
At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .  There is a universal call from various social circles on the Taiwan authorities to abandon the " Taiwan independence " ideology , stop political in-fighting , improve cross-strait relations , open three direct links [ postal , commercial , and air and shipping links ] , and concentrate on revitalizing the economy .  
Having sufficient weapons and equipment is merely one of the conditions for ensuring national security , and other important conditions include peaceful and stable cross-strait relations , brisk and active economic development and competitiveness , and a sound and mature democratic political system .  
Reportedly , although many proposals on adjusting China 's foreign policy have been sent to Zhongnanhai , as a leadership change at the upcoming 16th party congress is not far away , Jiang Zemin hopes to accomplish the transfer of power in a stable political environment , so the difficult policy issues will be left up to his successor .  Therefore , China will continue to maintain its existing foreign policy for the time being , and will continue to behave in a manner of " hiding its strength and biding its time " in international affairs .  
He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
As a matter of fact , that a rightwing politician like Koizumi can become the president of a ruling party and the prime minister of Japan and that an extreme rightwing politician like Shintaro Ishihara could be elected Tokyo Governor a few years ago have precisely reflected that the rightist trend is gaining momentum in Japan 's political arena .  
The procedure also stipulates that no Internet online service business sites are to be set up within 200 meters of such places as key central party , political , and military organs , within 200 meters of middle and elementary schools , and in residential buildings .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : At the present , along with the accelerating development of political multi-polarization and economic globalization , calls for democratization of international relations are running high with each passing day , while attempts to build a unipolar world have become increasingly unpopular and impossible .  
The foreign ministers stress that the international prestige of the " Shanghai Five " has been enhanced and it has become an increasingly influential positive factor in safeguarding regional and world peace , security , and stability .  It is also playing an important role in promoting the multipolarization of the world and establishing a new international political and economic order that is fair , reasonable , and democratic .  
Article 20 .  Military regions , provincial military districts ( including Beijing Garrison and other garrisons ) , military subdistricts ( including sub-garrisons ) , and the people 's armed forces departments of counties , autonomous counties , cities , and municipal districts shall conduct national defense education for militiamen and personnel on reserve duty in combination with political education , organizational rectification , military training , performance of services , conscription work , and activities on important festivals and commemoration days .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
Extensively promoting the educational campaign to study and put into practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of Party members is an important task of the military 's political work for this year , which was decided in accordance with the directive of the Central Military Commission . It also is an important measure and realistic procedure for improving the quality of Party members and strengthening Party-building throughout the military .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
Bao Tong 's " Confession " during his imprisonment in Qincheng Prison was published exactly under this awful political atmosphere , which sent me a profound feeling about the courage of that " person with high aspirations and determination " who has defied power in order to let justice prevail .  In addition , I have a feeling about the noble integrity of Bao Tong , who is " determined to leave a clean reputation in the world and has no fear for dying the most cruel death . "  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
Lai Changxing at that time relied on the network of connections he had woven over many years in key Party , government and military organs by wearing the hat of a private entrepreneur who was famous all over the country , a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference of Fujian Province and an honorary citizen of Xiamen City , among other political glories .  
China wishes to work hard together with peoples from Africa and other countries in the world , and to make new contributions to the construction of a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order , and to world peace and development .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
In addition to the ongoing economic restructuring and the changes in the external economic environment , the worsening economic situation in Taiwan was mainly caused by the turbulent political situation , the confused financial and economic policies , the uncertainty in cross-strait relations , and the shaken confidence among the people after the new government took power .  In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
Being a law that comprehensively regularizes the work of national defense education and provides the basic standards for organizing national defense education activities among the entire people , the National Defense Education Law should be seriously implemented by all state organs and armed forces , all political parties and social organizations , all enterprises and institutions , and all grass-roots mass self-management organizations .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
As a comprehensive law that regulates the work on national defense education , the " Law on National Defense Education " provides the basic rules for conducting activities related to national defense education for the whole people .  All state organs and armed forces , all political parties and social organizations , all enterprises and nonprofit institutions , and grassroots self-rule organizations of a mass nature should conscientiously implement it .  
and all departments in education , culture , propaganda , press , and publishing . "  It is stipulated in the " Law on National Defense Education " that all state organs and armed forces , all political parties and social organizations , all enterprises and nonprofit institutions , and grassroots self-rule organizations of a mass nature are obligated to conduct national defense education .  
Li Ruihuan said : The good political relationship between China and Libya has laid a solid foundation for developing economic and trade cooperation .  There is vast potential in such cooperation as their economies are highly complementary .  
After several months of diligent work , the task force uncovered the truth about rampant fraudulent claims for export tax rebates by some of the localities , units , and enterprises in the Chaoshan region .  They investigated to check if some large , key cases , and political and legal agencies followed the law in arresting criminal elements engaged in fraud .  Corrupt elements in party and political agencies and law enforcement departments with ties to criminal elements on the outside were also uncovered .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Party committees and political science and legal commissions at all levels must better guide and coordinate the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , work together to study and unify thinking on major cases and actions , and ensure the smooth and healthy progress of the strike-hard struggle .  
We must conduct a law-enforcement inspection drive while carrying out the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , make a special endeavor to resolve the pronounced problems facing the contingent of political and legal workers , resolutely purge the tiny number who have brought disgrace to the contingent , and vigorously commend and foster advanced models .  
During his " journey to establish communication , " Mr . Siew explained on many occasions that he favors adopting the model of European economic union under the current conditions of political deadlock across the Taiwan Strait to implement the concept of economic cooperation by shelving disputes and proceeding in an orderly and gradual manner and in stages in accordance with the " common market " formula .  
In the future , both sides of the strait should keep in mind regional union and national reunification , eliminate political interference from separatist forces , work to promote reciprocity and mutual benefit for both sides of the strait in economics and trade , and create a new win-win and mutually beneficial situation of cooperation and exchange .  
While cracking a number of major criminal gangs , public security organs in various places have also launched massive offensives of political propaganda to thoroughly crush the psychological defense of criminals .  The " Strike Hard " campaign has thus won another batch of victories .  
The following overall appraisals of Taiwan under the DPP " green ruling party " over the past year can be made : The political situation is chaotic , cross-strait relations continue to be tense , the economy is slipping tremendously , there is social unrest , and Taiwan not only has not " moved up , " it has instead continually " sunk downwards . "  
Political party politics is especially far from maturity - - the old system has been destroyed , but the new rules and new standards are not yet completely set up .  Even though the new system has already been established , it does not yet get its due respect and lacks authority , and the so-called " democratic system " does not exist .  Rather , the politicians lack " democratic accomplishments , " and the sudden turnover of political parties has inevitably led to violent political , economic , and social upheaval .  
In his speech , he pointed out : After the leader of the Taiwan authorities came into office , he deliberately adopted a vague and evasive position toward the issue of the one China principle , denied the " 1992 consensus , " openly stated that " reunification is not the only option " and " Taiwan is a state with independent sovereignty , " challenged the one China principle , brought cross-strait relations into an impasse , caused a chaotic political and economic situation to the island , and deeply upset the people .  
When giving a briefing about Cambodian 's domestic situation , Hun Sen said : Under the leadership of King Sihanouk , Cambodia terminated the civil war and the consequent domestic turmoil which lasted many years , realized national reconciliation , and moved onto the path of national reconstruction with the cooperation of all political parties inside the parliament .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
Li Donghai pointed out that in the past year the Taiwan authorities refusing to acknowledge the one China principle and sparing no efforts to deny the " 1992 consensus " reached by the two associations has led to a worsening and deterioration of cross-strait relations , and has also led to Taiwan being in a constant state of chaos .  The political and economic crises have worsened , the unemployment rate has unceasingly climbed upward , and complaints are heard everywhere from the majority of the public .  
However , at least before the election to be held by the end of this year , the current relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong suffers from no immediate and obvious conflict of political interests nor any unfavorable subjective and objective factors to their interactions .  Even if Lee Teng-hui vigorously reveals that the main character of the scandal of Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corporation is in fact Lien Chan , it still can not undermine the present relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong .  
Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
18 percent felt that fierce political fighting led to weakening economic competitiveness ; 15 percent attributed it to the authorities ' ideological command and inability to take proper steps ; and 6 percent felt that people have not put in sufficient efforts .  
The basis for the economic expert 's judgment is that the principal administrator is formulating policies on " political correctness . "  As a result , professional bureaucrats have lost their functions , the capable people have remained silent , and those who curry favor with the authorities for personal gain have followed the direction where the wind blows , thus resulting in corrupt political practice .  
A series of erroneous policies , such as the sudden announcements on the termination , and then the resumption of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant and the use of large sums from the " national stabilization fund " to support the stock market in order to fulfill political promises , have wasted energy , resulting in the loss of hope for Taiwan in the next decade .  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .  However , they spontaneously stressed the crucial role of developing cross-strait relations .  Some scholars pointed out that the authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has led people to lose hope .  
Jeb , who had attempted to ignore rumors about him in the public , was finally unable to hold himself back and declared that he was absolutely loyal to his wife and they had helped each other even when they were in humble circumstances for 27 years and that the sex scandal about him and Henderson was " a terrible lie , " which might have been used to serve political purposes .  
The European Parliament highly values the correct position adopted by China in the Asian financial crisis a few years ago , and is glad to see that China has made great achievements in its socialist modernization and in maintaining social stability , and enabling its people to live and work happily and peacefully .  It is willing to make joint efforts with the Chinese side in strengthening cooperation in the political , economic , trade , and financial fields , and make greater efforts to advance the comprehensive development of European-Chinese relations .  
In order to ensure the smooth enforcement of the government and military orders in a special natural , political , and social environment in Tibet , the Tibet Military District CPC Committee spelled out the following requirement in no uncertain terms : " Though there is a forbidden zone for life on the roof of the world , there is no special zone for enforcing the government and military orders here , " thus enhancing a sense of " unconditional submission " among the officers and men .  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy . "  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
During an interview by the press , Tang Yinlong said the Dalai is not just a religious figure , but also the general representative of the serf system in Tibet and a political refugee in the garb of religion who , over a long time , has engaged himself abroad in criminal activities of trying to split up the country and undermining unity among ethnic groups .  
As a matter of fact , in analyzing the major cause to the chaotic political situation in Taiwan , the public opinion and some political and academic figures on the island pointed out in the same way without prior consultation : First , in the past year since the leader of the Taiwan authorities took office , he has not taken actual measures to relax and improve cross-strait relations and to dispel the people 's misgiving about his seeking " Taiwan independence " and this has caused the Taiwan society to have an unstable external environment .  
In accordance with the UN charter and the acknowledged basic norms of international law , they should step up consultation , coordination , and cooperation , correctly handle the major political , security , and economic problems facing the international community , show proper concern for the interests and demands of the developing countries , and turn the AMEM into a major force in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order .  
While intensifying the aversion of most countries in the world to varying degrees , the so-called " unilateralism , " which is criticized by many countries , has also prompted many people of insight in the world to begin pondering numerous profound and lasting historical philosophic , political , and cultural issues , such as that in the new century , how different countries , different systems , and different cultures should make use of each other 's strong points for reference and respect each other ;  
Third , as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the biggest developing country in the world , China has persistently pursued an independent and good-neighborly foreign policy , advocated engaging all-directional dialogues with all regions of the world , including Europe , and promoted the establishment of a fairer and more rational international political and economic new order .  
To put it another way , we believe that like the natural world , the world of mankind is rich and colorful in nature , and the layout of world political and economic systems and order [ based on ] legal principles of international relations must fit and promote the realization of this diversity .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another . 
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .  Both the ruling and the opposition parties have been trying their utmost to break through an encirclement at the year-end legislative elections .  
During the visit , NPC Chairman Li Peng exchanged views with leaders of the national assemblies , governments , and political parties in the three countries on strengthening bilateral relations in the new century and on the current international and regional situations .  The visit has attained the aim of enhancing friendship , expanding consensus , and strengthening cooperation .  
The two countries have seen rapid development in exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields since they established diplomatic relations more than eight years ago .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
Leaders and political institutions at all levels should , in accordance with the criteria , select promising soldiers with outstanding moral and military integrity and excellent and crucial soldiers , heroic models and exemplary figures in preparing for war , performing their duty and carrying out significant tasks , so as to allow this policy to be an award and a guide in further arousing enthusiasm in loving the military and learning military skills among the majority of soldiers .  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
This essential character requires that military personnel of the new type should not only become military experts , but also be politically minded , politically sensitive , highly capable of making distinctions on political issues , firm in adhering to ideals and convictions , and pure ideologically and morally .  
During the initial days of reform , due to the heavy shackles of the " Left " thinking , reform met with strong obstruction .  In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
The US strategic adjustment is a new round of expansion under the conditions of the development of the political , economic , and military situation in the world and the necessary result of further consolidating the US position of being the sole superpower in the new century .  The defense group of the Bush administration has a strong color of " Cold War fighter " .  The essence of his " new pragmatism " is to use the strong power of the United States as basis to maximize its national interests .  
President Akayev said cheerfully that the fact that the fruitful activities of the " Shanghai Five " in recent years have drawn the attention of the international community has a lot to do with its growing international prestige in the region and in the world , with our successful solution of problems in the political , military , economic , trade and other spheres , and with the tremendous role we are playing in the protection of regional security .  
After the invasion of terrorists into southern Kyrgyzstan last year , it was a member of the " Shanghai Five " that first provided political , military and technical assistance to the country .  The collective security system of the Commonwealth of Independent States also played a positive part .  At present , the armed forces of Kyrgyzstan are bracing themselves for possible assaults from international terrorist forces .  
All military forces profoundly carried out and implemented the important strategy of administering the military according to the law , through which they have further raised their level of making decisions , administering the military , managing military training and managing soldiers all according to the law and have effectively accelerated ideological and political construction and the comprehensive construction of the military .  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
The tasks undertaken by the Bureau of Investigation and Analysis which has more than 7,000 staff and more than 70 intelligence stations all over the world are the most mysterious .  In simple terms , it is targeted against neighboring countries and major countries and through means like espionage and reconnaissance to collect and sort out the political , military , and economic intelligence of these countries and provide the most updated research and analysis results to the Government Cabinet of India . Meanwhile , it also possesses certain rebellion-instigating , subversive , and anti-espionage functions .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
Only by establishing a fair and reasonable international political , economic , and security new order and establishing a new security outlook based on mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , and cooperation can the world 's long-lasting peace and development be maintained and promoted .  
The municipal party committee explicitly requires : All major affairs in the capital city 's political , economic , cultural , and social life must be submitted to the Political Consultation Conference for deliberation .  In particular , before decisions are made on major projects and policies , before the change of administrative division of districts in the municipality , and before the formulation of local laws and regulations , political consultation must be conducted .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
They should continue to carry forward democracy and play a positive and active role in advancing the building of democratic politics in the capital , actively assist the party committee and the government in coordinating relations of all sides and resolving contradictions , thus safeguarding the social and political stability of the national capital .  
But what Taiwan lacks is not this factor .  Taiwan 's multi-party system and the very lacking and fantastically complex political-economic system including the spiritual state of her social , economic , political fronts , are the results of a relatively developed economy rather than relative backsliding .  
Recognizing this point , the contradictory standoff between social groups and government by political parties has lost the overriding standard of evaluation and criterion for constraint , has become muddled , and everything is like shifting sands and drifting clouds , completely without a common direction .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
Political reform not only has been affecting and constraining progress of the economic reform , but also has been affecting and constraining substantive progress in building democracy and the rule of law , as well as affecting and constraining the building of an effective power supervision and constraining mechanism needed to step up anti-corruption efforts , and affecting and constraining the maintenance and development of social stability and realization of long-term peace and stability .  Therefore , the task of reform of China 's political system is heavy and the way ahead is long .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the important " three represents " ideology advanced by Comrade Jiang Zemin has answered from a political , economic , and cultural point of view the basic questions of what type of party to build and how to build it .  It has given expression to a distinctly advanced characteristic , a scientifically innovative spirit , a broad , global view , and a staunch purpose for party building .  
Since the National Social Security Work Conference , Luo Gan pointed out , the party committee , government , and political and law departments at all levels have seriously implemented the spirit of the conference and swiftly launched the " strike hard " struggle focused on " attacking triads and eliminating crime " .  They have followed the law in severely and promptly cracking down on serious criminal offenders , started a high tide of the " strike hard " struggle , and scored initial successes .  
It is necessary to check the implementation of the spirit of the central directives and National Social Order Work Conference , examine whether the localities have dealt with the critical points in line with local reality , and review the effects of the " strike hard " struggle .  They should also inspect the cases jointly handled by the central political and law departments and localities , the crackdown on triads , the removal of the " protective umbrella " granted to the triad forces , as well as the difficulties and obstacles encountered in attacking triads .  
Jiang Zemin said that the sound political relations between China and Niger provide an effective safeguard for the development of bilateral economic cooperation and trade , noting that the two countries have carried out fruitful cooperation in the economic and trade fields and enterprises of both countries have made positive headway in mutually beneficial cooperation under the principles of sincerity , equality and mutual benefit . 
In recent years , your distinguished government has devoted itself to maintaining domestic political stability , vitalizing the national economy and promoting social progress , and has achieved positive results .  
China is willing to improve its communication and coordination with all nations , especially the vast number of developing countries , so as to push forward the development of world multipolarization and eliminate the imbalance and injustice brought by economic globalization , and to make unremitting efforts for building a fair , rational , and new international political and economic order as well as peace and progress that the people of all nations can enjoy .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
Since the sum of the gross national product of the APEC members account for half of the world 's total , he said , a strong voice issued by such an economic forum will serve as a political impetus for the launching of a new round of talks .  It will also have a direct and profound influence on the ongoing preparation work in Geneva .  
The social , economic , political , and military moves of any side will affect the reunification of China . The Democratic Progressive Party and Chen Shui-bian authorities are launching the " Taiwan independence " activities and are selling out Taiwan 's interest in collusion with the anti-China forces in the United States and Japan at the cost of making the people on both sides discouraged and disappointed at the peaceful reunification and afraid of the future . 
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
It critically incorporated British and French utopian socialism 's theory on fairness and justice in human society , the rational cores of dialectics of Germany 's classical philosophy and materialism , British classical political economy 's method for dissecting the capitalist economy , and intellectual pith in the latest achievements of natural sciences .  
In the field of the military strategy , with regard to the United States ' national missile defense plan which was widely criticized , this representative figure of the conservatives in the US political circles said that Washington was not subject to the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed with the former Soviet Union . He also " guaranteed " that the legislation for the deployment of the NMD system would be completed as soon as possible .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
Governments at all levels and various government departments should make the basic interests of the masses of people the starting point of all work and take effective measures to solve difficult problems of universal concern to the masses of people .  At present , we should do the following three tasks well : first , it is necessary to effectively strengthen public security work and to go all out to safeguard social and political stability .  
It is necessary to deeply study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , conduct more intensive education on the correct world and life outlook and correct values among law enforcement and police officers and judicial personnel , and make greater effort to build a high-quality law enforcement contingent with firm political stand , profession proficiency , good work style , and noble moral standards of being honest and uncorrupt  
Answer : A host of facts has proved that Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult organization have completely transformed into an out-and-out reactionary political organization and a political force and have become the tool of international anti-China forces and the splittist forces in Taiwan for subverting the political power of our people 's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system and for undermining national unification .  
The vigorous development of the CPC 's international liaison work was of great significance in new China 's efforts to break through the political isolation and economic blockade imposed by the Western countries , and in consolidating its newfound political power .  At that time , it also impacted on the peace and national liberation movements throughout the world .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
After that , the leaders of the five countries held regular annual meetings , and the contents of the meetings were extended from strengthening mutual trust in the border areas to across-the-board mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , security , diplomatic , economic , and trade fields among the five countries .  
Speaking at a recent symposium on financial and economic affairs , Central Bank Vice Governor Chen Shih-meng mentioned that , at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting he attended , many foreign businessmen maintained that they believed the Chinese Mainland would become the biggest market in the future , but that , owing to political and cultural factors , they had problems gaining direct access .  
The strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has continued to deepen in the new century .  This not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples but also conducive to promoting the process of a multi-polar world and to building a new , just , and rational international political and economic order .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
However , no other political organization had so many progressive elements as our party gathered , and was organized so tightly as our party , and made so great sacrifices for the Chinese nation , and could maintain so close ties with the people .  The party formed and maintained its correct theory and line as it was good at summing up experience in the course of advancing .  
Pay attention to intensifying the effort to analyze Western currents of political and cultural thinking , so as to reveal their reactionary nature , to make clear their decadent and harmful character , to enhance the sense of concern and the capacity to resist corruption and change , and to control armed forces ideologically and politically .  
While progressive thinking and advanced ideas are being formed and developed , various decadent ideas and cultural elements have also been taking this opportunity to achieve infiltration , with idealism , pseudo-science , and anti-Marxist currents of political thinking raising their heads and once-eradicated ugly social phenomena appearing to be resurrected ; the corrosive effects and influence on officials ' and soldiers ' minds should not be underestimated .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
In carrying out ideological and political education , the military must adhere to the main melody , vigorously advocate patriotism , collectivism , and the spirit of sacrifice , adhere to the purpose of serving the people whole-heartedly , adhere to principles of materialism , resolutely fight against idealism and feudal superstitions as well as decadent bourgeois lifestyles and various erroneous currents of thought and phenomena .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
On the sound basis of political mutual trust , China attaches importance to developing economic cooperation with neighboring countries and has actively uplifted economic cooperation to a higher level .  
The " Shanghai spirit " cultivated by the Shanghai Five process of mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , consultation , respect for cultural pluralism , and seeking common development , is a summary of the experiences of the five countries in handling mutual relations ; in addition , it is of important practical significance in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order of justice and reason .  
He spoke highly of the important role of the corps in production , construction , consolidating frontier defense , maintaining stability , and promoting ethnic solidarity , and encouraged its members to keep firmly in mind the heavy tasks entrusted them by the party and the people , further increase their sense of the historical mission and political responsibility of defending the border area and doing farm work there , and give full play to their role of a mainstay in promoting Xinjiang 's economic and social development and maintaining Xinjiang 's stability .  
The Common Program solemnly announced the abolition of the feudal system , which had shackled women .  Women were to enjoy the same political , economic , cultural , educational , and other social rights as men .  It cut the four ropes that had bound Chinese women , namely , the political system , clan power , religious authority , and the authority of their husbands , and ushered in a new era in the liberation of Chinese women . "  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .  The HKSAR Government must assume responsibility for the security and stability of Hong Kong . Hence , the government 's stance and methods are totally reasonable and necessary .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The sovereignty of each newly independent country , even the political stability of the whole region , are threatened by the continuous illegal Chechnya military terrorist acts , the long-lasting Afghan war , the influence of Islamic fundamentalism and the chaotic drug and arms smuggling .  The furious terrorism , separatism and extremism especially endanger the region .  
Taking advantage of the complex social factors and the transnational geological condition in the Feiergan valley , international terrorist forces repeatedly carried out terrorist activities in Kyrgyzstan and south Uzbekistan in 1999 and 2000 .  In addition , due to the various political effects from both inside and outside the region , relevant countries and the whole Eurasian area face unprecedented threats to stability .  
During his 12 years in power , Lee Teng-hui played political trickery to the utmost , excluded those not agreeing with him , was tyrannical and domineering , and , mechanically copying the Western parliamentary democracy model , directed several " constitutional amendments " and elections , prompting Taiwan to become a place " filled with a sense of confrontation and hatred " and distorting all mechanisms of a modern democratic society .  
The statement read : " This newspaper will learn a profound lesson from this incident and take effective measures to adopt correct guiding principles for newspaper management , thoroughly implement the principle of ' newspaper management based on political considerations , ' and improve newspaper management by adhering to the policy of fostering unity and stability , serving as an inspirational force , and stressing positive propaganda and by correctly shaping public opinion .  We will do our best to give wide publicity to reform , opening up , and socialist modernization . "  
The third generation of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has shown great foresight , managed the overall situation , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , continued to deepen reform and expanded opening up , vigorously advanced the building of the socialist market economy system , surmounted difficulties , overcome all kinds of risks from political and economic fields as well as from nature , and succeeded in realizing a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and safeguarding social and political stability .  
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
Since this is the first year of the Tenth Five-year Plan and a crucial moment in China 's forthcoming WTO entry , assessments of this year 's implementation of the Tenth Five-year Plan and the international and domestic political , economic , and social environments in the first half of the year will be made at the Beidaihe meeting .  
The two governments agreed to develop bilateral relations of friendly cooperation on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-intervention in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  They also agreed that while maintaining good political relations , efforts would be made to actively open up exchanges and cooperation in other fields , especially in economy and trade .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .  
the disparities related to major political principles must be criticized and corrected in an unambiguous way , and political guidance should be given to achieve new unity on the new basis .  Thus , the united front may always maintain a relaxed , stable , united , and harmonious political environment inside .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , under the guidance of the party three-generation leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core and , through the unremitting hard work of all party members and the people of all nationalities across the country , who have united as one in their struggle , tremendous changes of historic significance have taken place in the economic , political , cultural , and social features of China .  
Chen noted : Taiwan is currently in an economic recession , suffering from declining industries and a rising unemployment rate , and this has caused pains to the people .  Truly , Taiwan is faced , it can be said , with " a myriad of political issues and countless pressing problems . "  
The fourth is the tradition of deep affection for the motherland and hometown .  They constantly show concern for the economic , political , and social development of the motherland , as well as the living conditions of their beloved ones , consider it as an honor to be able to make contributions to their fellow countrymen , and take pride in the magnificent and long-standing history and culture of their nation .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
According to Cheng Yun-peng , director of the publicity department of the DPP , who accompanied him to visit Lee , the atmosphere of the talks was relaxed and harmonious .  They talked about the political and economic situation in Taiwan . In addition , since the host and the guest share the same background of having studied in Japan , they also exchanged views on Japan 's current situations and Taiwan-Japan relations .  
The statement says that " in the past year , Lee Teng-hui has retired , but has continued to frequently make use of provincial sentiments to create ideological confrontation to satisfy his personal political desires in his attempt to bring about a complete split of the country .  This really has made us Chinese abroad feel angry . "  
Referring to rumors , such as the narrow candidate choice for Li 's political group , difficulties in raising campaign funds and objection from Madame Li Teng-hui , a key person involved in the political group 's policy-making emphasized that these are a series of mudslinging tricks played by ambitious people intentionally .  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
We should understand the political value of the important thinking of the " three represents , " not only in light of the international environment faced by our country but also in light of the domestic tasks to be completed , particularly social issues .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
He said that in recent years the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries of China and Cuba have developed rapidly , there has been mutual understanding and support in the political field , economic cooperation has unceasingly expanded , various exchanges have increased day by day , and there is close cooperation in the midst of international struggle .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
Why has our Party been able to have become eminent among various political forces in modern Chinese society , turned from small to big and from weak to strong , developed from only more than 50 people at the very beginning to the biggest ruling party in the world with more than 64-million Party members , and achieved these brilliant achievements ? 
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
China must be led by a progressive political party armed with advanced ideology and only thus can national liberation and regeneration be realized .  This is the conclusion drawn from the modern history of China .  
We have actively advocated and safeguarded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics with the strong domineering over the weak .  We have upheld principle and justice , striving to let justice prevail and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the vast developing countries , and pushed the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
The purpose of the new democratic revolution led by our party was to abrogate the imperialist privileges in China , eliminate exploitation and oppression by the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class , change the comprador feudal production relations and the rotten political superstructure built on such an economic base , establish a new political superstructure with the people 's democratic dictatorship as the core and fundamentally emancipate the fettered productive forces .  
Over the past 20-plus years , we have conducted bold explorations and practices and pushed forward the reforms in economic and political structures and other areas and greatly emancipated and developed China 's social productive forces , thereby bringing about tremendous changes in national economic development and social progress .  
To always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party must , in all kinds of work including party 's theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and ultimate goal , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
Our party should always represent the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  Our party must , in all kinds of work including party theory , line , program , principle and policy , persevere in taking in the fundamental interests of the people as the starting point and purpose , bring into full play people 's enthusiasm , initiative and creativity , and enable the people to constantly obtain tangible economic , political and cultural benefits through continuous social development and progress .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of the personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
With the development of reform , opening up , and modernization , the Chinese working class has expanded steadily .  The quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of their political awareness , moral standards , scientific and technical and educational level .  It has become more progressive .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of cadres who are more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and more competent professionally and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber officials who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
and the party 's leading collective of the third generation has the extraordinary political wisdom and the superb capability to keep a complicated situation under control , and is a firm leading collective that leads the whole party and the people of the entire country to constantly push forward the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Through development of more than 50 years , especially in the development of reform and opening up during the past two decades , China has established important ideological and political foundation and possessed a material , technological and human resource foundation for achieving the main modernization by the middle of this century .  
and was an out and out dictator .  He blindly followed western parliamentary and democratic elections in disregard of specific conditions , which caused endless wrangles among parties and factions , continuous upheaval in the political situation , and serious economic losses .  
Everyone held that upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces is a great creation of our party and a political strong point unique to our armed forces , and is also the fundamental guarantee for our armed forces always being in an invincible position .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
toppled the three big mountains [ imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucrat-capitalism ] , built new China , and ended the tragic fate where our country was like a sheet of loose sand [ in a state of disunity ] , was rent by disunity , and allowed itself to be trampled upon .  We underwent socialist construction , broke blockades , consolidated our political power , achieved self-reliance , fought hard , and fought against heaven and earth in the Daqing oilfield .  
given a concentrated expression to the latest achievements in theoretical innovation that have been attained by the party 's leading collective of the third generation ; and is therefore an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory on political parties .  The important thinking of " three represents " has pointed out the direction for our efforts to push forward the great project of strengthening party building under the present new historical conditions and to subsequently attain constant new victories in the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
For the first time , it gives a systematical reply to a series of basic questions concerning the development course of socialism , development stage of socialism , fundamental tasks of socialism , development driving forces , external conditions , political guarantees , strategic steps , the party 's leadership , the reliable forces , and the motherland 's reunification in China . It guides our party to formulate its basic line in the initial stage of socialism .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
They are all determined to , under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , deeply implement the principles and policies of the central leadership for the Taiwan issue , keep a strong sense of political responsibility , work hard to break new ground and make solid progress , unite compatriots on both sides of the straits and overseas compatriots to fight against all separatist attempts , and make contributions to the accomplishment of the motherland 's reunification at an earlier date .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin mentioned that it is necessary to uphold and perfect the system of people 's congress , the multiparty cooperation system under the leadership of the communist party , and the system of political consultation and regional national autonomy , actively , safely , and steadily push forward the reform of political structure , further expand the democracy of socialism , govern the country according to law , and build a socialist country ruled by law .  
According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .  By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
In and after the 1980 ' s , our party also began to establish friendly relations with leftist , centralist , and right-wing political parties and their international organizations in the Western countries by transcending ideological differences and the disparity of social systems with the spirit of seeking understanding , dialogue , and cooperation .  
and it was a programmatic document guiding us in the new millennium to comprehensively promote the party 's construction of grand new projects , and to comprehensively promote the grand cause of the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The troops throughout the entire military must thoroughly understand the vital significance of General Secretary Jiang 's speech , make studying and implementing the speech a significant political mission and a long term strategic mission , and lose no time in firmly grasping these missions .  
The session reached a comprehensive consensus on the 12 questions left over from the multilateral talks , including agricultural and industrial subsidies , trade rights , a transitional review mechanism on China , and other important issues , Long Yongtu said , adding that the political and substantial questions related to China 's accession to the WTO have been resolved . 
The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .  
Over the past year since political power changed hands , however , it is most regrettable to find that the SEF has been totally frozen out , and the public can no longer see the scenes of Director Koo Chen-fu , surrounded by reporters , narrating his optimistic views on the future prospects of cross-strait relations in a mild yet firm tone . 
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina Patricio Echegaray , and the Party 's Secretary for International Relations Athos Fava , said in a congratulatory telegram to Jiang Zemin , " The Chinese Communist Party , established 80 years ago by a small number of revolutionaries in the historically famous city of Shanghai , proposed the objective of seizing political power and establishing socialist society .  It seized power within the relatively short span of 28 years .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
However , some of the outstanding problems in the Party , especially problems among leading cadres with regard to Party spirit and conduct , were not solved .  A considerable number of leading cadres still fail to meet or completely meet the requirements in carrying out their tasks and keep pace with the current situation in the ideological and political realm .  
Western countries such as the United States have set a bad precedent in international law by playing with double political and legal standards and pushing into the dock the leaders of countries whom they regard as a nail in the eye , and this is bound to be condemned by the international community .  
The circular points out : Party committees and political organs at all levels should include the work of giving help to poor areas in their work agenda , make well-coordinated and careful arrangements , formulate concrete plans and work measures , and be strict to enhance the comprehensive efficiency in the work of poverty relief and development according to the specific conditions of the local areas where the troops are stationed . 
We should comprehensively implement the principle on promoting younger , better educated , more professionally competent , and revolutionary cadres and the criterion on both ability and political integrity , exercise strict education and management on party member-cadres , pay keen attention to recruiting new party members from among outstanding young and middle-aged students and teachers , further strengthen the cohesive power and creativity of party organizations of schools of higher learning , and provide strong and effective political guarantee for reform , development , and stability of the cause of higher education .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
Second , we must throw ourselves into red-hot revolution and construct reality , research the actual major questions of the Party , the government and the masses , and provide an accurate direction for public opinion and support for spiritual intelligence for the great leap forward in Tibetan development and long-term political stability .  This is the glorious and important responsibility of workers in the social sciences .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
But contrary to his expectations , the " green " regime got off to a rough start , the chaotic political and economic situation has worsened on the island , the stalemate in the cross-strait relations continues , and the popular anger boils over .  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
The provincial military district system , in accordance with relevant regulations at a national level and in the military , integrate political education , organization and rectification , military training , recruitment work , and major holiday and commemoration activities , accomplishing national defense of civilian militia reserves .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
Since the first visit by President Yeltsin to China in December 1992 , the cooperation between the two countries in all fields rapidly developed and the exchanges between the two countries in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural and other fields became increasingly frequent and close .  According to statistics , in 1993 the number of visits between delegations of the two countries above the vice ministerial level reached 25 ; and in 1994 it reached 36 .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
Mutual political trust between the two sides has been further strengthened , trade and economic , science and technology cooperation have been gradually expanded , exchanges between local governments and non-government contacts have been constantly developed , and outstanding results have been obtained in cooperation in international affairs .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
The " Sino-Russian Good-Neighborly Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation , " signed by the heads of state of China and Russia , has laid down the principle and direction for the two countries to carry out cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and humanity fields , as well as in the international arena .  As a programmatic document for guiding development of Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century , the treaty is bound to raise relations between the two countries to a higher level .  
With the direct concern shown and efforts made by the heads of state of the two countries , exchange of high-level visits between China and Russia has been frequent , and the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , science and technological , cultural , educational , and other fields has continued to develop , and the results have been notable .  
The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
Second , with regard to the principle of noninterference in internal affairs , the treaty advocates transcending ideology and not interfering in the choice of the other party 's road for political , economic , social , and cultural development adopted in light of its national conditions .  
The communique says , the two leaders affirm that their stances on a whole series of major international issues are identical or similar ; both advocate strengthening their coordination and close cooperation within the framework of the United Nations and other international organizations , and will make joint efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
We are willing to continue to strengthen cooperation in the international arena and make joint efforts to promote the establishment of a democratic , fair and rational new international political and economic order and to create a new world of lasting peace and universal prosperity .  
Lukashenko said Belarus and China take the same stand on major international issues , including the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order .  Both sides call for adhering to the principles of sovereignty , equality , territorial integrity , noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries , and other basic principles governing international relations .  Both sides also persistently safeguard the security structure and stability of the world today and are opposed to undermining the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty . "  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
Over the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , relations of bilateral cooperation have developed smoothly .  There have been frequent mutual visits at a high level and the two sides have established a basic framework and principle for cooperation in political , economic , trade , cultural and other fields .  
You have always maintained the true political qualities of being loyal to the party , to the country , to the people and to socialism .  You have resolutely waged struggles against western hostile forces and the national splittists , won great victories in suppressing rebels and bandits and in the self-defense counterattack , forcefully maintained border and social stability in Tibet , and defended our state sovereignty , territorial integrity and national unity .  
11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .  
Since China and Ukraine established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , educational , cultural , sports , and other fields between our two countries have continued to broaden , and encouraging results have been achieved .  
Both sides are continuously expanding and deepening cooperation and exchange in the political , economic and trade , scientific and technological , educational , cultural fields , and maintain the fine tradition of positive consultation and close cooperation in international affairs .  Satisfactory results have been achieved .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
Fu Quanyou called for the leading cadres in the General Staff Headquarters to take the lead in improving the style of exercising leadership , voluntarily subject themselves to the supervision of the party organizations and the masses , enable themselves to withstand political tests and resist economic temptations , adhere to the principles in wielding their powers , maintain their moral integrity , and build up a good image of being faithful to their duties , working diligently in a down-to-earth manner , and being honest and incorruptible .  
Through the propaganda , we have been greatly touched and enhanced our thinking .  Chi Haotian said that through the propaganda campaign , the reporters have shown a high degree of revolutionary dedication and a strong sense of political responsibility .  With valuable professional dedication and despite difficulties and obstacles , these reporters went deep to frontier companies and forward posts , boldly faced hardships , worked indomitably , covered a lot of outstanding , brilliant , and touching news reports , and did a good job in performing their sacred missions and lofty duties .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
At present , the international situation is complex and dynamic , our reform and construction are at a crucial moment of development and our Party 's self-construction is in a new stage of development .  Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " will greatly accelerate theory innovation , system innovation and scientific and technological innovation in our Party and our country .  The PLA is an important force to embody the Party 's and the national political advantages .  
We have a system to establish political commissioners and political institutions .  We also have a system to base Party branches on the military units at the company level .  The availability of and the adherence to these systems enables our military to ensure the military remains under the Party 's firm control despite the dynamic historical conditions and constant changes in members of the military .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
Reform is being carried out under the complicated environment at home and abroad .  It is faced with the interference and sabotage of the hostile forces .  This demands that we further enhance our political awareness , adopt a firm and clear-cut stand in our major political struggles , and resolutely safeguard the Party 's leadership and the socialist system .  
It also has a bearing on the rise or fall of the Chinese nation .  It will also determine whether or not our army can always become the effective tool to fulfill the Party 's political tasks under the new situation .  Therefore , to continuously arm our army with military equipment of advanced technology , enhance our army 's fighting power , and fulfill the Party 's highest political requirements in " fighting to win " should be our army 's basic task in upholding the Party 's absolute leadership over the army under the new situation .  
Through study , further improve the capability for observing and handling issues from a political perspective , achieve a profound understanding of the spirit of advancing with the passage of time , work hard to adapt to the profound changes in the party ' s tasks and ruling environment , and change outdated ideas , practices , and working mechanisms .  
As a powerful ideological weapon and tremendous spiritual motivation for army building , the " three represents " constitute a reliable guarantee of the army 's always keeping a firm and correct political orientation .  
make great efforts to build a contingent of high-caliber cadres in accordance with the guiding principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and the principle of attaching equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity ;  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech comprehensively , systematically , and incisively revealed the scientific implications of the " three represents " thinking .  On the basis of comprehensively summarizing the historical experience in party building over the last 80 years , he profoundly analyzed the social , economic , and political changes which have taken place since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program .  He also briefly defined the party 's nature , aim , and missions anew , showing us clearly the way forward .  
Since the peaceful liberation 50 years ago , Tibet has witnessed profound social changes , including the democratic reform as well as reform and opening up , and has scored world-renowned successes in its political , economic , and cultural development .  
We should learn from them their true political qualities of carrying forward and developing the glorious traditions of our party and our army , consciously resisting temptations , firmly holding the defense line , and always " resisting and keeping away from corrosive influences . "  We should learn from them their up-to-the-mark work style of running the inspection post strictly , ensuring a strict enforcement of the law , stressing on decorum , and observing discipline .  
Wang Lequan said that due to the daily convolution of the international situation , as we entered the 1990s , the international Islamic fundamentalist forces began to rear their ugly face , and they ran rampant in their activities .  Under the influence of international forces , within our borders , minority separatists and religious radicals harboring political schemes have been incited and encouraged , and they have created a definite unfavorable influence on Xinjiang 's social and political stability .  However , Xinjiang correctly implemented national minority and religious policies ;  
in terms of new development , the important concept of " three represents " has enriched and developed the Marxist theory of political parties , classes , and the masses according to the fundamental tenets of Marxism on the relationship between the productive forces and production and between the economic base and the superstructure , by keeping the new century in mind , and by proceeding from the laws of social development and the basic nature of the party ;  
An official of US Defense Department who asked not to be named said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish with Russia complete , normal , and friendly relations in the economic , political , military , and other fields , as a solid foundation for security and stability , and that , in this process , the two countries will simultaneously recede from the " ABM Treaty . "  
Zhao Leji , a native of Qinghai , has made himself conspicuous within a very short period of time in recent years , and is now the youngest governor in the country .  He is considered to enjoy a promising political future , and there is wide speculation that he will become one of state leaders of the new generation .  
An unidentified official of the US Defense Department said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish all-round normal and friendly relations in the economic , political , and military fields with Russia as a solid foundation for security and stability , and hoped that both sides would agree to withdraw from the ABM Treaty at the same time .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
The " Ordinance " points out : Command automation work is a large systems engineering project that organically amalgamates diverse professional work , has extremely complex lateral links , vertically threads together various levels of command , and involves all fields of army building .  To do this job well is the common responsibility of relevant professional departments of commanding , political , logistics , and armament organs at all levels .  
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
It is just like what has transpired in the past - - when all previous Japanese prime ministers and political heavyweights visited the Yasukuni Shrine , the feelings of the people from every victimized country in Asia were hurt , and the alarm bell was sounded alerting to the resurgence of militarism .  This has led to tense relations between Japan and its neighboring countries , and has also caused Japan 's international image to be coarsened even more .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
Nevertheless , how can such a country - - a country that has yet to liquidate its aggressive history and make official apologies and compensations to the aggression-inflicted countries and whose political leaders , including the prime minister , have from time to time tried to " call back the dead souls " of its militarists , denied or beautified its aggression , and continued to hurt the feeling of the countries and peoples concerned - - be qualified to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council ?  
According to information , the Chinese Foreign Ministry explicitly stated in its reply to the Japanese Foreign Ministry that in deliberately paying respects to the Yasukuni Shrine which enshrines the tablets of 14 class-A war criminals of World War II , Prime Minister Koizumi has damaged the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian countries that fell victim , and this is bound to affect the healthy development of Sino-Japanese relations .  
The Jinan Military Region especially held a training class for retiring political commissars at rest homes and some retired veteran cadres in order to have sufficient backbone instructors to guide the study by veteran cadres of the entire military region .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that speeding up the perfection of the social security system is the urgent requirement of preserving social stability and consolidating and developing the current good development momentum , and is also a strategic move for achieving lasting political stability .  
To align the personal quality of these professional soldiers with the requirements of the rank of nomcom as soon as possible , people who have obtained the rank of noncom must understand their position and role in military construction , be aware of their duties and have a strong sense of urgency regarding learning information about organization , training , and education and about administrating soldiers , so as to improve their overall quality in the military and in political fields .  
Behind the moves of Japanese political figures ' homage visits to Yasukuni Shrine are the deeply entrenched rightwing mentality in post-war Japan , radical and narrow-minded nationalist feelings , and the sustained economic depression , which has accelerated the right deviationist thinking in the Japanese society .  
As Bush said that he regarded China as a " strategic competitor " during his election campaign , Henry Kissinger pointed out : Bush 's viewpoint is just an " immature expression aimed at pleasing the conservatives and the hard-liners in the Republican Party . " A noticeable fact is that inside US political circles , there exists a hawkish camp and a dovish camp , and the influence of the two camps may change along with the changes in the domestic politics .  
Qian Qichen said in his speech , international nongovernmental organizations have developed very rapidly in recent years ; they have played an increasingly important role in international political , economic , military , cultural , and social fields , and have become a force that can not be neglected in the international arena .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
Together with Political Commissar Liu Shaoqi and other comrades , he reorganized the troops , summed up experience and lessons , strengthened party leadership and ideological and political building among the troops , and thus turned the New Fourth Army into an invincible anti-Japanese army fighting north and south of the Chang Jiang and striking terror into the enemy troops .  
Party committees , governments , and political and legal organs at various levels must have a better understanding , firmly implement the spirit of the national conference on public order work , overcome the mood of relaxation and struggle-weariness , further buttress confidence , and be determined to carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order unremittingly through to the end .  We must further highlight the key areas of struggle ;  
For example , the health of Tang Yao-ming has become a political issue because of his position .  When the media learned that he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder , they sought confirmation from the military before reporting on it .  However , the military broke the news first by publishing Tang Yao-ming 's surgery on Ching-Nien Jih-Pao . Thus , the media were unable to break the news .  This struck a great fear into journalism and the media can no longer trust the directive to " confirm all matters through the spokesman . "  
Guidance should be given to retired cadres as to broadening their horizons , updating their concepts , acquiring a profound understanding of the major theoretical and practical significance of the " speech , " maintaining political staunchness , frequently renewing their thinking , keeping up with the times , and always preserving the nature of CPC members .  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
Non-public-run economic organizations , social bodies , and civilian-run non-enterprise units are emerging in large numbers , and are producing a major influence on the economic , cultural , and social development of our country .  To guide these economic and social bodies to attain a healthy development , we need to have correct principles and policies as well as a perfect legal system , and we also need to strengthen the party 's political leadership .  
Through this window , people can feel that China , a country with a stable political environment , with an increasingly developed economy , with ethnic unity , with social progress and with increasingly greater overall national strength , stands in the East and is a major credit to maintaining global peace and development .  
He praised the overseas Chinese in the United States for ceaselessly working to strengthen themselves , uniting in endeavor , engaging in arduous pioneering , and not only fusing into mainstream society but also enhancing their economic and political status .  At the same time he saluted the overseas Chinese for actively taking part in building the motherland , supporting the motherland 's cause of peaceful reunification , and promoting the positive development of Sino-US relations .  
4 .  The two sides agreed that the two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , public health , and scientific and technological fields had brought tangible benefits to both countries and their people .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
we must comprehensively implement the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity , deepen the reform of personnel system , and strive to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the tests of trials and tribulations ;  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
After Jiang Zemin spoke , Zhang Wannian said that Chairman Jiang 's important speech was imbued throughout with Marxist world-view and methodology and filled with the truth-seeking and innovative spirit of emancipating the mind and moving with the times ; its political , theoretical , ideological , and targeted properties were extremely strong , it has further pointed out the orientation for the whole party and the whole army to study in depth and implement the 1 July speech and fully implement the demands of the " three represents , " and is of major guiding significance .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
We have of late paid a visit to a certain air strike division of the Chinese Air Force , a hero unit known far and wide for its military prowess in the southeast , and interviewed the division 's Commander Zhang and political Commissar Su . What we saw and heard there has left us such a deep impression that the " fist " flight division has all along remained as a vanguard .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
Zhu Bangzao said : The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on further strengthening diverse cooperative relations between China and the four countries in the political , economic , trade , and cultural fields , and on international and regional issues , such as the establishment of a new international political and economic order , the Middle East issue , the Gulf situation , and the Iraq issue .  They reached broad consensus .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
A tremendous change , which is hardly detected by people , has occurred in the trend of China 's political thinking .  The change has occurred since China launched the drive of reform and opening up about 20 years ago .  The trend shows that a rational democratic concept and attitude has begun to be the main stream of social life , enabling China to have a very important and stable foundation for further political reform .  
Since the May Fourth Movement , the struggles engaged by the Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have always been accompanied by fierce political movements , with passionate mass parades and fervent slogans which are spread nationwide in a short period of time .  
Democracy must serve to resolve contemporary urgent social , political , or economic problems .  A parallel thinking is this : Whenever a political , economic , or social problem can not be resolved , people naturally pin their hopes on democracy .  
The great and universal imperial power has suppressed all democratic practices that seem promising .  It has made budding democracy disappear in the long river of history by killing it in the bud .  As a result , democracy has not been able to form a tradition in our political culture , or become a tradition of non-main stream .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
On the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : Taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .  Take its geographical conditions for an example .  Taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high-performance weapons into play .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
In the past year , the Chinese Government has made efforts to realize the people 's economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to promote and protect the citizens ' political rights , and has made remarkable progress in this respect , thus comprehensively raising the level of enjoying various human rights by the Chinese people .  
The Chinese Government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .  
Providing a panoramic view of the government 's work , this over-15,000-character Government Work Report is composed of 10 parts which cover the political , economic , social , and cultural fields , with more than half of its space devoted to economy-related contents .  Such a fact not only tallies with China 's present principle of " centering everything on the economy , " but has precisely reflected the expertise of this premier in economic management .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
The draft law specifically stipulates that it is the exclusive authority of the NPC and its standing committee to legislate the ten categories of laws that have a bearing on the state 's basic political system , economic system and legal system including civil and criminal laws , an authority that covers such fields as the deprival of civil and political rights , the punishment in terms of restricting the right to personal freedom , and litigation and arbitration systems .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
To safeguard the interests of their own bourgeois class , Western countries headed by the United States have used political , economic , and military means to enforce their political system , ideology , and human rights concept in the international community and to grossly interfere in the internal affairs and trample on the sovereignty of other countries .  
Most Taiwan securities dealers dared not be optimistic over the prospects of Taiwan 's securities markets in the future .  They believe : After undergoing a drastic change in its government , Taiwan will probably face drastic changes in its political and economic situations .  Moreover , since Taiwan investors are worried about the prospects of cross-strait ties , they will rush to sell off their shares .  They expected Taiwan stock market prices would successively plummet in the near future .  Most securities analysts are pessimistic and refused to predict how long the bearish market will last .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
In the latter half of the nineties , after the new constitution was endorsed in a referendum , Russia set up a presidential system and a republican regime , and Yeltsin was elected president .  However , his ties with the number one political party , Communist Party of the Russian Federation [ CPRF ] , worsened .  Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .  
It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
Both countries are developing counties ; and it is the hope of our both countries to give form to a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order at an early date .  
China 's diplomatic policy is to develop friendly ties of cooperation with all countries in the world based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , Zhu stated .  China is willing to further develop cooperation with Iran in the political , economic , and cultural fields .  
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .  
The central leadership holds that the appointments of new principal leaders to the State Sports General Bureau are proper , and the new leaders can support each other with their own strong points .  Zhang Bolin also put forward some requirements for the future work of the State Sports General Bureau : Enhance the sense of political responsibility , continue to advance the reform and development of sports ; consolidate and expand the results of " three stress " education , do a good job in party building and contingent building ;  
Luo Gan , secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission , who is in personal charge of this , has called on the state security departments , as well as the public security and armed police officers , in all localities to draw up meticulous plans and strike hard at the key Falungong elements who stir up trouble , in order to maintain political and social stability .  
The unitary state political system has played a tremendous role in promoting ethnic unity among the 56 ethnic groups , national unity , the coordinated development of various regions , and common prosperity .  
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and universally-acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in pushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .

Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
It should give full play to its political nucleus role and set a correct direction , goal and task for the development of Chinese culture .  It should formulate a correct line , guiding principle and policy , provide a staunch cultural and organizational guarantee and become the leader of the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  
It is reported that Guangzhou City held a national defense mobilization meeting last month .  Huang Huahua , secretary of the Guangzhou City CPC Committee , chaired the meeting in his capacity as the first political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region . He called on the relevant quarters in the city to seriously do good preparatory work for military struggle in the new period in accordance with the central authorities ' arrangements .  
He pointed out that under the unified leadership of the central authorities , the military and armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs regarded implementing the central policy decision as a serious political task and assigned it an important position ; they swept into action with a high sense of political responsibility and sense of work urgency , and got a really good grasp of implementation , with the result that this work has continually proceeded in a healthy and orderly way .  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
Through carrying out this work , not only have the military , armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs undergone testing in stressing politics , taking account of the overall situation , and observing discipline ; we have also found a number of effective measures and summed up a number of successful experiences , which provide a useful reference for unfolding specific items of tidying things up in the future .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
If in the future a problem again arises of some unit of the military , the armed police , or the political and legal organs engaging in business activities , we will hold accountable not only those directly responsible but also the leaders of that unit in accordance with the regulations on building good party style and clean government , and will strictly discipline them .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
We should make vigorous efforts to strengthen the building of political power at the grass-roots level in rural areas and turn them into strong fighting bastions to prevent and crack down on the criminal activities in abducting and trafficking in women and children .  
On cross-strait relations , he attempted to avoid one China , which is " fundamental " and adopted some soft means to strive to create some " obscure and blurred space , " so as to resist the appeal of the mainland motherland for developing cross-strait relations and starting political negotiations under the principle of one China .  
The side of the mainland motherland has also repeatedly expressed welcoming the visits of all the political parties , organizations , and personages from all circles in Taiwan , so as to exchange views and enhance common understanding on jointly opposing " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait relations , and pushing forward the progress of peaceful reunification .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
Family planning associations at the grass-roots level should take an active part in exercising democratic management and supervision over family planning and making family planning matters in the villages known to the public , and advance grass-roots democracy , legal institutions , and spiritual civilization , so as to promote social and economic development and political stability .  
In order to further strengthen Sino-African friendly cooperative ties , the Chinese Government has proposed the convocation of " Sino-African Cooperation Forum - - Beijing 2000 Ministerial Conference " in October this year , to jointly discuss with African nations such issues as how to push forward the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order and how to further strengthen Sino-African economic cooperation and trade in the 21st century .  
Relations of cooperation between the two countries have been constantly reinforced in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural fields ; there have been constant high-level contacts between the two armies ; and exchanges are being carried out in multiple fields and at multiple levels .  
The " five noes policy " is not some new olive branch extended by the new Taiwanese leaders , it is not their political bargaining chip , because as a minority leader , and with the DPP not the majority organization in the island 's public opinion , the points rejected in the " five noes " have strong support among those opposing " independence " in the opposition parties , which exercises a natural restraining action on the DPP . It is not something that any leader or the DPP can easily promote at will .  
Naturally , the speech also used words like " government for all the people , " " rule by the clean and upright , " following by promising to " seek the new , " " seek change , " " oppose ' black gold ' politics " which follow the mainstream of public opinion on the island .  Chen promised to fight for the support of all political factions and to balance the ruffled feelings of the 60 percent of the electorate which did not support him in the election .  
The " political power machine " which the KMT built while it was ruling the mainland was not completely destroyed during the KMT-CPC civil war , and after arriving in Taiwan it was concentrated , mended , and reformed into what is now this deformed " political power machine " which is " a province but not a province , not a state but claiming to be a state , and neither fish nor fowl . "  After taking up power , Chen Shui-bian can hardly resolve this problem for the time being .  
The anti-China activities of " Taiwan independence thinkers " were coordinated with those of western anti-China political forces and human rights organizations , with east and west singing in tune ; they groundlessly labelled the mainland of the motherland as " opposed to democracy and human rights " ; for instance they frequently applied their self-flaunted " democracy and human rights " to abuse the CPC 's opposition to " Taiwan independence " as oppressing Taiwan with " nationalism " and " great Han chauvinism . "  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Although the international situation has seen profound changes , China will continue to unswervingly pursue the independent and peaceful foreign policy , develop friendly cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and make joint efforts with other countries to build a just and rational new international political and economic order .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
It is necessary to firmly establish a correct outlook on education and qualified personnel , positively promote educational reform and development , take great pains to improve ideological and political education , moral education , education on discipline , and education on legal system , pay attention to the cultivation of enterprising spirit and practical ability , and seriously do a good job of lightening the excessively heavy homework assignments for the students of elementary and middle schools , so as to better promote children 's all-round development .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Although profound changes have taken place in the international situation , China will continue to firmly adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , develop friendship and cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence , and work jointly to build a new , fair , and reasonable international political and economic order .  
Li Peng , member of the Standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , stressed at the forum : In developing the western regions , we must properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; ensure a benign cycle for resources exploitation and ecological protection ; and leave our future generations with space for sustainable development .  
Patriotic scientists dedicated to the service of their country were unable to realize their goals .  Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , all the people of China went through an arduous struggle and won national independence and people 's liberation by the middle of the 20th century .  The new China was established , creating the basic political conditions for the flourishing development of China 's science and technology and other such undertakings .  
China 's political stability and economic development provide a solid , substantive technological foundation with the complete conditions and capability to catch up with the advanced tide of global science and technology .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is willing to establish friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world , including Yugoslavia , on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and to make joint efforts for the establishment of a new , peaceful , stable , just , and rational political order so that mankind will have a better tomorrow .  
As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
To this end we need to make unremitting exploration and constantly sum up experience .  As far as legislation is concerned , we will continue to uphold the principle of proceeding from China 's national conditions , safeguard consistency in the legal system based on the constitution , persist in the integration of legislation with major decisions concerning reform and development , ensure by the means of system and legislation the implementation of the state 's major political line , expedite socialist modernization , thus ensure the country 's prosperity and perpetual political stability .  
Many papers and periodicals are geared to the masses , the grass roots , and daily life , and persist in guiding people with correct public opinion ; the readers have welcomed them , and they have played a positive role in satisfying the political , economic , cultural , and daily life requirements of the masses and spurring the building of the two civilizations .  
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
Taiwan 's industrial and commercial circle , political sphere , scholars , and media were all disappointed , and even foreign businessmen also indicated their dissatisfaction .  Taiwan 's stock market continued to fall for straight five days .  The general index fell from 9,119 points on 19 May to 8430 points on 25 May , a fall of almost 700 points .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
This research fellow of the State Council 's Development Studies Center said that the main obstacle to foreign enterprises operating in China arises from problems in the domestic setup ; in 1997 the Chinese Government set " building a state with legal system " as the basic goal in the reform of China 's political setup , and we should now make practical efforts to achieve this .  
As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
He encouraged them to work hard and have a profound understanding of China 's independent foreign policy of peace .  He urged them to make active efforts to carry out their work .  He also urged them to introduce China 's situation to personages of political as well as other sectors in Slovenia so as to increase their understanding about China .  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago , China and Slovakia have made joint efforts to promote the constant development of friendly cooperation in the political , economic , military , science , technology , and cultural fields .  
In his " inaugural speech , " in order to leave a good impression , the new Taiwan leader used ambiguous and beautiful words to describe his viewpoints on the history , the nation , the state , and sovereignty .  His speech , extremely pitiable and ridiculous , yielded political results by comprehensively reflecting the shadow of the " two-state theory " and the soul of " independent Taiwan . "  
However , through the sudden change in the world history , the Taiwan authorities only caught sight of splittism and the " strategically favorable chance " of " creating another China . " As a result , the dregs under the Taiwan Strait were floating and the evil wind was blowing over the strait , thus turning the destiny of one China into a political magic and turning the ever-improving cross-strait relations since 1992 into ones " without agreements . "  
Correctly understanding their distinctive mentalities and behaviors is the basis for setting the goals , assignments , and requirements and developing the methods for ideological and political construction .  It is also the premise for making ideological and political work more relevant , systematic , and creative .  
Wen Jiabao called for the governments at all levels and pertinent departments in the disaster areas to firmly bear in mind the party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly , deepen their understanding of the anti-drought work from the high plane of stressing political awareness , be eager to meet the needs of the masses , think about what the masses are thinking about , and do a good job of providing relief to the disaster areas with warmth and enthusiasm in a solid manner .  
Third , we must work hard to build up a contingent of high-quality community workers ; and while giving full play to the role of existing committee cadres , we should also adopt effective measures to promptly replenish the contingent of community cadres .  Particularly , we should promote to the leading posts of communities a number of outstanding young cadres who have sound political qualities , a fairly high educational level , and a relatively strong work ability and who love the community work , so as to enhance the vigor and vitality of community leading bodies .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
The PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] General Political Department the other day issued a circular demanding that the party committees and political organs at all levels further unify ideological understanding ; strengthen organization and leadership ; earnestly guide in an all-round way the positive education on " three stresses " with Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " ; and see to it that the education will yield tangible results .  
Both sides stand for world multipolarization .  They stressed the necessity [ English version uses " need " ] to establish an equitable , just , fair and reasonable new international political and economic order that is free of hegemonism and power politics and is based on equality .  They indicated their readiness to work together for the establishment of such a new order .  
The two sides held that an earlier solution to the Afghanistan issue was in the interest of regional security and stability and stressed the need to seek a political settlement through negotiation between the parties concerned and establish a broad - based government representing all factions and ethnic groups . 
In the meantime , the two sides maintained that to look at the political , economic , social , cultural and civil rights , particularly the right to development in a comprehensive [ English version uses " balanced " ] manner and in the right perspective is of special significance to all countries .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
He stressed that since reform and opening up which started more than 20 years ago , relatively great achievements have been scored by China in various economic and social undertakings .  At present , China 's economic structural reform and political structural reform are being simultaneously carried out and continuously deepened .  Governing the country according to laws and building China into a country with socialist legal system have been written in the constitution as the general plan for the administration of the country .  
He emphasized that in the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , China 's economic and social undertakings have made good progress .  China 's restructuring of the economic system and political reform are being implemented at the same time and are continuously being deepened .  China has made governing the country according to law and constructing a socialist lawful country its general plan of government and has written that into its Constitution .  
Li Chongfu believes that " always be " and " faithful representative " mean that the party 's line , principles and policies and its overall political guidance formulated and implemented during any time must be adapted to the situation of that time and to local conditions , and they must reflect the law and requirements of the development of productive forces , reflect the wish of the working masses , and be able to promote the development of productive forces and the social progress .  
Originally , it was believed that the Senate would pass the bill without problem .  However , all of a sudden , halfway , out rushed a " Cheng Yaojin [ a character in a Chinese story ] , " who claimed that the Senate would not act as " rubber stamp " and demanded that some bills with strong colors of the US bipartisan political struggle , such as the bill on fiscal appropriations , and so on , be deliberated and examined together with the bill on granting the PNTR status to China .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
Viewed from another angle , if you do n't want to appraise in a most constructive , diversified and flexible way the reality that a political party and its leaders voluntarily proposed the policy of allowing a country to have two social and political systems and even two armies with their own commanders and that this policy won popular support , at least , you should believe that this country and its people have sufficient wisdom and ability to handle major issues of the state .  
He stressed : Over the 20-plus years of reform and opening up , the Chinese economy and various social undertakings have made great strides .  At present , the reforms of China 's economic and political structures are going synchronously and getting deeper and deeper .  We take the rule of law and the building of a socialist legal system as the blueprint for governing our country and have written it into the Constitution .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
through the struggle during the period of reform , our party did away with the shortcomings of the economic , political , science , educational , cultural , and other systems that were unable to meet demand of further development of productive forces , thus further liberating and developing productive forces .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
However , since the international community has failed to launch a forceful crackdown on organized international criminal gangs owing to the loopholes in the laws of certain countries , such as " political asylum " and " respect for human rights , " the activities of illegal migration have been revived like dying cinders glowing again and have persisted despite repeated prohibitions , thus doing tremendous harm to the society .  
As regards human rights , Li Peng has stressed and pointed out : It is impossible to demand that various countries follow the same viewpoint or mechanically transplant the same mode on the question of human rights , for human rights is an integral concept , and complete and common human rights should include not only the political rights of citizens but also the economic , social , and cultural rights , especially the right of survival and the right of development . 
Under the present new international and domestic situations , further doing a good job of cultivating and selecting minority cadres is of still greater importance to implementing the guidelines of the 15th national party congress and the central nationality work meeting , putting into effect Comrade Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " smashing the Western hostile forces ' political conspiracy of " Westernizing " and " dividing " China , accelerating the implementation of the large-scale western development , and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
When handling cases and problems , political and law organs are urged to enhance consciousness in the comprehensive management of public order , and while cracking down on law-breaking and on criminal activities , to consider problems from the angle of crime prevention , to search for reasons for criminal activity and to discover loopholes in the law through the handling of cases , to put forward preventive measures , to help relevant departments improve management system , strengthen education on the legal system , and implement preventive measures .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
To enhance understanding and increase consensus , the foreign ministries of the two countries set up a multilevel and multiform political consultation system , under which the two foreign ministers exchange visits and meet at the UN General Assembly and foreign ministry officials hold regular consultations .  
Chen Shui-bian calls the mainland 's struggle against " Taiwan independence " hegemonism , and has confused state sovereignty with human rights .  He has attempted to sow dissension among the compatriots in Taiwan , the international community , and the mainland , and publicly promoted official relations between Taiwan and the United States , in addition to meddling with the social and political affairs of the mainland .  
Meanwhile , along with the elimination of the feudal serf system , the cultural trait accompanying the old system that the Tibetan culture was monopolized by a tiny minority of serf owners will surely be " exterminated " ; and the old cultural autocracy featured by both an unification of the administration and the monastery and the dominance of region in Tibet 's entire social and political life will surely be eliminated .  This is a necessity in the development of the Tibetan history , and also a necessity in the development of the Tibetan culture .  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
While inheriting fine traditions , the ideological and political work in the new period has expanded unceasingly in the light of new developments and characteristics and gradually developed a complete set of policies and principles which can be summarized into adherence to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide ; 
The questions of how we should approach the current international and domestic situations , how we should approach the various problems cropping up in China 's reform and opening up especially in the course of building a socialist market economy , and how we should face the difficulties and challenges facing our economic and social lives all have to do with the political conviction of party-member cadres and all the more with the confidence and morale of the broad masses of the people .  It will not do not to face and not to look at them squarely .  
It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
A great era , magnificent goals , and arduous tasks set demands on us to firmly grasp the central link of the ideological education work .  All are urged to make this central ideological and political work conference a new starting point and a fresh motive force , and to do even better , down-to-earth , and effective ideological and political work .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
The circular urged that all units should treat the process of studying and carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a process of strengthening and improving the army 's ideological and political work .  Guided by the speech , they should further deepen the guiding spirit of the political work for the whole army .  We must make efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological-political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
Under conditions in which party work has been a part-time job In the past few years , we have done ideological and political work and engage in production and business operation at the same time and carried out varied and colorful enterprise-cultural activities ; by so doing , we have created a favorable environment full of healthy trends and encouraging people to make progress ; this has increased the cohesion of the enterprise and made the road of party building and ideological and political work broader and broader .  
Since its establishment , the enterprise 's economic efficiency and social effects have developed fast , to which the contribution of the highly effective ideological and political work can not be left unrecognized .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  They should further enhance the inspiring force , rally force , and fighting capacity of the ideological and political work .  
The two countries have maintained close political contacts and consultations , and have brought about a constant growth to their economic relations and trade ; what is more , our two countries have reached agreements on a number of major cooperative projects during a recent period , and this will surely produce a far-reaching influence on the bilateral relations between the two countries .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
Wang Zhaoguo pointed out that the united front has always paid attention to ideological and political work , especially since the Party 's 14th National Congress . With Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the Party 's Central Committee and with the ideological and political work of the united front as the key link in rallying and mobilizing people of all realms and all nationalities to bring about the responsibilities of the Party and country , it has effectively mobilized people of all realms to take part in modernization construction and enthusiasm for the glorious national rejuvenation .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
This requires us to have an insight into the general international situation and a profound understanding of China 's conditions .  It requires us to put forward a correct political line and formulate feasible principles and policies based on a clearly defined historical mission .  
During these 10 years , he bore all types of false charges that had no basis , was subjected to unprecedented humiliation , experienced a lifetime 's most difficult " coming out of retirement , " and faced the most chaotic and irrational political situation .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .  
The thinking of a " decisive battle offshore " and any overconfident military and political provocations are no doubt nonsensical and crazy practices and a risk that invites self-destruction .  Some people in Taiwan should rein in on the brink of the precipice .  
The pictorial , in vivid visual form and simple language , provides graphic and rich materials for party members to fully understand and grasp the essence of the " three represents " theory .  It is a teaching aid for grass-roots party organizations to step up and improve party ideological and political work .  
The party committees and political organs at all levels of the army and armed police held during their study that , guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory , Chairman Jiang 's important speech has comprehensively analyzed the international and domestic situation and the tasks facing ideological and political work , profoundly explained the important role of ideological and political work in the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and specifically proposed the guidelines and principles for further strengthening and improving ideological and political work .  
During their studies the officers and men of the army and the armed police pointed out that ours is a people 's army under the party 's absolute leadership , and strong and effective ideological and political work is the political strong point in our development and growth and our cherished magic weapon for defeating the enemy .  We must unswervingly assign ideological and political work the primary position in all work .  
President Jiang Zemin delivered a written speech at the airport .  He said mankind is looking forward to the dawn of the 21st century , adding that people hope this century will be a century of peace and development , for the establishment of a new , just and rational international political and economic order in this century , and for brilliant human civilization in this century .  
11 .  The two sides emphasize the importance of exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern .  They are willing to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation and work to build a just and rational international political and economic new order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the " UN Charter " and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
It became the first book which introduced China to the West . On 6 November 1970 , China and Italy formally established diplomatic ties , thereby opening up a new chapter of friendship and cooperation .  Both countries have made comprehensive progress in facilitating political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological cooperation .  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
Chen Zhili stressed : While fully affirming our achievements , we must soberly notice that there are still quite pronounced problems facing party building and ideological and political work in colleges and universities and that we are faced with a more complicated situation , heavier tasks , and more arduous work ahead .  
In view of this and in consideration of the current regional and surrounding geopolitical circumstances , all sides have determined to deepen cooperation in the political , diplomatic , economic and trade , military , military technological , and other fields to consolidate regional peace and stability .  
6 .  All sides indicate they will resolutely uphold the purpose and principles of the UN Charter ; restate the legitimate rights of all countries to choose their own paths of political , economic , and social development according to their national conditions ; oppose intervention in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretexts of " humanitarianism " and " protecting human rights ; " and support the efforts of one another in safeguarding the five countries ' national independence , sovereignty , territorial integrity , and social stability .  
From Shanghai , Moscow , Alma-Ata , Bishkek to Dushanbe , the degree of military confidence among the five countries along their borders has constantly risen , border problems left over by history have been settled gradually , cooperation in the area of political security has been constantly deepened , consensus over regional and international matters has been constantly expanded , and economic and trade cooperation has developed day by day .  
11 .  Both sides emphasized that exchanging views on global and regional issues of common concern is of great significance , and are willing to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation and to make efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order on the basis of the purpose and principles of the UN Charter as well as established principles of international laws .  
Over the past eight-odd years since China and Turkmenistan established diplomatic ties , both countries have gradually expanded mutually-beneficial political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational cooperation , and attained good results in this regard .  
As far as the domestic situations in these newly independent countries are concerned , generally speaking they are still in the transitional period of system restructuring and have a lot of economic and political issues to be resolved .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
intensified the support of the treasury for the development of the social security system ; continued to increase the input into agriculture , forestry , and water resources management , as well as the protection of the ecological environment ; comprehensively implemented the decision taken by the CPC Central Committee to stop armed forces , the armed police force , and political and judicial organs from engaging in business activities ;  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech shows great foresight , has the overall situation in view , contains rich and profound ideas , possesses the distinct features of the times , and aims at very definite objectives , which is of momentous practical significance as well as far-reaching historical significance to intensifying and improving the party 's ideological and political work oriented to the new century .  We must study the gist of the speech and put it into practice in a conscientious manner .  
However , we should fully understand the importance , protracted nature , and arduousness of intensifying the building of spiritual civilization , firmly foster the political awareness and the awareness on general interest , responsibility , ideological front , and innovation , and further increase the sense of mission , urgency , and the age , so as to carry out the building of spiritual civilization in a still more vivid , enlivened , and solid way .  
Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .  However , the quality of judges and procurators should not be reflected in their academic qualifications alone .  Examination only reveals professional standards , whereas other factors , such as political integrity and vocational ethics , can only be assessed by practical work .  
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
Regrettably , out of political considerations , a number of developed country shareholders willfully trampled on the World Bank charter , imposed conditions on the relevant recommendation report prepared by the World Bank administrative authorities , and raised unreasonable demands in another attempt to obstruct the project 's implementation .  
By grasping the " new reality , " " new problems , " " new demands , " and " new development " in accordance with the demands of the four " close connections , " and carrying out active explorations , we can carry out ideological and political work in a still more vivid and dramatic and effective way .  
The fundamental switch from planned to socialist market economy has brought about tremendous changes in China 's social life and has also set new challenges and demands on ideological and political work .  
To achieve practical results in ideological and political work , it is necessary to closely combine it with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , and concentrate efforts on masking an issue of " new development " ; we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , ways , means , and mechanisms , and continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
By grasping the four " new " things , upholding the four " close connections , " and carrying out work in a creative way , ideological and political work will be closer to the era , the masses , and daily life , will be effectively intensified and improved , and will also be able to give fuller play to its role as spiritual motive force and political guarantee .  
In this way , the Taiwan side can achieve its goal of substituting the fake for the genuine .  When Li Denghui [ Lee Teng-hui ] was in power , the Taiwan authorities played all kinds of tricks .  The Taiwan authorities interpreted the statement as " two equal political entities , " " one China , one Taiwan , " and " one China in future tense " before dishing out their " two states theory . "  
Zhu Rongji made clear to the countries visited that China holds an active attitude of developing bilateral ties , and emphasized China 's willingness to strengthen political dialogue and consultations with these countries on the basis of mutual respect , reciprocity based on equality , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
The speech has been made , the goal has been set , the road has been clearly pointed out , and the key lies in the whole party getting to work to vigorously grasp implementation and carry out ideological and political work in a more extensive , deep-going , vivid and dramatic , and effective way .  
The party 's ideological and political work must be continually strengthened and improved in light of the continually changing reality in the new historical period , and can not be relaxed or weakened in the slightest .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Fourth , in close connection with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , methods , means , and mechanisms to continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
We must lay stress on forms and methods in ideological and political work , and strive to make it vivid and lively and attractive to the eye and ear ; it should soak into the depths of the heart like life-giving spring breeze and rain , and exert imperceptible influence like a silent lubricant .  
Igor Rogachev said : " The development of strategic cooperative partnership with China is a fundamental principle in Russia 's foreign policy .  The principle can not be altered and has won support from major social and political power in Russia . "  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
Reportedly , Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will have a separate meeting with his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian tomorrow afternoon.An authoritative figure here disclosed that the political topic of Putin 's visit to China would mainly involve international strategic security , anti-missile , and regional hot issues .  In addition , Putin 's visit to China is regarded as informing the Chinese side of Russia 's position at the G-8 Summit and relevant matters .  
The correct way to adapt oneself to the new challenges in international security , safeguard world peace , and protect the legitimate security interests of different countries is not to undermine the " ABM Treaty " but to push forward the establishment of a new , just , and rational international political order , abandon power politics and the arbitrary use of force in international affairs , and further strengthen regional and international security .  
Zhu Bangzao said , there is another important content of this statement , that is , non-strategic ABM defensive systems that are not banned under the ABM treaty , and international cooperation in this field , should not damage the security of other countries , should not lead to the establishment and strengthening of closed military and political blocs , and should not damage global and regional stability and security .  
Leaders of the two countries extensively and profoundly exchanged their views on strengthening political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational , and local cooperation between the two countries , as well as bilateral and international issues of mutual concern , including the question of anti-ballistic missiles .  
The participants unanimously held that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech was a brilliant exposition and very rich in content .  It was strongly political and theoretical in nature and it stressed the important position of theoretical work .  It put forward the tasks and demands on theoretical work , and explained a series of major theoretical and practical fundamental issues that concern the overall situation .  
The DPRK and Russia acknowledged that every country has the right to decide its own road to political , economic , and social development .  They opposed interference in other countries ' internal affairs under the pretext of " humanitarianism " and supported each other in their efforts to safeguard their own independence , sovereignty , and territorial integrity .  
Yu Yongbo said emphatically : The important speech given by Chairman Jiang at the central ideological and political work conference profoundly expounded on a host of major issues in strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation .  A policy document of great theoretical and guiding significance , the speech further pointed the way for us to cope with the overall situation of party and government work and to do a good job in ideological and political work in the military .  
At that forum , which was presided over by Nanjing MR Commander Liang Guanglie , Fang Zuqi also reminded the responsible persons from the upper echelons of the party committees in the Nanjing MR to " strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the army " and " make great efforts to provide a powerful mental motive force for winning a war " in the process of making preparations for military struggle .  
In the face of a complicated and changing post-Cold War international situation , the two countries share broad consensus in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries , and in building a new international political and economic order that is just and rational . 
It is necessary to build a contingent of ideological and political workers who are politically strong , professionally competent , highly disciplinary , and upright , according to the requirements of improving quality , optimizing the structure , and integrating full-time workers with part-time workers .  
Particularly in the extraordinary 20th century , the unyielding and hard-working Asian people have written another grand epic of political awakening and economic takeoff through their unremitting efforts for prosperity .  They have thus strongly promoted the historical progress and social development .  
These principles have been commonly accepted as the norms governing state-to-state relations , and they have played a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the promotion of friendship and cooperation among developing countries .  They have also already played and will continue to play a significant role in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
A new international political and economic order should be based itself upon the universally recognized norms governing international relations , meet the need of the development and progress of our times and reflect the spirit of peace and equality .  It should ensure that all countries , regardless of their size , wealth and strength , are all equal members of the international community .  
He hoped that the two sides would continue maintaining close cooperation ; enhance mutual support in the areas of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ; put forth joint efforts opposing interference from without , promoting the establishment of a just and rational new world political and economic order , and protecting the legitimate rights of developing nations .  
When Hong Kong moved into the final years of the transitional period , the last governor dispatched by the British side dished out a " three violation " political reform scheme , tried hard to foster their political proxy and extend the influence of their colonial rule , and attempted to create disorder and confusion to undermine the comprehensive implementation of the Basic Law in the future SAR .  
Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1992 , relations between the two countries have developed in a sustained and steady manner .  Their cooperation in the political , economic , security , cultural , and other fields also has scored remarkable achievements .  
and ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992 , the two countries have achieved fruitful results in constantly expanding mutual exchange and cooperation in political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and other fields as well as in international affairs .  
established and perfected rules and regulations ; and have satisfactorily resolved many " long-standing , big , and difficult " issues which long defied solution .  Through the education and rectification activity , the vast numbers of cadres in leading organs have enhanced their political awareness and the awareness of responsibility , and have pledged one after another to set an example for the troops with their own conduct in fulfilling the requirement of " three represents . "  
The facts are , since assuming office on 1 July 1997 , Chief Executive Tung has led the SAR government in smoothly and effectively overcoming the assaults of a string of external factors as well as the political , social , economic , and people 's livelihood problems left over from the British Hong Kong Government era to win the central government 's great trust internally and international commendation externally .  
2 .  On the other hand , an unprecedented great mass fervor in visiting the mainland and conducting cross-strait exchanges has arisen among Taiwan 's political parties , nongovernmental organizations , and representatives of popular will .  This is something really worth welcoming and really heartening because the people on both sides are the forces that will ultimately decide the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
Luo Gan said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very much concerned about Xinjiang 's economic development and social and political stability .  The task of maintaining Xinjiang 's social and political stability is arduous so I hope that Xinjiang 's judicial organs , under direct leadership of the regional party committee and government , will further seek consensus , strengthen cooperation , duly focus attention on the drive to improve social order , and carry out other special struggles .  
The " three stresses " education has been conducting at party committees above regiment level and grass-roots party organizations , the cohesive and combat forces of party committees at all levels have been generally strengthened , the ideological and political level of the vast number of party members have been raised to a new plane , troops of the whole army have been conducting mass scientific and technological training activities in a down-to-earth way and their capability for defensive battles under modern conditions has been further intensified ;  
Chi Haotian emphasized that we should unswervingly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army , vigorously strengthen the ideological and political building of troops , earnestly study Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study a series of expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin , resolutely implement President Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents , " continue conducting the " three stresses " education in a profound way , enhance the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , and keep the political color of our army forever .  
They said their current first visit to China as " Troika " foreign ministers fully demonstrates the great importance the Rio Group attaches to developing its relations with China . They hoped the visit would not only promote cooperation between the Rio Group and China in political , economic and trade , and social fields , but also increase the possibility of their cooperation in scientific and technological and information fields , so that their relationship will develop in width and depth .  
contribute to help maintaining world peace and promoting common development ; and while stressing political dialogue , enhance bilateral exchanges and cooperation in economic , trade , financial , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational areas , so that the dialogue mechanism becomes a major channel in pushing forward mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Latin America .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .  
Seventy years ago , facing the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries , Mr . Deng Yanda established the Interim Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang , the predecessor of the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party , and explicitly set forth the political program of overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek regime by means of armed force and establishing a political power of common people with peasants and workers as the main body .  After Mr .  
In the new historical period , the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party firmly supports the line , principles , and policies adopted by the CPC since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , conscientiously performs its functions as a political party participating in the government , and does effective work for promoting national economic and cultural development , safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity , and promoting the great cause of the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
Many in the political circles , public opinion , and even the " vice president " Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] , all hold a reserved attitude toward Chen Shui-bian 's trip .  They believe that Chen Shui-bian 's trip does not conform to what is appropriate for the present time , is full of variables , and that it will be difficult to gain any positive results .  As well , they think it is bound to have a negative impact on the already turbid cross-strait relations .  
Many comrades have even given their precious lives !  However , when measured by the standard of the requirement of the " three represents , " our police contingent still lags far behind in terms of its political , ideological , and professional quality , as well as in its discipline and work style .  
On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
Luo Gan stressed : We should persistently arm the mind of the vast numbers of public security officers with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the gist of a series of important speeches made by Comrade Jiang Zemin ; constantly enhance their consciousness and firmness in implementing the party 's basic line ; and see to it that the police contingent can always retain its political color of being loyal to the party , to the motherland , to the people , and to the law .  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
So long as we seize the opportune time to implement the spirit of the central ideological and political work conference , seriously sum up our successful experience of the preceding stage , and earnestly overcome the weak links in our work , we will certainly be able raise the " double thinking " educational activities to a higher level .  
Qiu Xueqiang , director of the Political Department of the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , said : In conducting the " three kinds of education , " we should focus our attention on improving the quality of the procurators ' ranks as a whole , especially their ideological and political quality , so that they will become a force that is united with revolutionary ideals and conviction , that will unswervingly subordinate itself to the interests of the whole , and that is brave in fighting and will not worry the party re any degeneration .  
The Pachang River incident has produced an unprecedented impact on Taiwan 's politics .  The administrative ability of the new government has all the more been called into question , and the political situation on the island is not stable .  Most public opinion thinks this is a very inappropriate time for the leader of the Taiwan authorities to visit abroad .  
On the other hand , we must see that the factors constraining the economic rebound , such as insufficient effective social demand , conspicuous structural contradictions in the economy , continued " obstructions " to developing the consumer goods market , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes , remain very prominent , and we must maintain effective political direction and support to provide correct guidance for the economic momentum .  
Carrying out comprehensive institutional reform is a strategic task set by the 15th CPC Congress , is urgently required by the establishment of a socialist market economic system , and is an important part of political system reform .  
The forum seriously studied and implemented the spirit of the important speech delivered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the Central Ideological and Political Work Conference , discussed how to enhance the convincing and combat effectiveness of theoretical work , how to make ideological and political work more specific and effective , and how to make propaganda , ideological work , and spiritual civilization better serve the development of the west region .  
It is reported that Lee Yuan-tseh has lately been pondering deeply over cross-strait topics .  He understands that it will not be easy to synthesize differing views into a concrete conclusion , given the resistance from the major political parties and the wide political spectrum from which the task force 's members come .  However , he is still hopeful that the cross-party task force will present a set of recommendations that will get the two organizations across the Taiwan Strait to resume negotiations within the institutional framework .  
As officials responsible for " security of their own area , " the party committees and government at all levels should frequently concern themselves with the progress of the investigation and handling of the contradictions and disputes .  Regarding the major contradictions and outstanding problems that might affect social stability , they should personally get involved , go deep into the realities of life , do well meticulous ideological and political work , seriously mitigate the contradictions , and resolve the problems .  
As officials directly responsible for maintaining social stability , the leading comrades responsible for political and legal work and for comprehensive management of social order should vigorously organize and coordinate with all the departments concerned , share the work with individual responsibility , pool efforts , create a situation of everyone getting involved in the work , and promote the investigation and handling of contradictions and disputes .  
The principal leaders of the party committees and the governments at various levels , as the number one responsible person for " ensuring local peace and stability , " should constantly be concerned about the situation of the contradiction and dispute investigation and mediation work , personally take a hand in handling any major contradictions and conspicuous problems that affect local social stability , go deep into the realities of life , do a thorough and meticulous ideological and political work , and seriously resolve contradictions and problems .  
Cooperation and exchanges in the political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , and public health spheres have continued to expand with great results .  And the close cooperation in international and regional affairs has been strengthened with each passing day .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
While paying attention to the pattern of modern education , the " Opinions " have also made use of the PLA 's political superiority .  The " Opinions " have summarized and incorporated the PLA 's basic experiences of strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances .  The " Opinions " are currently , and will be for some time in the future , an important guiding document for strengthening ideological and political education in military academies .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
For more than 20 years of reform and opening up , especially since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the reform of the personnel system relating to cadres , under the leadership of the party Central Committee , has developed and deepened step by step with the progress of the reform of the economic and political systems , scoring tremendous achievements .  This has provided a systematic guarantee for training a contingent of cadres who can fit in with the needs of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
Since the securities commission and its affiliated organizations practiced the vertical management , party committees at all levels have done a lot of work in intensifying the party building and ideological and political work .  However , compared with the duties and missions shouldered by the securities regulatory departments and with the requirements of the party central committee and the State Council , it is still not enough .  
Yan Haiwang said : The intensification of ideological and political work must serve the party 's central work , and the achievements obtained by the securities sector in the ideological and political work must be embodied in the intensified supervision and control , the ensured healthy operation of the securities market , and the accelerated economic reform and development .  
Yan Haiwang stressed that to intensify the ideological and political work , it is imperative to strengthen the leadership , so the leading bodies at all levels must persist in " stressing theoretical study , stressing political awareness , and stressing ethical conduct , " place the ideological and political work in an important position , establish and amplify the ideological and political work responsibility system , make regular study , step up examination , and earnestly " do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both . "  
( 6 ) carrying out an extensive and thorough education on professional ethics in the entire sector ; in line with the requirements for being " up to the mark in politics , excellent in profession , upright in style , and strict in discipline , " taking the love and respect for work and observation of law and discipline as main contents , intensifying internal management in a bid to further heighten the ideological and political quality and work ability ;  
( 7 ) in light of the five basic requirements that the " leading bodies are staunch and powerful , the party member cadres are pure and up to the mark , the work system of party building is sound , the mechanisms of ideological and political work are perfect , and the work performance is outstanding , " and the three basic conditions of " firm political stand , prominent professional abilities , and excellent work style , " launching activities on creating advanced grassroots party organizations and striving to be fine Communist party members ;  
A government worker from Taichung named Chen Meijin , and a Kaohsiung businessman named Chen Yuqi , both believe that " money diplomacy " will not bring Taiwan any visible benefits , and that the Taiwan authorities should devote themselves to wiping out black gold [ political corruption ] , enhancing social benefits , and improving public security .  These are the problems that the public is really concerned about .  
In particular , in the contemporary world , from nature to human society , from the economic and political realms to culture and science , things are developing and changing at a speed unimaginable to people in the previous periods .  
The opposition parties have been continuously bombarding the National Reunification Council , and the outlook for the " Chen-Lien Meeting " has changed .  Subsequently the roundtable of political parties may be in the dilemma of breaking up .  Moreover , discontent within the DPP as the minority ruling party is continuing to brew , with the grudge directed at the financial and economic cabinet members .  
We must treat thorough strengthening of Party building and ideological and political work , upholding Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide , upholding implementation of consciousness of the Party 's basic line and educational policy , upholding the socialist direction for running a school , strengthening the ideological front , and providing reliable political guarantees and organizational assurances in order to promote reform and development of schools and nurturing of successors for building socialism as the outstanding substance and requirements of " three stresses " education for higher educational institutions .  
Over the past dozen years or so , Zhang Ping , who began to write in 1981 , has written such anticorruption masterpieces as " The Sky Dragnet , " " The Law Has Shaken Western Shanxi , " and " Ambush from All Sides . " He did that by displaying ample political enthusiasm and a high sense of social obligations , as well as by withstanding numerous pressures and breaking through many barriers .  He has been known as " a writer who sings the march of fighting corruption and encouraging honesty . "  
In addition to striving to stabilize the political situation , plan economic reform , pacify Chechnya , reorganize the armed forces , and declare war on the increasingly influential financial oligarchs and local warlords , he has also been actively and steadily readjusting Russia 's foreign policy and intensely pursuing a pragmatic diplomacy .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
Confronted with the new situation marked by increasingly frequent updating and upgrade of naval weapon systems and equipment and their constantly rising technological level , the academy has given full play to the leading and service-ensuring roles of the ideological and political work in meeting the requirements of this new situation .  
We should care about the old people 's ideology , actively explore new formats and new ways of doing ideological and political work under the new situation , and broadly launch healthy and beneficial cultural and sports activities , so that the masses of old people can enjoy their late years and live a healthy , scientific , and civilized lifestyle .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Both the international situation and the domestic situation are changing very rapidly and drastically , and our tasks are very arduous and complex .  To do a good job in reform and development and in ensuring stability , the leading cadres must possess a Marxist political sensitivity , know how to discover problems from a high political vantage point and solve them , and adhere to principle , take a systematic approach , and enhance their foresight and creativity in work .  
A major task to expedite the development of minority nationality areas is to vigorously train minority nationality cadres of various levels , improve their political and cultural expertise , enable them to guide the economic development of minority nationality areas , and educate and guide , through these cadres , the masses of minority nationalities to change their ideas and to concentrate on developing production , improving living condition , casting off poverty , and becoming rich .  
We sincerely hope that all relevant factions in Burundi will value the peace and stability of the country and the fundamental interests of the people above everything else , completely abandon the tribal and ethnic feud based on the spirit of national reconciliation , and resolve the existing differences by continuing to engage in dialogue and negotiations , so as to finally bring about lasting peace and political stability and economic development of the country .  
According to the current conditions in ideological and political work in the state security organs , Xu Yongyue put forward eight measures for reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , strengthening ideal and belief education , building and managing the cadre contingent , and consolidating leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations .  
The state security organs should continue to carry forward its fine tradition in doing ideological and political work , provide strong and effective political guarantees for the state security work under the new situation , successfully fulfill all tasks assigned by the party central leadership , and triumphantly advance the cause of state security into the 21st century .  
This demands that the leadership groups and leading cadres of these institutes possess a high degree of political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions ; they must take a firm and clear-cut stand on questions of political orientation and fundamental principles ; they must conduct education and put things right with regard to erroneous ideology and political viewpoints that run counter to regarding economic construction as the central task , to reform and opening up , and to the four cardinal principles ;  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
The rapid progress of science and technology in the world , especially the development of information technology , has created new and broad prospects for the development of the productive force and the society .  It is creating a profound influence on political , economic , military , science and technology , culture and social fields of various countries .  
The broad masses of national and religious people must fully understand the hypocritical and reactionary nature of the Dalai separatist clique , uphold and carry forward the fine tradition of patriotism , and firmly resist the penetration and sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces from outside the borders .  Cadres and people of all nationalities must extremely cherish and safeguard stability with a high level of political consciousness ; respect and support one another in their work and life ;  
In order to open up a new vista in carrying out ideological and political work , the CPC Central Committee had promulgated the " Several Suggestions of the CPC Central Committee on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and Political Work " in September 1999 .  The institutions of higher learning in Shanghai put forward their views on carrying out ideological and political work on the computer network and in academic organizations and societies and in classrooms .  This is aimed at occupying all educational fields and creating a fine environment for the healthy growth of young students .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
Leading bodies and leading cadres in colleges and universities have universally received education in basic Marxist tenets , party spirit , and party conduct and tempering in relatively strict inner-party political life and thus achieved new improvement in their ideological and political quality .  
Only when great importance is attached to ideological and political work ; the quality of students is improved comprehensively ; and qualified people are turned out can firm ideals and conviction as well as a firm orientation of running a school be embodied .  
In its effort to strengthen leading body construction and ideological and political work and build itself into a domestically first-class and internationally renown university , Beijing Institute of Technology conscientiously worked out numerous rules and regulations and adopted a lot of effective and practical measures .  After its rectification and reform plan was made public , the masses responded to it strongly and maintained that leaders of the institute had grasped the crux of the matter and something significant could be achieved in its development .  
We are happy to see that with the joint efforts of both sides , the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries have constantly developed in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Lithuania nine years ago . 
There are three basic principles that must be emphasized in establishing a new peaceful , stable , fair and rational international political and economic order : First , all countries should be equal irrespective of their size .  Second , the right of the peoples of various countries in choosing the road of development according to respective national conditions should be respected .  Third , the sovereignty of all countries should not be violated and under no pretext should the internal affairs of other countries be interfered in .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
As the most representative and most authoritative international organization of sovereign states , the United Nations has played an irreplaceable role in maintaining world peace , promoting common development , and in establishing a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
Since then , the two countries have constantly enhanced their mutual understanding and trust and expanded their cooperation year by year in the political , economic , cultural , educational and scientific and technological fields .  
Given that domestic political factors , especially the attitude of the US Congress , are exerting a growing influence on Sino-US relations , bilateral relations will be faced more stern challenges , and all kinds of unpredictable complications will force the leaders on both sides to keep adjusting their respective stands .  Whoever can come up with more specific policies and measures that can exert pressure on the other side will have the upperhand in this intangible trial of strength .  
and added an enchanting brilliance to the prosperity and development of the global economy .  China 's stable political situation , social security , and an economy that has always maintained a relatively high speed of development , are key to China 's achievements in attracting foreign business investments .  
During his successful visit to the three Baltic countries of Lithuania , Estonia and Latvia , Li Peng expressed his wish to further promote cooperation with the Baltic countries in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific and technological field on the principle of " enhancing understanding , improving trust , promoting friendship and increasing consensus " and to further strengthen friendly relations between China and the Baltic countries on the parliamentary and other levels .  The visit produced important results .  
Through their joint efforts in the nine years since the establishment of diplomatic relations , China and the three Baltic countries have continuously developed friendly and cooperative ties in the political , economic , cultural and other fields and have been able to cooperate positively with one another in international affairs .  
He said , China-EU relations have shown good development momentum in recent years , thanks to the joint efforts of the two sides ; leaders of the two sides often meet , political dialogue and consultation have been fruitful , and cooperation in economic , trade , scientific , technological , and other areas has further expanded .  
He said : The UN millenium summit meeting has closed .

In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .

Under this situation filled with opportunities , competition , and challenges , if our judges fail to pay attention to improving their study and enhancing their level and fail to pay attention to updating their knowledge in order to heighten their political , legal , moral , and professional quality as quickly as possible , they will not be able to meet the requirements for the development of judicial work and will be eliminated in the end .

The two armed forces have also further developed their relations on the basis of bilateral ties .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
After the five countries in the region gained independence in the early 1990 ' s , they banned extremist religious and nationalist political bodies and openly cracked down on extremists threatening social stability .

While carrying out ideological and political work , the people 's courts at various levels should ceaselessly strengthen education in communist ideals .  Under the conditions for strengthening the market economy , courts should pay attention to cultivating and enhancing judges ' moral quality and lay a solid foundation for the broad masses of cadres and policemen to justly enforce the law and work diligently for the people .  
Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , our Party has led the people in the unwavering promotion of reforms of the economic and political systems , establishing and promoting a socialist market economy system , developing socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics , and liberating and developing the social productive forces to the maximum , raising China 's overall national strength to a new level .

The " Falungong " cult organization has also made great efforts to employ the so-called " political elite and senior consultants , " nurture and plant trusted and backbone followers , and racked their brains to infiltrate the party and government organs , especially vital departments , so as to spy out confidential information of the party and the government .  Furthermore , they deployed a second echelon in a planned and organized manner in an attempt to avoid being cracked down on , and to wage long-term confrontation with the party and the government .

China has not yet completed its transition from a planned economy to a market economy and the restructuring of the political system is still in its infancy .

In a special article , China Times described the coming together and eventual parting of ways between Chen and Tang as " the nuclear explosion of the Chen-Tang system " with devastating results to all sides , saying that it not only put a full-stop to " government of the whole people " but cast unpredictable variables to the already disturbing political situation .  
He emphasized that the people would be faced with " political instability , " " economic collapse , " " mistrust of the international community in Taiwan 's policies " and other situations in the days ahead , and Taiwan would become the kind of place which Confucius described as " not fit to go to or to live in .

The CCDI standing committee is of the opinion that Comrade Xu Penghang , as a party member and leading cadre , exploited his position to help Kangsai Company with its floatation and supported and took part in his family 's purchase of employee shares to make a huge profit .  His behavior has seriously undermined the clean and honest behavior expected of government officials while performing their functions , caused very bad political damage , and constituted a serious violation of discipline .

They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .

Since the new leader of Taiwan assumed office , he has never recognized the one-China principle , opposing reunification overtly and pursuing " independence " covertly , totally devoid of sincerity in improving cross-strait relations .  As a result , cross-strait relations continue to remain tense and a political crisis cropped up .  This is an even more serious background and deeper cause for the failure of his cabinet .

Their common goals are : Actively explore China 's enormous market , strive hard to bring China into the world economic and international political systems dominated by the West , use the game rules formulated by Western countries , which are led by the United States , to restrain China , maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait , prevent armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait , strengthen ties with regional allies , and step up the efforts to contain and guard against China in the security domain .  
3 .  Both sides stress the importance of exchanging views on international and regional issues of common concern , and express the willingness to promote bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation .  China and Armenia will work for the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order based on the purpose and principles of the United Nations Charter and other widely recognized norms governing international relations .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
In measuring China 's political system and political party system , the fundamental point is to proceed from China 's national conditions and from the actual results of China 's revolution , construction , and reform .  First , we must see whether the system can promote the sustained development of the social productive forces and comprehensive social progress .  
The proposition of these criteria has an important practical bearing on dispelling misunderstanding , unifying our understanding , further upholding and improving the CPC-led multiparty cooperative system and the political consultative system , consciously resisting the influence of the Western-style two-party or multiparty system , and holding firm to a correct political direction .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
[ Wang ] Upon entering the new century , the party 's basic requirements on united front work are : Holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism ; uniting with all the forces that can be united ; mobilizing all positive factors ; turning negative factors into positive ones ; catering to the establishment of socialist economy , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics ; catering to the political situation of stability and unity ; catering to the realization of the motherland 's complete reunification ; catering to world peace ; and catering to common development .  
he laid very great stress on the question of how to fight to win a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and demanded that the armed forces have a clear understanding of the new situation , further enhance their awareness of hardship , and step up their training with a high degree of political responsibility and the sense of urgency of seizing the day ; they should also make military training more targeted and narrow the gap between training and actual combat . 
They should devote more efforts to guiding the work , coordinating the efforts of various sectors , and solving in a timely manner the difficulties and problems that may be encountered in the struggle .  All police sectors and departments should put stress on the political work and the interest of the whole , uphold and carry forward the fine tradition of public security organs , coordinate closely , and cooperate wholeheartedly .  
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
They focus on establishing the correct world outlook , life outlook , and concept of value to vigorously improve the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , regard cadres , especially cadres at senior and intermediate levels , as focal points to employ the spirit of rectifying work styles to resolve those outstanding issues in the aspects of party styles , clean and honest administrations , and revolutionary integrity , thus conducting the " four educations " in a vivid and lively manner and a solid and effective manner .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
As a fundamental engineering project of strengthening the ideological and political building of the army during the new era , the " four educations " have answered and resolved a series of fundamental issues about affirming revolutionary ideals and convictions like how to propagate the excellent traditions during the new era , how to lay a solid ideological foundation for establishing oneself and conducting oneself in life , and so on .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
Jia Qinglin stressed that the general requirement for the work of elderly cadres in the Beijing Municipality in a period of time to come should be closely revolving round the overall situation of the capital 's work and focusing on grasping well the political treatment and living treatment for elder cadres to fulfill all policies for elderly cadres , strengthen their ideological and political work , and strive to create excellent conditions for the care , medical treatment , teaching , learning , activities , and entertainment of elder cadres .  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
China 's economic development potentials and its vast potential market , the unique role it plays in Asian affairs , its political influence among the developing countries , its special geopolitical status and future prospects of " great China " [ da zhong hua ] , and the acceleration of its military modernization - - all these factors mean that the US government and public can not but attach greater importance to China 's weight in the future international political pattern and its influence in world affairs .  
Senior leader of Taiwan 's industrial circles and chairman of Taiwan 's giant Formosa Plastics Group Wang Yung-ching recently made frequent harsh criticisms of the mistakes committed by the leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party administration and expressed his deep anxiety toward the current political and economic chaos in Taiwan .  
Consequently , the common objectives that the two major parties in the United States have been pursuing in recent years as far as China is concerned are : to vigorously exploit the huge market in China , with a view to bringing China into the West-led world economic system and international political system , so as to restrain China with the rules of game laid down by Western countries ;  
In the past 50 years , Chinese private enterprise went though all kinds of ups and downs as the state political situation changed .  After reform and opening up began , the policies of " helping the state and restricting the private " made it hard for private enterprises for a while .  Private enterprises were described as an economic community growing up in " gray shadows . "  For a long time , it was not finding much of a place in mainstream awareness .  Now , however , the private economy has begun to take off .  
" Related sectors " indicated that Taiwan 's current economic warning signals undoubtedly reflect fundamental problems and , even more so , elements of political unrest .  These elements have had a negative psychological impact that resulted in numerous economic measures failing to immediately achieve their expected results .  The fundamental policy of " long-term accumulation of short-term blows " caused a mutually destructive situation that was definitely not the people 's good fortune .  
the logistical department of CSF 's fourth division ; and the deputy planning minister office of CSF 's fifth division , a communication and information office of CSF 's sixth division and a deputy director of political warfare office of CSF 's seventh division will be established .  The deputy director of the political warfare office will be a lieutenant general-level post , and filled by the current deputy director of the Political Warfare Department .  
The Chinese Government and people are speeding up reforms of the economic and political systems , putting into effect an economic and social development strategy geared to the 21st century , and practicing an administrative strategy of ruling the country according to law and building a state with legal system .  All this is in the final analysis aimed at fundamentally and continually improving the state of human rights in China .  
However , Tien Hung-mao was unwilling to reconfirm Li Hsien-jen 's statements .  He stressed : Li Hsien-jen , as a convenor of the Foreign Affairs Committee , should be aware of the contents of such highly sensitive political statements .  Deputy Minister David Ta Wei Lee [ Li Ta-wei ] also pointed out on 18 December : Previously , because of their status in the opposition party , Bush 's personal aides who make decisions on foreign policies had opportunities to visit Taiwan and held talks with our government officials .  
Those attending the forum promised to thoroughly study and implementthe guideline laid down by the National United Front Work Conference , and bring intofull play their own strong points in close connection with their own characteristics.They also pledged to energetically conduct economic , political , and cultural affairs for building socialism with Chinese characteristics and maintain a political situation characterized by stability and unity .  They also promised to serve the complete reunification of the motherland , maintain world peace , and promote common development .  
We have to make the opening of administrative affairs an important content of the party leading cadre annual work exam and responsible system of the honest political structure of the party discipline , and use the results of the exam as the important fundamental of punishing and rewarding the cadres .  
IV . To continue to strengthen bilateral cooperation and coordination at the United Nations , ASEAN Regional Forum , East Asia Cooperation , APEC , ASEM and other international and regional multilateral fronts and promote the solidarity and cooperation of the developing countries .  To continue to work for the establishment of a just and rational new international political and economic order and make new contributions to the maintenance of peace , stability and development in the region and the world at large .  
" We must fully understand the characteristic of Xinjiang 's anti-splittist struggle that it is protracted , acute and complex , unswervingly and firmly foster the idea that stability overrides everything , strengthen our sense of political responsibility in safeguarding Xinjiang 's stability , and stand on the forefront of the struggle consciously and on our own initiative to resolutely wage an uncompromising struggle against national splittism . "  
However , Lin Zhongbing , who is familiar with the political situation of US , China , and Taiwan , thinks that , " I am afraid that if we have expectations that are too high , or we look forward to a dramatic change of our already decided policy of the realm of our foreign affairs international activities , it would be unrealistic . "  
It has been disclosed that the leaders of the Central Organization Department went in person to Shenyang and Dalian the other day to notify the leading bodies of Liaoning Province and Dalian City . People in the local political arena generally believe that a circular about the relevant appointments and dismissals will be transmitted and made public to lower levels .  
is a central link that unites the whole party and people of all ethnic groups of the entire country in their fulfillment of all the tasks set by the party and the state ; and is also a major political advantage enjoyed by our party and our socialist country .  Only when we give full play to the ideological-political work , which is our political advantage , can we ensure that our economic work as well as work in other fields can develop towards a correct direction ;  
can we ensure that the party 's line , principles , and policies can be put into effect in every aspect of our work and among the masses ; can we promptly eliminate and overcome the disturbances of erroneous stuffs of various kinds ; and can we consolidate and develop the ideological and political foundation for the common struggle that are currently carried out by the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can we subsequently provide a strong driving power and a powerful guarantee for our economic work as well as work in other fields .  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;  
Implementing the strategy of developing west China and speeding up the development of central and west China is an important component of China 's modernization strategy .  A major decision by the CPC Central Committee , it shows great foresight , is oriented toward the new century , and takes the entire situation into consideration .  It has the most profound economic and political significance .  
He said , China and Russia have engaged in highly successful cooperation on a whole series of major international and regional issues such as the ABM issue , arms control , regional security , and in advocating world multipolarization , and this has played a positive role in opposing hegemonism and power politics and pushing the establishment of a new international political and economic order .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
Zeng : The implementation of the large-scale western development strategy to accelerate the development in the central and western regions is a major policy decision made by the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core as it looked far ahead from a high plane , took the entire situation into consideration , and oriented the development toward the 21st century , which is of momentous economic and political significance .  
They expressed that in the new century they will fully exercise the role of the democratic parties in participating in political affairs , positively participate in the administration and discussion of the state affairs , strengthen democratic supervision , make efforts to offer advice and make suggestions , further intensify their self-construction , and work hard to build the democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce into high-quality parties participating in political affairs and an important mass organization of the united front suited to the requirements of the 21st century .  
As a modern mass media , broadcasting has its unique advantage , as it spreads quickly , is convenient to listen in , and has a wide coverage and a strong appeal .  It has an important influence in our economic , political , scientific and technological , educational and cultural life .  
I hope that you would treasure your duty and mission , cultivate a strong enterprising spirit and sense of responsibility , and devote your thoughts and energies to the successful running of the broadcasting industry .  You should learn , learn and learn again , penetrate , penetrate and penetrate still deeper .  You should draw wisdom and nourishments from the fervent activities of reform and construction and from the practice of the masses in creating a beautiful future in order to improve your political quality , spiritual outlook and vocational level .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : In the 21st century , China will continue to resolutely and unwaveringly uphold the reform and opening-up policy and pursue an independent foreign policy of peace .  China will actively develop friendly and cooperative ties with all other countries , based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and strive to establish an equitable and rational world order in the political and economic arenas .  
As for the purchase of submarines from the United States , a naval officer indicated that , if the United States reopens its closed production lines to produce submarines powered by conventional diesel engines , the costs of the submarines [ that Taiwan intended to buy ] would be substantially higher .  He said political factors are also important issues the United States has to consider before it decides whether to sell submarines to Taiwan . He said in the future the United States might assist Taiwan to build its own submarines by providing Taiwan with technical support .  
The two sides stressed that the friendly cooperative treaty should be based on safeguarding the security and interests of the two countries and their peoples , and that the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership should be substantiated on the political , economic , and military fronts . 
Jiang Zemin spoke highly on the phone of Russia 's rapid economic development , political stability and positive role in international affairs under Putin 's leadership , while Putin expressed his support for the three major tasks outlined in Jiang Zemin 's New Year 's message . 
It is readily apparent that the new " cross-strait " structure of " eternal peace " and " political union " that the Taiwanese leader calls for is a " security structure " with a guaranteed " independent standing . "  Under an international strategic position , foreign powers would use this structure to " contain ( China 's ) surroundings " and extend Taiwan a protective umbrella .  
They colluded with Huang Guolin , a dismissed worker of customs , smuggled goods valued at more than $ 88 million , and evaded a tax worth more than 17.6 million yuan .  The judgement was : Fu Zhijian and Huang Guolin committed a crime of smuggling ordinary goods ; they were sentenced to death , and deprived of political rights for life , with their personal property confiscated and turned over to the national treasury .  
The Hong Kong people have really valued " one country , two systems " since the reversion , much more the stable social environment and recovering and developing economy at present , and are firmly opposed to all [ attempts ] to use the Hong Kong SAR to carry out political activities detrimental to the country and " one country , two systems " and harmful to Hong Kong 's stability and prosperity .  
Public security organs at all levels should conscientiously enhance their sense of political responsibility and , with the spirit of being highly responsible for the party , people , and law , make further efforts to unify their ideas , inspire themselves with enthusiasm , adopt stronger measures , strike out with a powerful force , and firmly crack down on triads and evil forces to enable the people to enjoy a safe , happy , and peaceful Spring Festival and lay a good foundation for the work of public order in the whole year .  
The local authorities have made great efforts to thoroughly expose the true features of the Falungong cult and the sinister political schemes of Li Hongzhi , popularize scientific and cultural knowledge as well as legal knowledge , and increase the ability of the masses to recognize and stay immune from the cult .  
Through patient , meticulous and earnest ideological and political work over the past year and more , the overwhelming majority of Falungong followers have come to recognize Li Hongzhi 's true features , left the Falungong of their own accord and returned to their normal work , study and life .  
We must not be faint-hearted and hesitant in dealing with the handful of criminals who , with ulterior political motives , held fast to their anti-government , anti-social and anti-people stand , and organized and instigated deceived Falungong maniacs to openly stir up trouble , disrupt public order , and undermine social stability in their attempt to undermine the cause of socialist modernization .  We must deal a resolute blow to them and punish them severely in accordance with law , and must not leave any openings for future trouble .  
Toward Li Hongzhi and his followers who stayed behind the scene , fled overseas and surrendered to anti-China forces of the west , we must continue to expose and criticize them , expose their sinister political schemes and ugly cult nature to the light of day , create an ambiance of social justice , where they are chased by all like rats scurrying across the street , and thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence and social foundation of the Falungong .  
Such perverse acts have led to Taiwan 's turbulent political situation , sluggish economy , tumbling stock prices , and unstable popular feelings .  As a result , not only is the political deadlock between the two sides of the strait unable to be broken , but some factors of uncertainty keeps on increasing .  
Strengthened and expanded bilateral cooperation and enhanced understanding , together with mutual trust and support , will be conducive to the two countries in playing their important roles in the establishment of a new political and economic order in the world .  
Since the US economy has grown strongly in recent years , its military strength far outstrips anyone else , and it controls international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Bank , many in political and academic circles have become dizzy and declared that the US pursuit of world " unipolarization " is historically inevitable .  
Cohen , a political figure who has published many poetry books , mentioned that he said on the Shanghai Stock Exchange that as the middle class on the Chinese mainland grows , their middle class will do " what every middle class has done throughout history " : it will seek a greater voice in governing , it will suggest new and creative approaches to national challenges , and it will push for peaceful solutions to international disputes and stable commerce with its neighbors .  
The military made numerous fruitful results in ideological and political building , started sci-tech training , steadily promoted logistical reform , markedly improved armaments , and continued to raise the overall combat effectiveness .  
China attaches great importance to strengthening friendly cooperation with Syria in various fields , and is willing to work together with Syria to consolidate the political basis for mutual trust and cooperation , to develop mutually beneficial trade and economic relations , to strengthen coordination and support in international affairs , and to jointly develop long-term , stable , sincere and friendly relations of mutually beneficial cooperation geared to the new century between the two countries .  
Xiang Huaicheng said that compared with other constantly developing regional cooperation organization , especially the European economic and monetary union , differences between Asian countries still exist in terms of history , culture , political system , and the level of economic development , and diversification is an conspicuous problem .  This determines that East Asia cooperation is a long-term arduous task .  It is necessary to choose the way and road for cooperation in light of its own characteristics , and the mode of development of other regional cooperation organizations should not be copied mechanically .  
We , Chinese journalists , will , as usual , work together with our counterparts in all countries of the world to make unswerving efforts for establishing a new international political and economic order of being peaceful , stable , fair , and reasonable and for promoting world peace and development .  
3 .  The faction that thinks it is impossible to maintain the status quo , but readjustment should be made gradually : Japan 's demand to become a political and military big country will become an irresistible trend in Japan 's political arena in the future .  The United States can only pay attention to the regional power structure and the popular will at home , and readjust bilateral relations step by step in accordance with such demand .  
continually and positively play a role at the non-governmental level ; further push forward political , economic , scientific , technological , cultural , education , sports , and personnel exchanges between our two countries and exchanges or cooperation between our local governments in all fields .  The people of our two countries should push in an all-round way friendship between China and Japan onto a new stage .  
As extensive contacts and in-depth discussions have resulted in deeper understanding and mutual trust , China and India have come up with a consensus on a wide range of issues , including bilateral relations , international issues , political , economic , cultural , scientific , or technological exchanges , exchanges between governments or parliaments , exchanges between political parties and peoples , border issues , good-neighborhood , and so on .  
In his address at the meeting , Vice Chairman Cheng Siwei said : On the whole , the current international situation is easing , the trend of world political multi-polarization and economic globalization is continuing to develop , and modern science and technology with information technology and life science as the core is developing by leaps and bounds .  Mankind is facing a rare development opportunity as well as a formidable challenge .  
The Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum was founded in Tokyo in January 1993 .  The purpose of the forum is to provide an opportunity for parliamentarians of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to discuss issues of common concern , and put forward suggestions on international affairs , in order to deepen their understanding of the region 's political , economic , social , and cultural situations .  
The two important documents approved by the meeting , the " Beijing Manifesto " and the " Outline for Sino-African Economic and Social Development , " comprehensively expounded the common ideas of China and Africa regarding major international issues such as establishing a new international political and economic order , determined that China and Africa will build an enduringly stable new-style strategic partnership of equality and mutual benefit , and also set down new lines of thought for Sino-African cooperation in substantive fields such as economics and trade .  
He stressed that China always maintains that the remaining issues of the Gulf War should be solved justly and reasonably on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council , and urges that the relevant parties should , proceeding from safeguarding sustainable peace , stability and development , demonstrate political goodwill and adopt a flexible and pragmatic attitude in order to create favorable conditions for an early settlement of the issues left from the Gulf War .  
Ever since President Museveni assumed office in 1986 , in particular , greater headway has been registered in the development of friendly relations of cooperation between our two countries ; and our cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , and other fields have yielded fruitful results .  
Now , Chen Shui-bian has made the three-step proposal of " from economic and trade integration to cultural integration and further to political integration " which sublates the bipolar thinking between reunification and independence and attempts to lay a foundation of mutual-benefit for cross-strait relations and build a new framework of interaction for long-term peace .  This is a pragmatic thinking conducive to maintaining stability on the Taiwan Straits .  
The two governments and the two peoples always respect each other , understand each other , and support each other .  Cooperation between the two sides in the political , economic , public health , cultural , educational , and other fields has been continuously expanding .  In particular , high-level visits were exchanged more frequently between the two countries , and bilateral exchanges increased .  
At this time when the entire nation is making unremitting efforts to realize the " 10th Five Year " plan , the heretical " Falungong " organization has stirred up trouble again and again , wreaked social havoc , interfered with the normal lives of the masses , and acted as an anti-China tool of hostile Western powers .  This has thoroughly exposed the sinister political motives of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " and made clear that to achieve complete victory in the struggle still requires our continued efforts .  
The ulterior motive of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult in spreading rumors to confuse the public , breaking the law and creating trouble is to create chaos and social disorder in China , disrupt people 's normal work , study and daily life , and interfere with the central task of economic development , so that they can realize their political aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Chinese communist party and changing China 's socialist system .  
He stressed the need to further promote the development of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges , promote the realization of direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait at an earlier date , and the need to seriously listen to the voice of Taiwan compatriots , increase exchanges with all political parties , organizations , and people in Taiwan who oppose division and support national reunification , and jointly make efforts to promote the development of cross-strait relations and realize the motherland 's complete reunification .  
Finally , Ji Peiding said : All the countries visited by Vice President Hu in this trip are developing countries .  Thus , the visit played an important role and produced a far-reaching impact on strengthening our country 's unity and cooperation with developing countries , promoting the process of establishing a new international political and economic order of being fair and reasonable , and promoting the comprehensive development of China 's friendly and cooperative relations with these five countries in the 21st century .  
On the UN peace-keeping operations , Tang Jiaxuan emphasized : The UN reforms regarding the aspect of peace-keeping operations should be favorable for promoting the political resolutions of disputes and conflicts .  All those basic principles which have been proven effective through practice should not be neglected .  The UN Security Council should play a leading role in this regard .  
He fully affirmed the corps ' work , saying : A while ago , the " Falungong " heretical organization continued to gather people to make troubles .  The people 's police officers and men of this corps firmly held to their sense of having a high degree of political responsibility and sensitivity , struggled persistently and unyieldingly , and determinedly smashed the heretical organization 's attempts to create troubles on various occasions making use of major events and important festivals , making outstanding contributions to ensuring the capital 's social and political stability .  
They held that the year 2000 which just passed was a year of landmark significance in the process of development in our country , as the national economy maintained a rather rapid development speed , the building of democratic politics made steady progress , the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system was further improved , and favorable conditions were created for us to comprehensively build our country into comparatively well-off society and speed up the process of socialist modernization in the new century .  
In their speeches , they also put forward opinions and proposals on how to better maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , further deepen reforms , promote sustained economic development , safeguard the political situation of stability and unity , enhance socialist democracy and the building of the legal system , and advance the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the new year .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
Let us closely rally around the CPC central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , keep firm confidence , get united and work cooperatively with one heart and one mind , continue to maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , consolidate and strengthen the most extensive patriotic united front , and join hands in striving for the realization of the grand objectives and the fulfillment of the three major tasks in the new century .  
Wan added that he was glad to see some Taiwan political parties and organizations visited and established ties with the mainland one after another ; industrial and commercial enterprises successively broke the restriction of " no haste , be patient " and made investments in the mainland ; there are mounting calls in Taiwan for direct " three links " ; and the anti - " independence " and pro-reunification forces have been growing .  The motherland 's reunification has become the focus of attention of the Chinese from around the world .  
He has even advocated the " two-state theory " in disguised form .  This has not only made cross-strait relations more complicated and perilous , but also created chaotic political and economic situations on the island , thereby thwarting the aspirations of the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots for peace , stability , and development .  These perverse acts have met with hard blows given by Chinese at home and abroad , including alumni of Huangpu Military Academy .  
On the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , we will further develop ties of friendship and cooperation with countries around the world , actively push forward the process of world multipolarization , make efforts to play our proper role in international affairs , and make new contributions to establishing a fair and rational new international political and economic order , preserving world peace , and promoting common development .  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
Li Hongzhi , however , who has thrown in his lot with western anti-China forces , has refused to give up his evil designs ; he has repeatedly disseminated his fallacies of " ascend to heaven on consummation , " " go beyond forbearance , " and " cause blood to flow , " and hoodwinked and incited " Falungong " diehards who are mentally controlled by him to make a reckless move , not even stinting to being content that " Falungong " addicts should die in order to reach his unspeakable political goals .  
As for those cadres who have a poor ideological and political quality , especially those who are found to have abused power for personal gains and have failed to remain honest in performing their official duties , we must firmly refuse to use them .  
The CYL organizations at all levels should be fully aware that opposing " Falungong " is a long-term , intense , and complicated struggle , which is also , in essence , a serious political struggle ; should extensively mobilize or unite the broad masses of the CYL members or youth to wage a firm and thorough struggle against " Falungong , " which is an evil cult ; should play a role as a vital new force in a struggle aimed at exposing or repudiating " Falungong " as an evil cult ;  
He pointed out : Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " evil cult have become a political tool of the Western anti-China forces .  To achieve their sinister political purpose , they spread fallacies to hoodwink the public again and again , instigated diehard " Falungong " members to incite mob disturbances again and again .  Now , they even took more desperate actions and went as far as driving obsessed followers to commit suicide .  
People must be clearly aware of the sinister and malicious attempt of the evil cult .  Luo Haocai stressed : The horrifying suicide incident once again showed that our struggle against the " Falungong " evil cult is a round of serious political struggle , and we must fully realize that the struggle will last over a long time and is arduous and complicated .

A total of 3,002 open-air rallies , arranged by the government for candidates to state their opinions publicly , were attended by thousands of voters , who showed particular interest in political affairs and local administration .  
This sums up events in the past century when millions of Chinese suffered under the experiments of various political systems , including constitutional monarchy , socialism and Communism . During the past 30 years , detente and power politics have dominated the world arena . As a result , justice , truth and moral courage have been obscured , and adverse tides have continued to buffet the nation . With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
He further remarked that the Chinese people place equal emphasis on human nature , reasonableness and law . The work of the mediation council is based on the first two considerations , and the agreements it makes possible must have legal standing . Mayor Lee said that the function of mediation councils is a unique feature in the nation 's political history . He is convinced that once the mediation council fully develops its role , people will no longer need to go to the courts to settle their disputes .  
Doctors rarely engage in basic research work , it was pointed out . Furthermore , while there is a great deal of advanced technological equipment , there is a lack of people qualified to use it . The Republic of China 's standing in medical organizations was threatened a few years ago by political factors .  
According to statistics which appeared in a local paper , major political issues raised by candidates were the upgrading of the livelihood of farmers ; promotion of administrative reform ; raising of salaries of government officials , public functionaries and teachers ; increasing social welfare ; building more residential districts ; increasing benefits to workers ; improving traffic conditions ; providing better flood control measures ; and working generally for the good of the people .  
Tainan can not compare with Taipei as a political and economic center , and has little chance to catch up with Kaohsiung 's industrial development . But Mayor Su intends to restore Tainan 's faded glory . " We hope to create a city that is both comfortable to live in and enjoyable to visit , " he says .  
At that time the social order was stable the economy was thriving and the suburbs of Changan and Loyang were thickly populated . The capital , Changan , was the political , economic , and cultural center of Asia .  
These character inscriptions provide valuable information as to the life during this early period of Chinese history . The late years of the Chou marked the beginning of a long period of political instability throughout north and east China . This period which is recorded in the classic annals of " the Spring and Autumn " ( 722-484 BC ) saw China divided up into rival kingdoms , each with their own written language .  
From then until the late nineteenth century , Tainan served as the political , cultural and economic center of Taiwan . Its rich history has left Tainan with a heritage of cultural landmarks and scholarly contributions unmatched elsewhere on the island .  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics . This , together with other changing objective conditions , has made ' lifting martial law ' and ' opening up the formation of new political parties ' a natural decision , " says government spokesman Chang King-yuh .  
One newspaper editorial has commented that Yu has been both unfortunate and fortunate to have served for these last three turbulent years . On the one hand , the pace of political , economic , and social change has been extremely rapid , even chaotic .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
A democratic government has been the goal which China has been long searching for in recent years , but after the Chinese Communists ' abrupt rise , the value of this democratic theory which is applicable everywhere has been muddled and its role confused under the fighting among the political parties of China .  
Now Taiwan is in a period of intense change ; the economy is thriving and " political fever " is common . Each is centered on its own development . Each has its heroes . In a modern society where we are particular about equal development , this is something rather dangerous .  
During his eight years at Chinese opera school , Ma threw himself with total energy into mastering the techniques of this demanding art , and he became an instant stage success after his graduation in 1959 . Unfortunately , in the political context of the time , his aristocratic family background proved to be a major stumbling block in his artistic career .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
So starting from the present , the party should expand the channels for participation and communication , so that party members and cadres have ample opportunity to express their opinions . A view of the current political situation reveals ever-changing and treacherous trends and widespread military conflict . The antagonism between the two extremes of freedom and slavery as well as of democracy and totalitarianism has never let up in the least .  
This so-called " domain of single subjectivity " refers to the main characteristic that in traditional Chinese history social , economic , academic , cultural , and artistic activities as subjectivities were deeply influenced by political activity as subjectivity .  
Most of the changes are clearly positive ; however , some have caused us to take a second look at where we are going . Our government and people are now in the position of having to come up with quick answers to a wide range of new and challenging questions . Unlike many nations of the West that have had well over a century to gradually adjust to political and economic modernization , the Republic of China is having to compact this development into the short span of a few decades .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University . When official astronomers witnessed an unusual celestial event , they would attach some forced political meaning to it , and rarely explored for the objective truth .  
Two centuries of adaptation and hard work combined with changing political and economic factors have made " the smooth integration of the Chinese into the multicultural society of Hawaii one of the rare success stories in the history of world immigration , " as Professor Clarence E . Glick of the University of Hawaii , noted for his research on the subject , has put it .  
Although fiercely competitive , this channel of selection and replacement assists in social integration . ( 2 ) A gradual increase in the average level of education and expertise of elected officials has helped increase the efficiency and capability of the political system . ( 3 ) Native Taiwanese have a comparatively better chance of serving in public office through elections , while mainlanders often pass through other recruitment channels .  
Wang served with Yin Chung-jung , K . T . Li , Chao Yao-tung , and other famous leading figures in the world of economics and finance . He can rely on a rich background and thirty years ' training at mediating views to handle the coordination and communications among the various economic and financial ministries . This will enable Premier Lee to focus on mapping out the nation 's political and economic future .  
However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
Steadily Advancing Our Mainland Work " Building up Taiwan to recover the mainland " is a fundamental government policy . With the chief goals of our political call to the mainland being democracy , freedom , unification , and prosperity for all , we must advance our work in a steady , active , and positive manner while paying heed at all times to the political , economic , and social situation .  
If both the government and the people adhere to the established policies of political democratization , economic liberalization , societal pluralization , and cultural sinification ; if they speed the development of democratic politics and maintain stable economic growth ; and if they progress in related social and cultural respects - - all this will mean that all sectors in our nation will develop in a balanced way and forge ahead jointly .  
Under political party competition , society has the right to ask that the parties and the candidates they put forward have a high degree of ' political responsibility ' and meet the competitive ethics of party politics , " says Kao Hui-yu , a reporter for the United Daily News . Similarly , candidates need to promote a sense of public responsibility in order to change voters ' thinking from passive mobilization into active participation .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
Fellow Countrymen , Distinguished Guests : Over two thousand years ago , Chinese culture gave birth to the ideal of a great world commonwealth of peace and prosperity . The political , economic , and social systems and goals that it entails are in full accord with those implemented and sought by modern free and democratic nations .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .  
Although mainland China 's initial responses are far from friendly , you still keep calling on them to make a rational choice . I think the people are most concerned with the question of when conditions may become ripe . What I mean is that given your understanding and knowledge of the world situation and the political developments in mainland China , when do you think conditions will become ripe for talks between the two sides as equals ? Thank you , Mr . President .  
Several of the most popular areas of research , such as the encroachment of Western imperialism on China , Christianity in China , Chinese political philosophy and the spread of education were all aimed at gaining a quick understanding of modern China , and areas not related to contemporary China were neglected .  
According to research by Hsia Li-ming associate professor at Taitung Normal College , there is a marked difference between Chinese imperial maps , produced to meet the political and military requirements of the court , and European navigation charts of the same period , where the commercial interest is foremost .  
Their letter was earnest . The gist of it was that they felt close to the characters in my books and very much wanted to talk with me . . . . There was only a scattering of overseas Chinese in Europe 27 or 28 years ago , and the term " overseas Chinese community " was practically unheard of . As few as we were , under the shadow of the political climate of the time , we fell into two clearly defined camps , the line crossed only by a handful .  
Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
Nevertheless , since ancient times major affairs of state have been seen as the center of political activity , and are what most people think of when they think of ' politics , ' " says Yeh . This is a distortion of a paternalistic society - - promoting invasiveness , and lacking in acceptance and tolerance - - which defined the political core , but it is by no means the only or normal nature of politics .  
Then there are those harshly judgmental types in " little theater " who feel the groups like Ping-Fong Acting Troupe and the Performance Workshop are practically commercial in nature and that they make use of superficial political clich ? s and catchwords to create an " overripe , saturated urban space " that 's pretty to look at and easy to digest but lacking in substance .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
Feeling illegal : There are more mainland spouses here illegally who have n't been exposed by the media . Some of them may have married because they longed for Taiwan 's political and economic stability or wanted to live here and could n't find a job back home or even because they fell into clutches of the white slave trade .  
In our original conception , there would be nine items for evaluation - - those being , besides the eight main powers of legislators , also adding one item for " constituent service . " There are four criteria for evaluation - - whether the legislator effectively promotes a balance with the executive ; whether the legislator 's attitude in interpellations is reasonable ; the extent to which expressed political views are realized in practice ; and whether or not the legislator follows the constitution . ( However , we do n't include ideology . )  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
When , in 1989 , the Chinese Communists committed the horrendous atrocity of the Tienanmen massacre in full view of the world 's media , Western governments were finally roused from their dreaming . The last threads of the illusion they had built up concerning the movement of China 's communist authorities towards democracy were broken . In stark contrast , the liberalization and process of political normalization on this side of the Taiwan Strait led the West to begin to accept the ROC as a member of the democratic camp . "  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
The road is named after the Chinese hero Tran Hung-dao , who led the Vietnamese in resistance against the invading Mongol armies of the Yuan dynasty in the fourteenth century . To the east of the road is the Vietnamese political and economic center ( now the first and third districts ) , while to the west is Tan An ( the fifth and sixth districts ) .  
Especially in 1981 , just three years after the United States broke off diplomatic relations , and with a sensitive atmosphere still lingering two years after the riots of the Kao-hsiung Incident . Although her parents had never filled her with any kind of political consciousness , Hsin Chi-ming had still , from a young age , got a fuzzy stereotyped idea that anyone who had anything to do with the 228 Incident was a thoroughly bad person , so you can imagine how she panicked .  
The memoir 's depiction of the events of the Cultural Revolution , however , does convince a reader that the deliberate selfishness of leaders , combined with the wrong political system , allowed the evil and selfish in people to run wild . Only people of excellent character could lend a helping hand or show a little gentleness .  
Q : Because the Three Gorges project is extremely complex , there are many different opinions pro and con . Those opposed accuse the political leaders of simply liking grandiose white elephants while ignoring the ecology and the overall interests of the nation . Those who approve say that the dam could resolve the eternal problem of flooding on the Yangtze , and feel that this enormous project would enable the country to become wealthy and strong , creating a chance to do something unparalleled in the world .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
By the same token , those people who hope that the government can start political discussions on this subject with the Chinese Communists as soon as possible are apt to be accused of demeaning themselves and strengthening the enemy 's hand , while those who propose ignoring the Chinese Communists and appealing directly for international support are accused of wishful thinking and blindness to reality , or of opportunistically seeking Taiwanese independence . . . .  
With the recent rapid economic growth in Taiwan , political liberalization , and a successful switch to a more practical approach to foreign policy , the ROC 's international status has risen , and some of the reasons used in the past for obtaining foreign passports no longer exist .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
Apart from distributing handbills covered densely with printed or brush-written characters explaining their views , they also made effective use of mobile advertisements in the form of vehicles plastered with posters . Kuo Kuo-chi has been active in politics since shortly after Taiwan returned from Japanese to Chinese rule , and was one of the " Five Tiger Generals " of the early years of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly . His quick reactions and hard-hitting style earned him the epithet " Cannon Kuo " in political circles and the media .  
In the 1983 elections to expand the Legislative Yuan , the Taipei branch of the KMT broke away from the former stereotyped dogmatic approach , and for the first time used the techniques of commercial advertising to present a packaged image in straightforward , accessible language . This also marked the first time that a commercial advertising agency was brought across the divide into political advertising .  
In terms of election demands , as the climate grew more open opinions of every political color were aired , and later the same year the DPP 's central standing committee passed its " Draft Constitution for Taiwan , " and proposed " founding an independent country . " The KMT , seizing on Taiwan 's middle classes ' collective fear of disorder and desire for stability , defined its position as one of " renewal , stability and prosperity , " while lambasting the DPP as the party of " violence and revolution . "  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
Turning to look at Chinese people 's inherited political mindset , there is implicit in it a " tacit spirit of harmonious coexistence . " This is reflected in the allocation of political representatives to each ethnic group , whereby harmonious coexistence and equal representation of the Chinese nation 's " five peoples " is striven for .  
God 's Dice collects eight of Kuo Cheng 's recent stories together . Material ranges from the middle-class escapist rhapsody of " God 's Dice , " the hell bent for leather adolescent days of " Flying Sword , " and the sordid circus antics of the political arena in " Put on a White Face , " to the driven historical mission of " The Last Proclamation " and the deranged baby killing of " How to Execute an Infant . "  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
This combination of Sun 's own words with journalistic evidence to provide both subjective and objective views was extremely well received . But in fact there are very few examples of objectively critical authorized biographies of " big league " politicians . Most authors wishing to write about political figures adopt the second-best approach of collecting material indirectly in a round-about " covert operation . "  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .  
True , in The End of the Century she still shows an intellectual 's contemplative acuity , but is that gentle and kind glowing mother of Children the same woman who wrote Wild Fire , a collection of critical political and social writings , ten years ago ?  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
Making a choice for the childQ : After Chi An became pregnant with her second child in the United States , she was unwilling to have an abortion there , and she was afraid that when she returned to mainland China she would be forced to abort . With your help , she received political asylum and stayed in the US . In fact , she never incurred any direct oppression . Why was her application successful ?  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
When he hears talk about the elements now making up the temple milieu he perks up and begins pointing all around , explaining this and that in an amiable and composed way . He points out that the courtyard outside the threshold is a " political zone . " The walkways - - which in a Chinese temple are covered and skirt the outside of the main courtyard - - are occupied by little groups of fortune-tellers , devout Buddhists , and elderly men , each conversing on their own themes .  
Although both have reasons for their beliefs , comparatively speaking the mainland 's syllabuses and textbooks contain much more of the ideology of the Communist Party and of socialism , " making it explicit that education must serve politics , " says Huang Cheng-chieh . In his view , Taiwan 's syllabuses also incorporate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People , but it is expressed in " vague and abstract terms , in the hope that it can be acceptable to everyone , and not serve a minority of political parties or interest groups . "  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
But because it was a dark era , when society was riven by sharp political differences , he adopted a muddled demeanor . When others spoke to him about some matter - - whether they described something joyous or tragic , or offered an opinion he shared or opposed - - Sima would always say , " Good . "  
Nevertheless , according to Chang Le-chi 's description , NGOs always want to keep their image of " being afraid of becoming politically sullied . " They stand somewhat aloof from authorities . They even purposefully maintain a safe distance from political figures with similar ideas , and they forbid currently unployed essential staff from running for public office , to prevent opportunists from turning social activism into a springboard for amassing personal political resources . "  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
However , from the 17th century onwards , wave after wave of immigrants flooded onto this peaceful , happy land through the harbor at Tainan , encroaching on the Sirayas ' living space . Those Siraya who did not retreat further and further south or into the mountains accepted the rule of the incoming political authority and were subsequently assimilated .  
Increasingly frequent interaction between mainland China and Taiwan , their respective political climates , and the new world order taking shape in the post-Cold-War era are of course important historical backdrops , but the ominous tone of the book 's title , and related historical events which the author used as examples , were factors leading to the sensation surrounding T-Day Many people who had never even read the book joined in the debate , some were even frightened to the point of making preparations to emigrate .  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent . According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss . With little international room to maneuver following the ROC 's withdrawal from the United Nations , Taiwan 's only asset was economic growth .  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives . These books drive home the importance of the women 's and Taiwan autonomy movements , so as to prevent society here from regressing as a result of political troubles .  
I am convinced that only when upright , insightful , capable and experienced people , regardless of their political affiliation or social group , participate in the leadership of the government will political stability and national growth be ensured .  
During the years of the preposterous and unprecedented Cultural Revolution , I finally realized that the difference between Mao Zedong and Karl Marx was that Mao extended the scope of the powerful machinery of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the political and economic sphere into the domain of the human mind .  
When mainland China 's band of political fraudsters raised high the red banner of " total dictatorship , " the minds of countless intellectuals groaned in the most abject despair in the dark corners of the " cowsheds " and prisons .  
At that time I was still young , and I escaped the dreadful fate of many old scholars and authors . Like countless millions of my compatriots I merely injected my spirited youthful emotions to that unique system of thought , and became part of a unified political machine , making my mind utter unfeeling cries .  
With reform and liberalization , China at the end of the 20th century is growing more prosperous by the day . But despite Beijing 's promises of " one country , two systems , " and " self-rule for Hong Kong " guaranteed by Hong Kong 's Basic Law , as long as the basic nature of the totalitarian communist regime has not changed and the political straitjacket has not been loosened , does Hong Kong really have nothing to fear ?  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Quite the opposite from what outsiders suspected , the principal reason for prolonging talks was in fact claims of " unfair commercial advantages . " The seemingly sensitive questions of sovereignty and political rivalry were actually secondary .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
After intensive discussion , the three parties finally agreed that the compromises achieved before the conference should not be lightly abandoned . Besides retaining the definition of the two sides of the Strait as " equal political entities , " the conference simply added proposals by Ju Gau-jeng for a " cross-strait forum " and " inviting representative persons from both sides of the Strait to participate as private individuals to peacefully resolve cross-strait issues through an exchange of opinions without any non-negotiable positions . "  
Ending class struggle gave people a breathing spell . And , in a decisive fashion , Deng removed the many labels - " landlord , " " bourgeois , " " counter-revolutionary , " " bad element , " " rightist , " and so on-from the many people erroneously branded in the many political movements of the past .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music . " In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
Today the free political environment , developed economy and diversified society in Hong Kong and Taiwan have allowed the media to break free from the shackles of the traditional strict authoritarian order and nurture a free and independent press .  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
Another judge , Huang Hai-ming , adds that the five artists selected reveal three cultural phenomena : the prospering global economy and information explosion that brought with them the crises of spiritual fragmentation and loss of self-identity ( Wang Jun-jieh ) , political and social criticism that followed the lifting of martial law ( Wu Tien-chang and Yao Jui-chung ) , and finally " a return to the feelings of the heart and the oriental tradition " ( Lee Ming-tse and Chen Chien-pei ) .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
The Western powers were at the time entering a depression and had no energy to interfere in the affairs of the East . Secondly , blockading of the Communists was underway in Jiangxi . The Nanjing-Guangdong split had occurred , when leading military and political figures established an alternative government after the arrest of Hu Hanmin . The Yangtze also flooded with calamitous consequences , leaving millions of people dead or dislocated .  
As the president 's official photographer , Kao 's choice of angle when photographing him was tempered by the desire to maintain the national leader 's dignity . The pictures which political photojournalists love to take of politicians distressed or dispirited , yawning or picking their noses , are nowhere to be seen in Kao 's archives . " What 's the point of taking those ? When I did happen to get shots like that , I destroyed them , " says Kao .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
The ROC government had been established on Taiwan for 20 years and the fruits of land reform had provided a basis for the greater prosperity of the common people . Economic activity , primarily from public investment , was flourishing . However , the island was still under martial law , political prohibitions such as those outlawing the establishment of political parties had not yet been repealed , and the social atmosphere was tense .  
Jan Jyh-horng responded that although Taipei has never sought to avoid political negotiations aimed at eventual reunification , both Beijing and Taipei would first have to approach such negotiations with a common understanding that " the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled by separate and equal entities . "  
Recently , at the invitation of Taipei City Government , Morris Chang , chairman of the powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) , delivered a lecture entitled " New Recruits for the 21st Century . " The specification he described for modern employees included these requirements : The ability to actively participate in political and social work ; an international perspective ; taking pleasure in cooperative endeavor ; a good general understanding of science and technology ; and the ability to think independently . Finally , they should be " specialized all-rounders . "  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
Later , in Singapore , Chiu and Tang Shubei , vice chairman of ARATS , repeatedly emphasized the " four natures " of the Koo-Wang talks : non-governmental , economic , pragmatic , and functional . The two parties agreed to put aside relatively sensitive political issues that they disagreed on . Obviously these " four natures " referred not only to the Koo-Wang talks , but could also be seen as guiding principles for future handling of cross-strait relations by the associations .  
Mr . Koo did not avoid politically sensitive issues , clearly and unambiguously giving voice to the Republic of China 's political principles . And by avoiding the mainland 's trap , Mr . Koo expanded the scope of the dialogue to include the rights of the people and lured the mainland into agreeing to four points of consensus set by Taiwan . While working within the major differences outlined above , the two sides together sought out minor points to agree upon .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds . Behind this pattern was a tense military standoff with mainland China , which shelled the island of Kinmen heavily in 1958 . A number of projects designed to promote political stability and ensure economic and social survival and development were completed during these years .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
" People 's lives were wasted when they were imprisoned for many years here because of their beliefs and political views , " said Premier Vincent Siew , who spoke as master of ceremonies at the monument 's ground-breaking . " In truth , freedom of belief is a God-given right , and no one should be imprisoned for political reasons . " Past history shows us , Siew noted , that human wisdom is often distorted by mistaken judgment , with deep regrets later .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
Sung Ju-shan , a lecturer at Chinese Culture University , writes in her doctoral dissertation A Decade of Post-Cultural-Revolution Literature in Mainland China , " After shifting political circumstances debunked earlier values , the Red Guards who had devoted their youth to politics were faced with an urgent need to seek new meaning in life . "  
The initial enthusiastic response was overshadowed by the 1979 Formosa Incident in Kaohsiung , but as Taiwan 's rapid economic development in the 1980s swelled the ranks of the middle classes , all kinds of political and non-political social movements gathered strength , and organizations such as Chai Sung-lin 's Consumers ' Foundation and Li Yuan-chen 's Awakening Foundation came into being .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
Taiwan is blessed with a number of lavishly gifted film-makers who are committed to their ideals , but the solemnity of whose creations perhaps deters a movie-going public raised on Hollywood and Disney . Their films , however , help serious cinema-goers in Taiwan and around the world to better confront life , and at the same time win international exposure for Taiwan , enabling the island 's more cultured aspect to break through in the face of international political taboos and wrangling .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
" During this final transitional year , " comments an editorial in the China Times , " Lee Teng-hui must do three things : construct a new parliamentary system , complete the nomination of the Kuomintang 's presidential candidate and assist in the election , and achieve a transition in political power that maintains a stable social structure . "  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Hu Tsu-ching , an associate professor of political science at Soochow University , warns that there are several problems that must be addressed : The Kosovo government-in-exile is mired in internal strife , and it must be decided which " Kosovo " to assist . Ways must be found to ensure that the aid provides practical help to the refugees , and is not diverted into private pockets . With regard to the proposed training program in Taiwan , there are problems of language , health clearance , and so on .  
At a time when other groups have achieved heightened visibility and have succeeded in winning general acceptance of their need to preserve their rights , the Hakkas are still saddled with the same old stereotypes they 've always had to live with-invisible , docile , conservative , impassive . . . . Hakka activists have to take to the street to get their own people to adopt a bit of a higher profile . A quick glance at the ranks of society 's post-martial law political and business leaders is revealing .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
The political context has been democratized during the 50 years since the government moved to Taiwan , but much still needs to be done with regard to law and order . The economy may be flourishing , but in terms of environmental protection we completely fail to make the grade . Educational levels have jumped and society is buzzing with activity , yet some of the old qualities of generosity and forbearance have been sacrificed , and we are yet to attain the innate understanding and self-awareness of a mature society .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
" Formerly , Taiwan under its authoritarian political system never cultivated mechanisms to encourage autonomy . It lacked a civil society given to self-reflection . It was n't in the habit of discussing , deliberating and making judgments , and it lacked a concern for local affairs . " Ping Lu 's soft , moderate tone reveals an undercurrent of hurt .  
At the beginning of the 1980s the political atmosphere began to loosen up . In society , consumer , environmental , women 's , labor and other movements rose up one after another , and yet education , like an impregnable fortress , remained unchanged . Looking back today , it appears that just as the various social movements started to die down , the educational-reform movement-as if having a delayed reaction to the changing times-took off full steam .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum offered visitors a peek outside the mainstream in October , exhibiting a collection of works by contemporary artists from five Central American nations . Apart from the exotic nature of the exhibit , the deep insights that the artists have incorporated into these works offer a portrait of the political , economic , cultural , and social realities of Central America today .  
With wisdom and intelligence , the people of the Han institutionalized the country 's political , economic and social systems , laying down the framework for the subsequent development of Chinese society . By the time the second millennium arrived , it was the era of the ultra-refined Song dynasty . This was a period when individual freedoms were extended , encouraging one of the most remarkable flowerings of literature , fine art and handicrafts in history .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
Fortunately , in the years since the lifting of martial law , once-downtrodden ethnic groups have begun to gain political clout and a sense of self-determination . The view that aboriginal culture must be preserved has become " politically correct " and mainstream . But social benefits to the aborigines can not depend on some fuzzy sense of charity . The aborigines need more thoughtful and efficacious aid .  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
Huang Ming-chuan , who studied law before he began making movies , has come to be seen as the standard-bearer for independent films in Taiwan . Flat Tire , which he completed two years ago , tells the story of a pair of documentary makers traveling around Taiwan to film the island 's religious and political statuary . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
The " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff . The political warfare system ( an autonomous system of political commissar-type officers , created in early Republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders ) will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change .  
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions . It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
As Liu Shao-tang explained in Volume 64 , No . 2 : " From the struggle between Sun and Huang in the early years of the Republic , through the chaos of the warlord era and the North-South standoff , to the periods of cooperation and conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists , Yu witnessed countless political struggles . He saw how much historical data was distorted or destroyed , how right was turned into wrong and black into white , and how whoever won the battles also won history .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem .

As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . " Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high-technology , compassion , and peace . If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
Q : Taiwan firms have always been cooperative , and overseas investment has been very helpful to the ROC 's diplomatic work . But today the government is putting political considerations first in encouraging Taiwan firms to invest in friendly countries . From an economic point of view , how effective is this ?  
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
A number of Chinese authors have risen to fame in recent years with books published in English , including Nien Cheng , Amy Tan , Jung Chang , and Ha Jin . Now Adeline Yen Mah has joined the list with Falling Leaves : The True Story of an Unwanted Chinese Daughter . This autobiographical account focuses especially on the author 's childhood years growing up in a wealthy but abusive family in China during a time of political upheaval .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
On November 20 , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) marked its sixth month as the ruling party , but because of a long series of political disturbances during the last half year , the Chen administration 's attempt to run a " government of the whole people " crumbled , and instead it formed a minority government . Thus , the cabinet has consistently found itself a " new hand behind the wheel . " Major policies naturally have not been fully implemented , engendering an aura of dejection , and dour expectations for the economy .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
It 's fortunate , then , that the instructors at the leadership education camps put on in Taiwan this past year included figures beyond the usual line-up of political leaders featured at events sponsored by political parties . Some instructors at the camps were religious leaders and others were people making their marks in such areas as social welfare , community education or environmental protection .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
" It is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in the 20th century . Now it doubles once every three to five years , " notes Wu Se-hwa , dean of the business school at National Chengchi University . The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of the 20th century , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .  
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links . In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties . In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Not long afterwards , he was arrested by the Japanese military for a cartoon in a newspaper depicting a famous Chinese general from the Ming dynasty killing a " dwarf pirate . " ( " Dwarf pirate " has long been a derogatory term used by Chinese to refer to Japanese . ) He thereby became categorized as a " Chinese juvenile political criminal . "  
In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse . While the president in late May was traveling abroad and raising Taiwan 's international profile , bad news was breaking at home . The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
In 1996 , the ROC 's first direct presidential election marked the first time ever that Chinese people could select their own leader on a one-man , one-vote basis . But it was also when cross-strait relations reached their nadir , as the mainland undertook missile tests prior to the election , creating extreme tension . The resulting freeze in political relations created circumstances under which any national leader of Taiwan would have to make national security the top priority .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
With reference to the mainland 's ill-considered and arbitrary actions , some political commentators put forward the interpretation that with the Communist Party of China 's 16th national congress imminent and a new leadership line-up about to emerge , mainland politicians jostling for positions of power were eager to put on an impressive performance , so they adopted a more hawkish posture .  
In this crucial period of a strategic realignment of global political and economic forces , Taiwan needs to increase its opportunities for international exposure and actively participate in international activities , in order to make its voice heard . Only in this way can Taiwan truly manifest its national status and dignity .  
Her husband Li Chung-sheng , who was very accomplished at a wide range of Taiwanese Opera roles , died on stage when the gunpowder he was using for special stage effects accidentally exploded in his face . Sai herself later got into political hot water . Branded as a " capitalist roader , " she was thrown into jail for several months .  
In this showdown between political organizations , the ambitions and maneuverings of the most prominent party aristocrats are also getting considerable exposure . Looking at the structure of Taiwan 's voting population , at bottom the ratio of 60% blue vs . 40% green is quite firmly established , and parties on both sides are finding it difficult to make inroads into the other camp .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
His most fervent hope is that political leaders and the 600,000-strong army of public servants will " jointly build a culture of public service encompassing the nation 's legal system , institutions , and education system , in which public servants are conscientious , impartial , incorruptible and insightful , the talented are given their due , and those in the lower ranks have reason to be satisfied with their jobs . "  
When the participants boarded the ferry and completed the short hop to Xiamen , it constituted the first cultural exchange between Kinmen and the PRC under the newly established " three mini-links . " It was very gratifying to see the artistic occasion carried off without the slightest hint of political overtones .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
Chang Chi-luan , whom the historian Wu Hsiang-hsiang referred to as " the model Chinese newspaper man , " always held onto the spirit of a traditional Chinese man of letters . When he put out the Takungpao , he proclaimed his famous " four ' nevers ' " : " Never serve any political faction , never sell out , never be selfish , and never become blind to the truth . " Strengthening the character of Chinese newspapermen , he created a model of journalistic ethics .  
However , in contrast to the relative independence of European and American think tanks , in Taiwan , where political power has always held the upper hand over pure academic research , think tanks operate with such obvious political orientations that outsiders naturally assume that think tanks are nothing but parrots reflecting the views of the powers-that-be .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible . In fact , they are often at cross-purposes , and the resulting confusion has made it still more difficult for Taiwan to chart a course for the future .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
Most observers of the 2002 elections believe that in the past the DPP could count on the firm support of 30-40% of grassroots voters , but they are watching with keen interest to see whether this support base will be as solid this time round , following the transfer of central government power to the DPP and the political upheavals of the last two years .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
The draft bill included specific provisions defining political contributions as the outright gift of personal property or real estate , or the provision of other economic benefits , to a person or group participating in an election campaign or otherwise engaged in political activities .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .  
It had withdrawn from the United Nations and diplomatic ties with Japan had been severed . Along with the political debate , a wave of nativization swept through every level of Taiwanese society . Within the literary community , a reevaluation of the Modernism it had adopted with Westernization was unavoidable .  
In Taiwanese society at large , everyone has gained the right to freedom of expression and is able to criticize publicly the political situation , even the president and high officials . Within the literary field , a myriad of new directions have opened up . Aboriginal literature , new feminist literature , environmental literature , gay literature , and pornographic literature have taken the stage one after another , providing material for readers of every taste .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Thirty years ago , when martial was still in effect , the heavy hand of political authority held Taida in a tight grip . But the NTU spirit of never compromising was not extinguished .  
NTU 's impressive influence has continued for half a century and remains as robust as ever . As Lin Ku-fang-chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at Fokuang University 's College of Humanities and himself a Taida grad ( in archeology ) - reminds us , " The importance of National Taiwan University is not in that today it still has the highest average test scores among incoming freshmen of any school in the country , nor that it enjoys political influence and gets huge amounts of money from the government .  
" Although you could n't really say that the number of contracts actually signed is huge , we 're setting ourselves up for the future as a kind of consultant , helping integrate and strengthen each individual client according to their respective distribution weaknesses , " says Choice Group vice-chairman Jimmy Cheng . Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another . In today 's Taiwan , where there is still plenty of room for improvement in democratic institutions and where there still exist great differences on the question of national identity , both sides must proceed cautiously . Only in this way will they truly be able to seize the moment and usher in real political reform and a deepening of the democratic process .  
Will the evolution of food serve as a metaphor for the whole relationship ? Recently all the major political parties in Taiwan have been at war over the issue of public referenda , amidst dark hints from the United States and overt threats from the PRC . One can not help but sigh . When we were small , " recovering the mainland " was the unquestionable mission of the nation , and " pacifism " was a betrayal of the country and an evasion of moral responsibility .  
Yet no matter what political slogans may have declared , no matter how popular nostalgic soap operas about the mainland were or how authentic the cuisine remained , none of these things could overcome one basic fact-the two sides were separated for 40 years , during which there was no contact , families were separated , no one traveled to see the mainland 's famous scenery , and all we could know about what was going on behind the PRC 's " bamboo curtain " were shocking photographs of famine years .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
For Chiang Wei-shui personally , the 144 days that he spent in prison as a result of his two arrests connected with the incident provided him with an opportunity to do more reading and thinking . During this time he immersed himself in the theory of political and social movements and laid a solid foundation for the future development of such activities in Taiwan .  
Tang says that in college , most of his classmates were immersed in leftist thinking for a long time , and generally identified with the more " progressive " political party . But since the DPP won the presidential election in 2000 , the nature of politics has changed , and people have scattered among the various political parties . Policy has become more important than party identification , and different people work for different parties often just because they support some very specific policies of a given party .  
Thereafter , activists were absorbed into the mainstream political forces , and on both the political stage and in the business community they have played increasingly important roles . In these roles they have been given mixed reviews , being seen as " bold and idealistic " but also as naive " Boy Scouts . " The sixth and seventh generations-those aged 18-30 or so today , and thus the core group of interest to us here-are those of the age of mass university attendance .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
But it is worth noting that these young people are rather dissatisfied with Taiwan 's current political and economic situation , and most believe they are powerless to affect the overall picture . This survey also points up an important trend : among this generation with its extremely high proportion of highly educated people , education level is a significant variable when it comes to values and dreams . Compared with the past , the dreams and values of highly educated people are driving and guiding the direction of this generation as never before !  
Some people in political circles are worried that the " strategic ambiguity " that has characterized Taiwan-US-China relations over the years will be undermined and a premature showdown forced as a result of sentiments expressed in a referendum . The rapid rise of mainland China in recent years has brought it international political and economic power that can not be ignored . If the US leans toward the PRC , this may have unfortunate consequences for Taiwan .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan .

This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
This remains a major preoccupation , as events since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil conflicts and political instability in many countries , particularly in the developing world , have become endemic , with grave consequences for international peace and security . 
The need to stabilize the political situation in that country is strictly linked to the future prospects of the ongoing political stabilization in neighbouring Rwanda , where mankind has recently witnessed horrible crimes and the untold suffering of innocent civilians . 
Years of apartheid rule have bequeathed the overwhelming majority black population with a heavy legacy of poverty , social disintegration and political cleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities .  
We are a nation deeply committed to the proper functioning of democratic institutions , having attained a commendable political stability in our continent 's community of nations .  
At the recent Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing , the international community recognized the crucial role that women play in the development process and acknowledged that effective international cooperation for development will remain an elusive goal unless women can participate fully in the political , economic and social life of their respective societies . 
Despite this solemn commitment , some of those involved in political life , manipulated from abroad , are trying desperately to hoodwink national and international public opinion by saying that the Government are responsible for delaying the votes .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
The opposition to a strong and dynamic United Nations is political and profoundly ideological , and is largely concentrated in a few States whose establishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in which their domestic and global policies can be challenged or trimmed .  But the United Nations exists for all humankind , not just a handful of Member States representing a small minority of the world 's population . . . .  
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
Philip ( Solomon Islands ) : It is indeed fitting that this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly is being presided over by Mr . Freitas do Amara of Portugal , a distinguished teacher of law , an experienced parliamentarian , and the founder of one of the major political parties that helped to return vibrant democracy to his homeland .  
Today , when the international political situation opens up vast prospects for frequent recourse to the jurisdiction of the Court , anachronisms , conservative tendencies and all kinds of interests unfortunately prevent the total flourishing of an international judicial order binding on all , beginning with the most powerful among us . 
In 1987 , when our Governments decided to take up the historic challenge of achieving a political solution to the Central American crisis through the peace process adopted in Esquipulas II , they also recognized that peace and development were inseparable and that the consolidation of democracy presupposed the establishment of a system of well-being and economic and social justice , which is indispensable in helping to overcome the deep-rooted causes of that conflict .  
Peace can only be maintained by observing such norms governing international relations as respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , and by establishing , in accordance with the United Nations Charter , a new international political and economic order that is just and fair .  
At the same time , though , there is a growing danger of armed conflicts breaking out because of continuing economic , political , territorial , ethnic , religious and other imbalances in relations between States .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
The so-called underdeveloped world is not calling on the international community for hand-outs or privileged positions in trade ; all it is asking for is fair , transparent and egalitarian treatment , with terms of trade that are not distorted by political pricing , hidden subsidies and dumping practices whose persistence in international trade causes real havoc in the economies of a large number of nations .  
The European Union is a common project for living together in peace , for shared political , economic and social values , which has enabled Europe to re-emerge from its ashes and to establish itself as a focal point of stability and progress in the international arena . 
None the less , the United Nations attained important and substantial achievements , outstanding among which were its significant contributions to avoiding another world war with unimaginable consequences , eliminating colonialism and racial discrimination , encouraging the codification of international law , strengthening the international system of human rights protection and promoting international cooperation for the improvement of the political , economic and social conditions of our peoples .  
The cold war is over , the geopolitical map has been radically altered , a worldwide democratization process has emerged , cooperation has replaced confrontation and a globalization process has begun in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres .  
In fact , many are unprepared to accept that human beings and nations are entitled to move steadily upward on economic , social , political and cultural trajectories which will provide genuine equality . 
Indeed , the widespread desire to bring uniformity to international society in political and institutional terms , on the one hand , and economic and social terms , on the other , has led to an imbalance every bit as dramatic as the imbalance not so long ago when the world was bipolar .  
Fifty years ago , in the aftermath of the Second World War , the international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , resolved at San Francisco to create an Organization that would establish the political , economic and social conditions for a new and lasting peace .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
At that time , the United Nations will have to play an active and decisive role so as to maintain the social , economic and political balance among the nations that make it up , with the understanding that all have the same rights and obligations now that we are enjoying a relative peace and that titanic efforts are under way to resolve the conflicts that persist .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
They have understood that democratization is a long-term undertaking , one that must be based on the historical , social and cultural realities of a country if it is to be effective and promote political stability , economic development and social justice .  
Far from accepting this situation as our fated lot and aware that we must rely on our own efforts , this year the African countries adopted , in Egypt , the Cairo Programme of Action , which aims at ensuring the immediate relaunching of Africa 's economic and social development through political and economic reforms and a global and coherent strategy .  
History is replete with instances of youth frustration militating against development and social progress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing political and social institutions were either unwilling or unable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to youth problems and aspirations . 
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Over the years this call , addressed to a world undergoing continuous and rapid change , has not ceased to be heard , even if the voice has sometimes been muted by political and economic circumstances , by wars and calamities , by social movements , and by walls destroyed or raised .  
Riera Escudero ( Paraguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Republic of Paraguay , which has a long history of authoritarian Governments , has enjoyed full civil and political freedoms for more than six years now , as part of a democratic process which , slowly but surely , is being consolidated and strengthened , with the consensus of a noble , peace-loving and hard-working people that makes daily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its children . 
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
The poverty alleviation programme aims to enable every Malawian to have access to basic necessities and to be able to develop and exploit his or her full potential to lead a productive , dignified and creative life through social , economic and political empowerment .  
To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and , at the same time , to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural , social , economic and political reality .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .  
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
There is extraordinary cooperation on the part of States , other political entities and non-governmental organizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern of the United Nations organs ; in the burgeoning , multidimensional sphere of sustainable development ; in the territory where humane concerns and values , social ordering and cultural norms coalesce ; and in the field of peace-keeping , of providing States and peoples with security from violence and disorder .  
However , the lack of political will to suppress aggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with United Nations decisions , coupled with the unreasonable , immoral and legally baseless insistence by some on extending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia to the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the Serbs that they can continue with impunity their murder , destruction , aggression , ethnic cleansing and genocide .  
Regarding the organization and the direction of the Olympic Movement , a pivotal role is being played by His Excellency Mr . Juan Antonio Samaranch , who , through his policy of engaging in personal contacts and through the prestige which he enjoys throughout the world , within the most varied of political and diplomatic circles , has succeeded in making the Olympic Movement an interlocutor of the most representative and the largest world forum , the United Nations .  
Georgiades ( Cyprus ) : In a world faced with unabated turmoil , the ancient Greek spirit that gave rise to the Olympian ideal of athletic achievement and excellence transcends the cultural and political boundaries that divide human communities .  
The world community must continue to afford effective assistance to the Central American countries in averting new outbreaks of tension , in ensuring that the processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State structures , in strengthening the climate of political tolerance , in the strict observance of human rights , and in their economic recovery .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus . 
On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
Well-structured , effective , mutually independent and collaborative State institutions , an equitable political system , a harmonized legal system , overall security and economic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic State .  
The United Nations agencies involved in the entire range of processes covered under this omnibus goal should ensure that their activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular the sovereign equality and political independence of States , territorial integrity , and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State .  
Fifthly , sharing democratic values is of crucial importance for the political , economic and social processes in national societies , as well as for international peace and security .  
As we see it , the value of democratization is primarily that , having become an integral part of the internal political processes , it provides a basis for reconciliation , tolerance , full application of , respect for and defence of human rights , and the development of social practices based on the peaceful search for constructive solutions .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
We do recognize also that there are some legitimate considerations that have to be addressed in the negotiating process , including internal territorial delineations and means to rebuild the confidence of the population in the political processes and mechanisms that are designed to secure respect for human rights .  
These variable criteria are subject to historical , human , demographic , political , economic , territorial and other changes .  
Its contribution to disseminating information about the importance of free and fair elections , the participation of women and men as equal partners in social , economic and political life , and the protection and promotion of human rights and individual freedom has undoubtedly been singular .  
The changes of the last decade in economic and political conditions and new consensuses reached during the recent series of conferences offer a unique opportunity to develop an intensified , strengthened and more realistic approach to such cooperation , but the opportunity may go to waste if we fail to shape a more efficient , creative and forward-looking United Nations . 
As is recalled in resolution 48 / 162 , the General Assembly is the main forum where Governments pursue the development dialogue in a political context , oriented towards taking an integrated view of matters pertaining to the economic , social and related fields in order to build and deepen the political understanding required for enhanced international development cooperation . 
In our view , a speedy recovery from the critical situation of depleting resources requires , first and foremost , that the developed countries honour their political commitments by increasing substantially their contributions to resources on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , especially their official development assistance . 
While my delegation is fully committed to participating actively and constructively in future consultations on new modalities for funding for operational activities for development , we believe that what is now crucial is the political will and determination of all parties on how best to arrest the downward spiral of resources for development . 
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
In our view , the increasing awareness of the need to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms is closely and organically linked to and essential for the progress of society and the advancement of its members at the economic , political , cultural and social levels .  
At the social level it is indisputable that intolerance of racial , religious , ethnic , language and gender differences is exploited by groups which seek to attain or maintain economic and political power over others .  
Elsewhere in the draft resolution 's operative part , the Secretary-General is requested to continue to deploy his efforts towards strengthening cooperation and coordination between the two organizations and their specialized agencies in order for the two organizations to enhance their capacity to serve their mutual interests in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields .  
The agenda of the latest meeting between the two organizations included a number of issues of paramount importance , including political questions , such as the maintenance of international peace and security ; humanitarian issues , such as mine clearance ; and such economic and social issues as desertification control , protection of the environment , sustainable development , narcotics control and crime prevention .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
This means that nothing could be done in the absence of the political will of States that bear the responsibility of dispelling doubts and remedying the disaffection that is noticeable today vis - - vis the United Nations by giving true meaning to the Organization 's invaluable and multifarious contributions towards the promotion of an international society that is more just , better organized and better structured .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
El Salvador experienced one of the most severe , complex and difficult crises in Central America in the second half of this century in the 1980s , to be precise , when a military and political conflict began and went on for 12 years .  
In considering the continuum with respect to systematic breakdowns or societal implosion , the matter becomes more complicated in the sense that the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance in contributing to rebuilding a society decimated by conflict depends on how effectively the underlying political problems of such emergencies have been addressed .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
Regional cooperation is a goal which we all seek , but it must be the result of the achievement of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , including the resolution of the final status issues , as provided for in the Declaration of Principles . We believe that this goal should be reached gradually , moving parallel to the political developments achieved and supporting them , not preceding them .  
We are convinced that the adoption of this balanced draft resolution will give political support to efforts to establish a post-confrontational Middle East , based on broad international cooperation and the accelerated economic development of that region .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
The challenge the international community now faces is threefold : to ensure that recent positive developments do not founder for lack of economic and political support , to nurture progress on the other bilateral tracks of negotiations to match that achieved between Israel and the PLO and to prevent acts of violence and terrorism by extremist groups that seek to endanger the peace process and threaten to drive the Middle East back into conflict and suffering .  
I wish to express the hope that the practical implementation of this document will contribute to the continuation of the negotiating process towards the final settlement of the problem by political means and to the establishment of lasting peace and mutual understanding in the Middle East , and will serve the cause of the Palestinian people 's exercise of its right to national self-determination through the creation of an independent State of Palestine .  
It is therefore essential that the international community defend the peace process , give it political , economic and moral support and encourage the parties concerned to work for a genuine peace based on mutual understanding , cooperation , security , dignity and respect for the legitimate rights of all .  
It also urged the international community to increase the financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial to regenerate economic growth and sustainable development , and to provide effective support to political reforms and help cushion their adverse social consequences .  
These reports have been at once analytical , comprehensive and insightful inasmuch as they have exposed the dark cloud hanging over much of Africa , threatening to drag the continent deeper into economic ruin , social decay and political instability .  
As regards Africa , the steady deterioration of economic and social conditions can only contribute to confirming the pessimistic views regarding a continent that has been marginalized and left to its own devices to deal with the many political , economic , social and ecological crises besetting it .  
We should resolutely address the endogenous impediments to growth and development , which include political instability , ineffective and inefficient utilization of both human and material resources , inappropriate priority-setting , ill-conceived policy orientation and ill-designed and impractical implementation mechanisms . 
This is so for a number of reasons : first , its long-standing relationship with the countries in and around the conflict area and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced and durable political settlement ; secondly , because of the experience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with a long record of practical work in the area ; thirdly , acquired knowledge and expertise in working with international financial institutions in implementing programmes for reconstruction and development .  
Building upon political and economic stability , ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed that contribute to consolidating the opening of our economies , the transparency of our markets , and the growth of commercial exchange with other regions in short , the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a better future for our peoples .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
Therefore , in that regard , my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee , given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee 's work is progressive , innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social , economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration , and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
A common agreement was reached in Copenhagen aimed at creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment , based on democracy , full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , equality between men and women , the elimination of all forms of discrimination , solidarity , transparent and accountable governance and administration , and the encouragement of partnership with free and representative organizations of civil society . 
This is an imaginative , promotive , contemporary and fair State that respects economic , political and social balance and makes room for individual and collective creativity in society .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
Fernandes ( India ) : At the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen , our leaders committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
My delegation expresses the hope that this debate may reflect the tone of an international community resolved to fight for its future , a community that in the midst of its needs and aspirations has confidence that the United Nations can faithfully carry out the mandate of the World Summit for Social Development , which , as this General Assembly has already stated , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative for humankind .  
To deal with these problems is a political , social and ethical imperative for us all that requires a collective approach , both national and international , on the basis of a new understanding of cooperation , equality , tolerance and respect for the customs and beliefs of different societies .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
This is because we are fully aware , as the Summit itself has underscored , that nothing short of a renewed and massive political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
The priority objectives of guaranteeing the social protection of the individual , promoting his social integration and guaranteeing social peace and harmony can not be attained without a firm political will to invest at the national level , but also at the international level , in the well-being of all .  
Through these actions it aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
Consensus in Beijing revolved around these basic principles : violence against women must stop ; girls must be valued equally with boys ; women must have equal access to education , health care and the levers of economic and political power ; family responsibilities should be shared ; and the human rights of women are an integral component of all human rights they are neither separable nor different from those of men .  
The European Union considers that the presidential elections scheduled for 17 December should reinforce the achievements already made and should provide an example of harmony and tolerance , so that the entire population of Haiti can attain genuine national reconciliation and lay the foundations for the political , economic and social reconstruction of their country .  
In this context , the continued support of the United Nations system and the international community , which is recognized in this draft resolution , will be critical in providing the people of Haiti with a second chance to secure a democratic future , in which their political and development aspirations can be fulfilled .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Rowe ( Australia ) : All discussions of the problem of land-mines are redolent with statistics and verbal images of a profoundly shocking and disturbing nature , invoking numbers of civilians , including children , killed or injured , the extent of their injuries , the cost of rehabilitation , the effect on their livelihoods and their prospects for family life , the acreage of arable land laid waste and the incalculable debilitating social and political effects of living with a constant source of terror .  
These figures highlight the fact that this is not a static problem ; it is a recurring humanitarian crisis that is worsening day by day and requires greater efforts and political will if we are to put an end to this inhumane situation in which human lives are destroyed , as is the environment as a whole .  
Without a realistic and sufficiently operational vision for dealing with the basic security and political issues in the region , the OSCE will not be able to play an active role and will react to emerging situations in a random and not necessarily successful manner .  
As a political non-governmental organization , we are active in observing troublesome electoral processes , campaigning for political and civil rights where necessary and supporting those causes that we consider fair in international politics .  
We urge the Special Committee to take very careful note of the documentation presented to it by Amnesty International , by other human rights groups and by East Timorese in exile , which details the ongoing human rights abuses in East Timor , such as torture , involuntary disappearances , maltreatment of political prisoners and extrajudicial killings .  The recent killing by the Indonesian military of 6 civilians in Liquica is but one example .  
Of more far-ranging significance is the fact that the issue of political status has now been dubbed too complicated , too confusing and too separated from the everyday issues of economic , political and social life to be of any moment to the ordinary resident of the Territory .  
Although we firmly believe that action towards securing this new international legal instrument banning nuclear-test explosions in a verifiable and comprehensive manner is well advanced and irreversible , important political decisions on key treaty elements have yet to be taken in order to meet the deadline set by the NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The Secretary-General of the United Nations , in his report on the three Regional Centres , contained in document A / 50 / 380 of 25 August 1995 , recognized and strongly emphasized the importance of the role that such institutions can play in drawing up , at the regional level , confidence-building measures , measures to strengthen social and political stability and the security of States , and to help in the limitation and neutralization of existing arsenals .  
The establishment of a conceptual link between disarmament and development by giving an impetus to more accelerated progress on the issues of global development will strengthen the roots of international peace and security and preserve the spirit of understanding , constructive cooperation and genuine political goodwill which are essential for the building of a better and more secure world . 
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance and respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted at youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Another constraint is the lack of sustained political commitment to , and support of , the process of enhanced productivity , economic growth and social equity in rural areas .  This is often caused by a lack of long-term national energy strategies with the objective of balanced national economic and social development .  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
To include within programme activities in 1994 and 1995 national case-studies of experience in the formulation and implementation of comprehensive social policies , especially in countries suffering from severe economic , political , cultural and environmental pressures , and to ensure the wide dissemination of the results of such studies ;  
Although some representatives stated that the participation of women in decision-making bodies at the national level had increased , many representatives stressed that women were still far from reaching equal power and that more radical policy interventions and strong political will would be required to bring about immediate changes , including changes in the structure and cultures of institutions .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international , political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
Furthermore , the exercise of such rights was not possible in the absence of political freedom , and their protection required States to adopt democratic practices , practices which must inevitably bring benefits since people who were free to think , exchange ideas and invest their own energies and capital would be able to contribute more to economic and social development than people stunted by repression .  
The United States urged China to take further steps to improve the human rights situation in its territory by observing international norms , preserving Tibet 's unique cultural , linguistic and religious heritage and releasing persons jailed solely for expressing political beliefs .  
In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Algeria was aware that the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles were primarily the responsibility of Governments , and it assigned a prominent place to those rights and principles in its project for the construction of a modern State based on republican principles and on the alternation of political power .  
Costa Rica was convinced that the fullest possible utilization of the existing machinery for the protection of human rights , which was now better coordinated thanks to the actions of the High Commissioner - together with the political will of States , played a crucial role in achieving the goals set out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .

In spite of some notable progress in democratization and popular participation in some African countries , a number of others remain embroiled in ethnic conflicts , political upheavals and civil wars which have resulted in a humanitarian tragedy of unprecedented proportions .  
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
That until this problem affecting Guatemalan society is resolved , its economic , political , social and cultural potential will never be able to develop fully and neither will it be able to take the place in the community of nations due to it by virtue of its ancient history and the spiritual grandeur of its peoples ;  
Recognition of the identity of the indigenous peoples is fundamental to the construction of a national unity based on respect for and the exercise of political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that this tragic incident must not be used for ethically unacceptable and inappropriate political manipulations that espouse the myth that all the sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be seen in the same criminal light and as having the same responsibility for the evil that has engulfed my country for more than three years .  
It is of great importance to the peace process that the planning and preparatory work be concluded and that the peace-keeping operation be made credible , assuring the parties and the contributing States of an effective and secure implementation of the agreement and of a close linkage to the political process towards a comprehensive settlement .  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
In 1994 , these activities included preparatory work - state-of-the-art surveys , definition of a conceptual framework and institutional linkages for future programme action - in two main areas : ethics and governance , and the interface between political , institutional and economic aspects of governance .  
Research on " Caspian , Aral and Dead Sea Water Crisis and Perspectives " has been aimed at providing a comprehensive and objective environmental management setting for sustainable development , taking into account international political considerations and conflict resolution .  State-of-the-art research papers for the Forum have been commissioned , and a long-term field research programme is being designed as a part of the present project .  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
Initially created to foster the economic empowerment of women in the developing world by improving their access to credit , productive resources , training and opportunities for income - generation , the Fund 's scope of work over the last two decades has expanded to include the promotion of women 's social and political empowerment .  
Invites the international community to continue to lend its political , diplomatic , material and financial support to end the violence , to help the Government of Burundi to find a lasting solution to the political and ethnic tensions and to create conditions to favour the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons and , in this context , requests the Secretary-General to strengthen the office of his special representative in Bujumbura ;  
The leaders of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs advocated the speedy holding in Moscow of the next , fourth , round of inter-Tajik talks , at which the fundamental questions of a political settlement must be discussed in a constructive spirit in accordance with the agenda for the talks agreed upon earlier by the parties .  
The original mandate of the Force has been enlarged by subsequent Security Council resolutions in response to the constantly changing political situation and , as stated in paragraph 6 above , the Council decided on 31 March 1995 to replace UNPROFOR with three separate but interlinked peace-keeping operations . 
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
The main objectives of the association are to further economic integration , develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea and strengthen functional cooperation in the political , cultural , scientific , social and technological areas .  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
It calls for the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex .  
States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
However , when improvement of policy development is the main goal of administrative and political reforms , to be effective and efficient in utilizing scarce improvement resources , improvement endeavour should focus on key variables exerting a major impact on the quality of policy development dealing with critical future-influencing issues and domains .  
The Counsel for Human Rights expressed concern at the increase in political and social violence and the ineffectiveness of the State institutions responsible for investigating and punishing human rights violations , and pointed to the many unsolved cases of extrajudicial execution .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
The Committee was also informed that the distribution of resources had been guided by the priority areas as identified in the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised , 2 / and also by those reflected in the budget outline , namely , political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal oversight .  
As we anticipate a continued and reinvigorated United Nations presence in Liberia , let me state that my Government stands ready , together with other members of ECOWAS , to participate in the consultations that the Secretary-General intends to undertake prior to making his recommendations to the Security Council on the future of UNOMIL . The unresolved political crisis in Liberia remains worrisome to the subregion . 
My delegation is also of the view that it is of paramount importance for UNOMIL 's mandate to be extended at this critical juncture in order to reassure the people of Liberia and simultaneously to send a strong message to the key political players in the Liberian conflict , telling them that at the present time not only is the fate of their people in their hands , but also that an entire nation 's chances of survival depend on their good sense , bona fides and responsibility .  
We note with regret that half a year has passed since the signing of the Accra agreement , but that the Liberian parties have not implemented its basic provisions , thus demonstrating a clear disregard for the future of their own country and for the aspirations of its people , a people essentially held hostage to the personal political ambitions of the leaders of the armed factions .  
The continuing political impasse in the Liberian peace process is a sign of a dangerous trend , also manifested in the Liberian parties ' disregard of the numerous appeals issued by the international community and by African regional organizations , in particular the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , and of the vigorous efforts aimed at the speedy achievement of a political settlement in that country .  
The lack of concrete progress in the political process and , which is even more serious , with regard to the cease-fire , the lack of harmonization in the policies and efforts of all the parties involved and the unfortunate continuation of the flow of arms to the country have now made it necessary to make international support conditional on the existence of real , concrete political will among the parties peacefully to resolve their differences and achieve national reconciliation .  
The representative of Iraq denies that his country refused to sign the minutes of the most recent meeting of the tripartite committee , which was held at Geneva on 7 April 1995 , and claims that none of the parties signed the document when Kuwait insisted on imposing political conditions that bore no relation to the humanitarian issue on which the meeting had been convened ;  
Ensuring a modicum of the sense of the individual , local , and national security : peaceful political and favourable national and international economic conditions . "  
During the discussion the Administrator also clarified that the programming emphasis on the enabling environment required for poverty elimination supported the first commitment of the World Summit for Social Development ( WSSD ) , which focused on creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
Given the increasing complexity of its role in facilitating development among countries with widely varying economic , social and political systems , innovative means of fostering communication , coordination , and organizational learning within and among its member countries are essential if the United Nations is to play a successful role in this dynamic environment .  
This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .  
Whereas all peoples have the right of self-determination and by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development and may , for their own ends , freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation , based upon the principle of mutual benefit and international law ;  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
With the institution of SICA , integration is no longer sectoral that is , commercial and economic but comprehensive , meaning that it extends to the economic , social , cultural and political spheres and seeks to promote their harmonious and balanced development .  
In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement , Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region ; democracies have been established and transformed ; respect for human rights has been strengthened , and the new regional integration system has been defined . "  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
An international judicial commission of inquiry , however , could be viable and useful if its mandate gave it powers that would guarantee that its conclusions and recommendations would be put into effect and achieve the objective of prosecuting and punishing those responsible for the assassination of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993 , for the massacres that followed and for other serious acts of violence and political crimes committed since October 1993 ;  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Commends the people of Haiti for their peaceful participation in the first round of municipal and legislative elections and calls upon the Government and political parties in Haiti to work together to ensure that the remaining municipal and legislative elections and the presidential elections to be held at the end of this year are conducted in an orderly , peaceful , free and fair manner , in accordance with the Haitian Constitution ;

" With such political , economic and social developments , the Republic of China on Taiwan has a strong desire , and sufficient capability , to reciprocate for what it has received from the international community , and to fulfil its international responsibilities in order to contribute to global peace and prosperity .  
Ensuring the backstopping of essential human freedoms such as acceptably peaceful and equitable political , economic and social environments that promote individual , local and national security .  
The Fifth Summit will chart ASEAN 's future direction towards intensifying political , economic and functional cooperation to make ASEAN an even more cohesive and dynamic regional grouping .  
Bearing in mind the reaction of the most important international factors , inappropriate to the nature and size of the aggression , the Federal Government has charged the competent authorities with the task of intensifying political , diplomatic and informative activities aimed at having adequate decisions brought by the international community and at fully informing it of the policy of Croatia which constitutes the greatest danger for peace and security in the Balkans .  
It is also vital that the parties continue to demonstrate the political will and commitment necessary for the achievement of peace and national reconciliation through strict and timely compliance with the Acordos de Paz , the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions , with a view to achieving durable peace , security , and economic and social development in their country .  
It was agreed that the forging of an integrated United Nations system approach in post-conflict situations could be greatly assisted by the development of a strategic framework combining political , humanitarian , economic and social areas of intervention .  
Oman believes that there is an obligation a moral obligation , a political obligation on all members of the international community to work together united with one voice that would say No to ethnic cleansing , No to rape of Muslim women and No to the continued violations of the safe areas . 
They are , inter alia , rights to equality of treatment and non-discrimination ; such cultural rights as the right to use indigenous languages , to use indigenous dress and to practise indigenous forms of spirituality ; such civil and political rights as the rights to practise traditional indigenous forms of social organization ; and such economic and social rights as the right to hold land under traditional forms of tenure .  
Yugoslavia 's continued and concrete contribution to the process of negotiation is considered by a large part of the international community as proof of its sincere and lasting orientation towards peace and a comprehensive political solution of the Yugoslav crisis .  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) , adopted by the General Assembly in 1989 and since ratified by 177 States , is an international instrument that promotes and protects the human rights of children in different areas ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ) .  
The unique character of the Congress , in which the participants combined political leverage and expertise , and which served as a forum for the world-wide sharing of knowledge , exchange of experience and transfer of technological know-how , has been widely recognized , and its productive results were emphasized both at the Congress and at the Commission 's subsequent session . 
The commission of inquiry might be of assistance here as well inasmuch as it might make recommendations concerning appropriate legal , political or administrative measures , for such measures are probably necessary if Burundi is in the future to avoid not only the vortex of Rwanda , but also the twin dangers of a dictatorship based on the predominant majority of one ethnic group as well as a dictatorship based on a firepower monopoly of the other ethnic group . 
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
At the same time , national legislation must be very harsh on State services such as intelligence or security services , or authorities with repressive proclivities , or private totalitarian-minded associations which , resorting to markets where mercenaries are available , recruit individuals for the purpose of establishing praetorian guards , death squads or operational groups devoted to political repression or to the assassination of political , religious or other adversaries .

On the other hand , the memorandum of understanding confirmed the principle of respect for and defence of the democratic model contained in the Constitution , obliging each to recognize the popular will expressed through universal suffrage as the sole and exclusive way to maintain and obtain political power . 
The declaration on the historical reconciliation between Romania and Hungary may be accompanied by a juridical bilateral document laying down the mechanisms and instruments , as well as a code of conduct on issues of ethnic minorities , which the two countries would agree to establish in order to attain these goals , as well as by concrete programmes of action at political , economic , strategic , cultural levels , and in other fields of common interest .  
We are firmly committed to initiating a new era in the Caribbean region characterized by the strengthening of integration , concerted action and consultation in order to ensure greater cultural , economic , political , scientific , social and technological cooperation among our peoples , Governments and countries ;  
Croatia 's views stem from its geo-strategic position and its political , economic , technological and cultural features , and are thus closely linked to its long-term strategic interests , including a political settlement to the crisis in the region as a precondition for democratic and independent development .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
National implementation of international instruments : It was recognized that a gap exists between international instruments and implementation at the national level : the lack of effective implementation of international obligations is due to economic , social and political difficulties inherent in the transition process .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .  The United Nations system 's effort at capacity-building is now undertaken mainly by individual organizations in relation to their respective mandates and focused primarily on their domestic counterparts .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
Establish , consistent with data protection legislation , databases on women and their qualification for use in appointing women to senior decision-making and advisory positions , for dissemination to Governments , regional and international organizations and private enterprise , political parties and other relevant bodies .  
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
Based on a strong political commitment , create a national machinery , where it does not exist , and strengthen , as appropriate , existing national machineries , for the advancement of women at the highest possible level of government ; it should have clearly defined mandates and authority ; critical elements would be adequate resources and the ability and competence to influence policy and formulate and review legislation .  
The Platform for Action reaffirms that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , as expressed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights .  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable are possible only through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .  
The Islamic State of Afghanistan would like to assure you that the freedom-loving people of Afghanistan do realize their prime national obligation to liberate the western parts of Afghanistan , including occupied Herat , and to force the Pakistani militia out of the area by a general and resolute armed struggle , in favour of the country 's political and administrative unity .  
Also at the sixth round , the two sides , without prejudice to their respective positions of principle regarding the political status of East Timor , began discussions on the substantive issues identified by me regarding possible avenues for a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution .  
The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .  
The 142 States present at the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Crime proclaimed their political will and strong determination , as well as their unequivocal commitment , to ensure the full and expeditious implementation of the Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , reflecting the urgency and priority attention attached to action against organized transnational crime .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
In most developing countries and countries in transition , however , various factors , ranging from lack of adequate resources to recent rapid political and economic developments and changes , have slowed down or inhibited the process of attaining a thorough understanding of the situation .  
It should also consider conditions that are conducive to the rise and growth of criminal organizations , such as social , economic and political factors , structural characteristics of organized crime , as well as organizational shortcomings in the control agencies .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
Building on the established consensus and taking full advantage of the present political climate , which is conducive to more meaningful international cooperation , States should specify the activities that need to be undertaken for implementation , agree on the pace of such implementation and devote their energies and undivided attention towards achieving the common goals identified in the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan .  
The imposition of coercive economic measures ignores such principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States , and violates international legal instruments with the intent of forcibly imposing the political will of the sending State and subverting the political , economic and social regime of the target State .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
The specific , defining feature of coercive economic measures is that of negative economic activities applied for political purposes , forming part of discriminatory or punitive interventionist policies .  
They range from alleged threats to the national security of the sender State and the alleged violation of agreed international norms and instruments by the target State , to expressions of dislike for specific domestic or foreign policies of the target State or more generally for the political and socio-economic system of the target State .  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from ten to seven , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
It was agreed that the Committee should be flexible and simply take note of the existence of national institutions , irrespective of the political or ideological regime under which they had been established , bearing in mind that they could be improved and that technical assistance could be provided to that end .  
Whatever the specific arrangements for the Assembly 's review , it is essential to ensure that its outcome contributes to maintaining the political momentum and visibility of the sustainable development agenda as well as to the broader discussion currently under way of the reform of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields and to discussions on the agenda for development and the coordinated follow-up of other major United Nations conferences .  
It is increasingly apparent that the world Organization finds itself working in a new communications age defined by rapidly changing political environments , equally swift technological developments , unprecedented budget pressures on major contributing countries , and the rising power and world-wide reach of the media .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
" We have promoted racial understanding , and sought to guarantee to everyone , without distinction as to race , colour , national or ethnic origin , the right to equality before the law in civil , political and economic rights .  
Structurally , racial discrimination through denial takes on insidious and subtle forms , and subsists as a vicious circle that only political will based on a clear and courageous facing of reality can break , by attacking the evil .

The international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , endeavoured at the San Francisco Conference , 50 years ago , to create an international Organization that would be able to prevent such calamities in the future by establishing the political , economic and social conditions for a new , more peaceful and safer world .  
We must assume the historic commitment to accept the challenge and to devote ourselves with enthusiasm to the shaping of a new world , which will do away with political , religious and racial intolerance , which will eliminate inequality and social backwardness , which will establish human fraternity and solidarity , a new world in which the beacon of freedom and democracy will light its path . 
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
But when the time comes to negotiate multilateral replenishments , additional multilateral resources are seen as coming at the expense of already stretched bilateral programmes , which are usually perceived to bring political benefits or to respond more closely to donor Government policies and priorities , since the donor itself is responsible for their supervision and control .  
Horrendous atrocities committed by the regular army of Croatia in Western Slavonia and Krajina which resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs , the looting and burning of Serb houses and the expulsion of about 500,000 of them from their ancestral homes , have proved that the main Croatian political goal is to establish an ethnically pure State .  
NULLIn its resolution 1995 / 52 of 3 March 1995 on the situation of human rights in Togo , the Commission , inter alia , welcomed the fact that Togo had set out on the road to democratic political change , and urged all Togolese to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections held in February 1994 and to ensure the effective functioning of the democratically elected parliament .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .  
The complex social and political circumstances of the rural human settlements indicates that the transfer of their productive , social and habitational infrastructure will remain an issue of particular delicacy , with a potential for aggravated social tension within the regions where they are situated .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) was hampered by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
A positive scenario for rapprochement between the people , its Government and the political parties would be the definition , with broad civil participation , of a national development strategy for the medium and long term , to which the main political forces and the Government were committed .

NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
In the aforesaid resolution , the General Assembly enumerated the High Commissioner 's responsibilities , which basically involve promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
" Accordingly , I would be most grateful to continue benefitting from the cooperation of your Excellency 's Government so that I may provide the General Assembly and the Commission with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights in Myanmar .

" Accordingly , I would be most grateful to continue benefitting from the cooperation of your Excellency 's Government so that I may provide the Commission and the General Assembly with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil , and political rights in Myanmar in accordance with the provisions contained in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995 / 72 .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
NULLThe events described above , coupled with other political and military developments within the Republic of Croatia and the contiguous territories of the former Yugoslavia , as well as the frequently declared intention of the Croatian authorities to recover lost territories by other means if negotiations did not succeed , made it very difficult to resume meaningful negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion .  
Accordingly , special attention had been paid to strengthening the Organization 's capacity to deal with political and peace-keeping activities , reinforcing international and regional cooperation for development , enhancing support for human rights and humanitarian activities , and increasing internal oversight capacity .  
NULLWhile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
In order to be included in the list of crimes in the draft Code , such infractions must correspond to the legal rules accepted by States , must be considered serious enough to be defined as crimes against the peace and security of mankind , and must refer to acts sufficiently identifiable to appear in a criminal text .  The matter should be dealt with only from a legal , not a political , perspective .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality , and we call upon the States of the world :  
In this context , it is worth mentioning that the changes taking place in Cuban society , principally in the economic sector , are creating a more conducive framework enabling the incipient movement of non-governmental organizations to reform Cuban civil society and to call for democratic rules in relations between society and the political authorities .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
It involves the transmission of knowledge and the affirmation of values that emphasize peaceful coexistence , responsibility , tolerance , solidarity and justice and that promote the development of individuals who show social solidarity and who are active and tolerant in the political sphere , productive in the economic sphere , respectful of human rights and aware of the value of the natural environment .  
We want to generate broad support for an improved global multilateral system , based upon a renewed political will of all Member States , and which draws on the energies and the commitment of independent organizations of civil society .  
It presented the eradication of poverty as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative ( Declaration , Commitment 2 ) and stressed that societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families , and the communities in which they live ( ibid . , para .

Some claim to have been denied housing because they are not associated with successful political parties or because they were orphans , refugees or other disadvantaged people who returned to the city or town too late , or were too powerless , to secure access to free housing in premises abandoned by their former owners .  
Its closing consensus statement emphasized that media scrutiny of the exercise of political power was essential in a democratic society ; that all media laws should conform to international and constitutional standards ; and that journalists themselves have a duty to work to the highest professional standards .  
Turning to the report on the sources of finance for development at mid-decade ( A / 50 / 397 ) , he noted that the marked increases in private resource flows to Asia and Latin America , which had far exceeded official flows , reflected successful economic reforms and strengthened political confidence in those regions .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
In addition , the phenomenon of the caste system , which could be characterized as multiple apartheid , also must be addressed openly with a view to mitigating the suffering of millions of people living a life of bondage and discrimination which divided them into upper and lower echelons , segregated them and excluded them from the political , economic , social and cultural spheres of society . 
In his country , whose population reflected an ethnic mixture created by successive waves of migrants , his Government had systematically extended moral , political and material support to all peoples struggling against racial discrimination and apartheid .  
At a time when the United Nations is frequently faulted for not being equipped to deal with pressing challenges , we do well to recall the pivotal role of our world Organization and its agencies in spearheading efforts to secure equal access for women in all aspects of political , economic and social development .  
The United States legal system was an excellent example of a system based on laws that respected the basic civil and political rights of all individuals as a precondition for any society hoping to eliminate racial discrimination .  
Although the Turkish Cypriots now live free from Greek Cypriot harassment , oppression and terror , an inhuman embargo on their political , economic , social and cultural activity , imposed by the other side , continues .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic or designer drugs , has expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
After having undertaken a drastic policy of ethnic cleansing against Serbs , the Croatian authorities are already calling into question the Serbs ' right to be represented in Parliament , the Government , regional and other authorities because for that aspect of political life they do not fulfil the new condition of representing the prescribed 8 per cent in Croatia 's total population .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .  
It is clear that continuous Croatian threats , sabre rattling and persistent military provocations , as well as the deployment of great number of Croatian troops in the contiguous territories of Srem and Baranja , are not a way to overcome major outstanding problems in a satisfactory manner , i.e . , by peaceful means and through political negotiations .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
To the contrary , in the prevailing legal and political order in Iraq with life-threatening laws applicable to persons expressing any opposition to the Government , the conduct of the referendum made a mockery of relevant international human rights standards .  
The relative success of the Federation in protecting the international civil servant against gross political interference by one member country did not mean that , overnight , FICSA became a respected interlocutor of the management in the common system organizations .  
Article 14 , after all , prohibited " extreme economic or political coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act " , while article 13 stated clearly that such measures would not be permitted .  
Article 14 contained a list of prohibited countermeasures , including extreme coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State that had committed an internationally wrongful act , in other words measures of " intervention " .  
Noting that throughout all continents of the world a considerable number of societies have recently initiated bold , profound and daring attempts to achieve their social , political and economic goals through democratization and reforming their economies , pursuits that are deserving of the support and recognition of the international community ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
An international and independent court that was free from political pressures , established on a solid legal basis , accepted by all States to deal with well-defined crimes and capable of offering maximum guarantees to the defendants would provide , particularly where prevention was concerned , an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises which had adverse effects on entire peoples .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
Factors such as a strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates and have helped these countries to address some of the constraints facing their economies .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;

A political consensus in the international community on the right to development was achieved for the first time at the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of the fundamental rights of the human person , the human person being the central subject of development .  
the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights " .  
" an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The right to development combines a comprehensive conception of development in its economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and a requirement of whole and entire realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the self-determination of peoples .  
It goes beyond the traditional conception of economic , social and cultural development by integrating in it the political dimension , basing it on popular participation and social justice , and focusing it on the human being , who is both its artisan and its chief beneficiary .  
As soon afterwards as 1968 the Proclamation of Tehran drew attention to the danger of this dissociation of human rights by proclaiming that : " Since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible " .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development points out that " All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights " .  
Again , by giving a comprehensive definition of development and representing it to be a simultaneously economic , social , cultural and political process , the Declaration on the Right to Development reflects the international community 's will to revise national and international development strategies in the light of the disappointing experience of several United Nations Development Decades .  
The Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims in its article 1 that " the right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized " .  
The full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
Such reports might , for example , highlight the progress made in formulating new global development strategies or policies , international development cooperation , the promotion of popular participation and social justice and the simultaneous promotion of full respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Accordingly , full implementation and realization of the Declaration calls for a genuine democratization of international economic and political relations , a process that will negate the adverse consequences of the current process of globalization and foster a new climate of solidarity and international cooperation , in keeping with the growing interdependence observed world wide .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
The core of what the sponsors of the amendments thought was contained in amendment 7 , concerning the thirteenth preambular paragraph , which recognized " that the wishes of the peoples in the Territories with regard to their political status can be ascertained by referendums and other forms of popular consultation , including free and fair elections conducted by the Governments of the Territories .

The parties to those negotiations had agreed that permanent status issues should be covered at a later stage of the political process and they had recognized that some issues were so complex and sensitive that an interim period was needed before dealing with them . 
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;

The Committee 's deliberations therefore had to take account of the fact that the Organization 's political mandate needed to be coupled with effective funding based on realistic considerations rather than short-term assessments that would further weaken emerging democracies or the struggling economies of developing countries .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
While the social reforms the Government had attempted and the stoicism of the population were helping to maintain a relative measure of political stability , Belarus ' social problems , if left unresolved , could become a matter of concern for the entire international community .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .

Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .  
forthcoming Conference was part of the continuum of United Nations conferences that had begun at Rio , a continuum that was rewriting the economic , social and , perhaps , political agenda of the international community for the twenty-first century and was providing a more holistic and humane message about global problems and the solutions they required .  
was confident that the required support would be forthcoming and was optimistic about the outcome of the Conference , given the political support demonstrated thus far by national and local governments , organizations and people at all levels of society .  
States members of the European Union looked forward to the adoption at the Conference of a statement of principles and a global plan of action which promoted sustainable development through a participatory approach , reflected the positions of all involved in the negotiations and clearly set out the political messages on choices that must be made to meet the challenges at hand .  They reaffirmed their commitment to that objective .

erstwhile rivalry , sometimes violent , that had existed among the nine political parties formed during the struggle against the Soviet-backed Government , appeared to have changed into a conflict among three major armed groups : the Taliban , the forces controlled by General Dostum and his allies in the Supreme Coordination Council , and the government forces of President Rabbani .

convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 , of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Nations intervention should be confined to situations which posed an unquestionable threat to international peace and security and where Security Council decisions were based on the clearly expressed support of the majority of Member States , rather than on the political exigencies of a few States , no matter how powerful they might be .  
Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
included harmony among the various national groups and political stability based on the equal rights of all citizens , the unity of its multinational people and the resolution of all State issues through peaceful , democratic means .  
overwhelming majority of the world 's population lived in developing countries and for them , while political and civil rights were important , economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to subsistence and development , were paramount .  
She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
delegation was fully convinced that economic development alone was not enough to prevent humanitarian crises , and that political efforts were required to promote respect for human rights , the rule of law and responsible management of public affairs .  
PHAM ( Viet Nam ) said that Viet Nam had not been immune to the overwhelming refugee crisis which had affected the entire world and had worsened in recent years as a result of poverty , regional or internal armed conflicts , political , economic and social crises , violence and intolerance .  
Efforts to perfect Cuba 's political system and the rule of law had included the strengthening of constitutional rights and the enactment of a new election law providing for free , direct and secret parliamentary elections for the direct , popular nomination of candidates , without any need for political affiliation or party membership .  
considered that the main cause of the serious financial situation of the United Nations , which required a global and balanced solution , was the fact that certain Member States lacked the political will to discharge the binding financial obligations which they had assumed upon subscribing to the Charter .  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
In this context , the State seeks to modernize the kinds of measures taken by its public administration by gradually shifting its management and production actions towards a stronger public administration role in overseeing regulation and the proper functioning of economic mechanisms , in guaranteeing political and social stability and in protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society , in a spirit of social justice and rational solidarity .  
In this connection , it is appropriate to take into account the diversity of situations prevailing in each country in economic , social , cultural and political terms to appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative apparatus and then perhaps to suggest adjustments , since there can not be just one analytical criterion or just one model for good administration .  
Amid all these problems , the Government of National Unity installed on 19 July 1994 was faced with the daunting challenge of rehabilitating and rebuilding a war-ravaged economy , reviving the provision of basic social services to a traumatized population , coping with the wreckage of genocide , stabilizing a fragile political alliance , and consolidating internal peace and security , as well as warding off looming military threats from exiled soldiers of the former regime .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
The reform altered 65 of the Constitution 's 202 articles , with respect to individual rights ; the rights and responsibilities of and guarantees for the Nicaraguan people ; political and social rights ; the rights of the Nicaraguan family ; defence and the national economy ; agrarian reform and public finances ; education and culture ; the organization of the State ; municipal affairs ; and the Atlantic Coast communities . 
They have been declared entirely subordinate to the political Constitution as an apolitical , non-partisan , non-deliberative body obedient to civil authority ; mandatory military service has also been abolished .  
Just as Israel has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and free from threats or acts of force , as affirmed by Security Council resolution 242 ( 1967 ) , the territorial integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries should also be strictly respected , in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , including resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
On the question of the funding of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , of particular importance to developing countries is , first , the new appeal for a substantial increase in resources for these activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and for intensified efforts to mobilize the political will to achieve this .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
We are all aware that we live in an age when political decisions can be influenced by the emotional power of visual images , whose instant , worldwide transmission has been made possible by rapid-fire advances in everything from satellite technology to personal computers .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The representative pointed out some of the social , political and economic consequences of the events in her country , including physical , psychological , moral and spiritual destabilization of the population , total destruction of the structures of the State and an economy which is now dominated by humanitarian assistance .  
The Board 's analysis of country offices in the biennium established the common causes of unsatisfactory implementation as political instability , frequent changes in the leadership of implementing partners , delayed delivery of supplies , unrealistic project targets and late receipt of funds .  
This year 's international conferences HABITAT II , the World Food Summit and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have marked the completion of a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsored conferences which covered the full range of civil , political , economic and social issues that affect the peoples of the world .  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
Even when , as is more usual , the formal political boundaries remain intact , the ability of capitals of large and relatively homogeneous States to impose a single direction over all their constituent parts is clearly diminishing . 
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
The wealth of the Caspian Sea , its unique biological and mineral structure and fragile ecological system call for a comprehensive and balanced approach , free from short-term profit or political advantage .  
As we approach the next millennium and as the pre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the definition of national sovereignty , we must seriously question why a powerful minority is still allowed to bankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow economic and political needs .  
There is an urgent need to draw up and put into effect measures and strategies which , on the basis of international cooperation and shared responsibility , will make it possible to launch a comprehensive attack on this phenomenon and to do away with partial and subjective evaluations in rating the level of compliance of each Government in combating drug trafficking , or , still worse , in making use of this rating as a political weapon and pressure tactic .  
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States . Disarmament , sustainable development , enhancement of the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are priority issues that affect the security and well-being of peoples throughout the world .  
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .  
Belize has proposed that we should establish an annual special session of this Assembly immediately prior to the general debate , at which we would discuss development policy and regenerate the political will necessary continually to revise the complex Agenda for Development and the commitments made in this Assembly , as well as at the high-level global conferences of this last decade of the twentieth century .  
In this regard , I am pleased to note that my country enjoys excellent , long-standing diplomatic relations with the five permanent members of the Security Council and that it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement , whose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an expression of steadfastness in our convictions and in continued political cooperation . 
In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
Despite the new international situation that promotes less aggressive , less suspicious and less tense relations between States , the political instability that continues to exist in certain parts of Africa , and the conflicts that develop there , have become significant barriers to the economic recovery and social cohesion of the continent .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
Tunisia 's steadfast efforts to consolidate the foundations of the country 's political institutions and the rule of law and to promote and protect human rights in their global dimension flow from a civilized , irreversible choice made in accordance with universal values .  
Eager to ensure respect for human dignity and to encourage ongoing development efforts to secure the well-being of all citizens , Tunisia has been able to reconcile , in a balanced manner , economic growth with the preservation of political , economic and social rights , the requisite foundations of democracy .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
The economic and social gap between the nations of the world is still wide in spite of positive political and economic developments on the regional and international scene , the creation of economic blocs , and free trade in the world .  
It firmly declares the will of all political forces in Bulgaria Mr . Lukanov having been an active member of Parliament for the last seven years not to permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the path towards economic and political reform or to infringe on the peaceful and lawful process of political and public life , including the forthcoming presidential elections at the end of this month .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
To some extent , this phenomenon may be similar to that described as the emergence of the imprecise State , found in a wide variety of non-State political bodies or agents that have an international impact through the intricate network of non-governmental organizations and multinational political movements whose proliferation is another sign of the new interdependence , and which play an increasingly active role in the management of the world system .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
The calm , orderly and transparent holding of partial legislative elections on 4 and 18 August 1996 illustrates the resolve of the Togolese people , with the impetus of the Head of State , Mr . Gnassingbe Eyadema , to move forward along the road to democracy , peace and political stability , which guarantee social and economic development .  
The Blue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who provide political , economic , social and humanitarian assistance , thus contributing to the stabilization of situations and conflicts as well as to the search for a political settlement to conflicts through national reconciliation whenever necessary .  
Despite these efforts , which have continued for several years , this twofold response has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the ills that have slowed the progress and political , economic and social development of the human race .  
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
The characteristic distinction of the late twentieth century is that relations among nations are based on interrelated , mutual and diverse interests in various political , economic and social fields .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
It is a human , social , political and economic imperative for the international community and for all the actors and partners in development , in their own specific actions , to work responsibly for a more just and equitable framework for international trade , favouring a free and democratic economic partnership .  
The various summits that it has organized in recent years , coupled with its numerous activities covering the entire spectrum of political , social and economic spheres , in all corners of the world , is testimony to the critical role of the United Nations in resolving the national and international problems facing mankind .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
We would therefore be deeply appreciative if this understanding were translated into tangible results and if the subsequent technical discussions held following political consultations were much more fruitful .  
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
There is evidence the world over that continuing poverty , if not addressed adequately , will result in social disharmony and in economic and political disorder , and will become a threat to national and international peace and stability , thereby negatively affecting the growth and consolidation of democracy and human rights .  
In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , I stressed , on behalf of the Government of San Marino , the need to reconsider the instrument of the embargo , its effectiveness and repercussions , especially in those cases where , in the absence of armed conflict , international isolation alone has proved a valid moral and political means of international pressure .  
The Sudan is of the view that the structure of the international community , which is based on ideological , political and cultural diversity and pluralism , prompts us all to accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony and diversity among nations become the vehicle for interaction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing national interests in the context of the international system .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
Not only is this new Constitution the best we have ever had , but it also embraces the people 's political expectations for the advent of a true sense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of freedom , respect for human rights , and a strong nationalistic feeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of the world on a free and equitable basis . 
The consequent void of economic and political instability has provided an opening for many unscrupulous , self-proclaimed leaders who , hungry for power , are reigniting the myths , latent prejudices , hatreds and fears lying in the dark recesses of so many minds .  
Three months before general elections are to be held , the Government will demit office and hand over power to a non-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be headed by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the country and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities appointed on his advice , keeping in mind the sensitivities of the major political parties .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
At the same time , it was able to ensure political stability , improve security and engineer a rapid economic recovery , as reflected by a strong gross domestic product growth of 7.6 per cent , an inflation rate kept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of the national currency throughout 1995 .  
Yet , strengthened by his popular legitimacy and the support of a broad majority of the people of the Comoros , in six months President Taki drafted the broad outlines of political , economic and social reforms to overcome the numerous obstacles impeding the construction of a democratic , prosperous and interdependent society in the Comoros .  
We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources , a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and , on our part , clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies we shall , in due course , place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth .  
The present momentum for the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal should not be lost , but should be matched by commensurate political will to ensure that the work is completed in time for a conference in 1998 .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
Looking at current economic , social and political conditions on our continent , including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin , one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development .  
The United Nations will not be strong and effective if it allows cardinal principles of international law , such as respect for sovereignty , the territorial integrity of States and the right of States freely to choose their political , economic and social system , to succumb to unilateral political interests and the imposition of models .  
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
While the former limitations are constant , being structural , and in principle could be removed only at the cost of a distortion of the judicial function or a profound transformation of the political environment in which it is performed , the latter are reversible , but have the drawback of being extremely unpredictable . 
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
At the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen , our leaders committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
In order to implement commitment 2 of the Copenhagen Declaration , Mexico has accepted the imperative ethical , social , political and economic need to overcome poverty by taking vigorous action , with the main short-term objective of mitigating the effects of deficiencies and the long-term aim of establishing conditions for the sustained reduction of economic and social inequality .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation 's sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help to generate renewed political will at the national and international levels to attain the objectives of sustainable human development .  
Furthermore , to translate those promises into working realities , the General Assembly at its fiftieth session stressed , inter alia , the need for renewed , solid political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and their well-being so as to achieve the objectives of social development , and reiterated its call upon the world 's Governments to fulfil their commitments made at the Summit .  
The Social Summit expressed the political will to take advantage of a window of opportunity that has opened in the world with the end of the cold war to let in fresh air and to overcome the age-old ideological intolerance and rivalries of power politics , which were impediments to true international solidarity and served only selfish self-interest .  
If we think only of these two items , 194 trade union organizations asked by their central organ to promote the objectives of employment at the national level and more than 100 parliaments also resolved to take initiatives on the Summit , we realize how this process has been gaining ground in the political and main social sectors in our countries .  
Wilmot ( Ghana ) : At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , world leaders took tough political decisions and committed themselves to create an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve social development and social justice .  
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
There is a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction sometimes veiled and sometimes explicit with an Organization that still embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by the human spirit in the search for peace and understanding among peoples .  Brazil is committed to the United Nations Charter and to the Organization 's political , legal and diplomatic legacy of the past 50 years .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
The Italian proposal addresses and reconciles the two major changes that have occurred on the international scene since the end of the Second World War : first , the emergence of a group of countries with considerable economic and political capacities , including Italy , which by 1 January 1998 will be the fifth largest contributor to the United Nations budget ; and secondly , the emergence of the developing countries , which are far more numerous and important today than they were in 1965 , when the Security Council was enlarged .  
Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
The mid-term review of the implementation of this important political pact highlights not only the great sacrifices made by the African countries in introducing both structural and institutional reforms and the efforts of the international community to support economic recovery and social development in Africa , but also the long road that remains to be travelled to attain the main objectives of the programme .  
The social , economic and political circumstances and conditions in which African countries find themselves today , the loaded agenda for international cooperation for development , and the ongoing efforts to define a people-centred and environmentally acceptable road to economic growth and development , among other factors , lend a high degree of complexity to a process such as the one that has just been completed .  
Only a few weeks ago , the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) allowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved by African countries at the political , economic and social levels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the continent .  
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
Furthermore , Mexico reaffirms that , in strict accordance with the principles of international law governing relations among States , only Cuba , in the exercise of its inalienable rights , can determine as a free , sovereign and independent State its own political , social and economic system .  
That is , there should be systems of government with checks and balances , which guarantee the free exercise of the civil , political , social and cultural rights of the people , and which enhance the development of a free and dynamic society the only way to ensure harmonious and sustainable development .  
We are grateful to all Member States that supported our appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universal respect of international law as reflected , for instance , in General Assembly resolution 49 / 43 , which created the political conditions and legal framework for the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia .  
Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
The recent kidnapping incident appeared to put the peace process into question , but the Government as well as the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) clearly opted for peace , and we are pleased to note that partial agreements on pending issues such as the ceasefire , constitutional reform and the reintegration of URNG guerrillas into the political life of Guatemala will be signed in Oslo , Stockholm and Madrid respectively during the first half of December . We urge the parties to do their utmost to adhere to this programme . 
We are convinced that progress in the political and institutional areas in Central America can be consolidated only if they are accompanied by similar progress in economic development and by considerable reconstruction of the social fabric in those countries .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
Among the critical ones are ensuring the peaceful nature of political reforms ; establishing and consolidating domestic democratic institutions and standards ; restructuring ; and ensuring a social orientation that promotes economic transformation and is consolidated by a system of measures and safeguards to preserve social justice and protect society .  
In so doing , Japan deems it important to keep in mind in particular that in our present-day world , peace and stability can not be achieved and maintained solely on the basis of political and military factors , but that stable and durable peace can be realized only through efforts that take into account a wider perspective which comprises humanitarian concerns and social and economic reconstruction and development as well .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
In both Declarations , the international community recognized that no State has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other State , and that no State may use or encourage the use of economic , political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights or to secure from it advantages of any kind .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
This has caused discord in world thinking and created mutual suspicions that not only pose an overwhelming threat , jeopardizing the march of political progress and the activities of economic development as well as the fabric of social development , but also have raised questions as to whether the benefits of science and technology lead to world security and stability , or quite the opposite .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
Israel ought to have realized and accepted the fundamental truth that the key to its long-term security is not through the permanent occupation of neighbouring territories and the maintenance of a hawkish attitude towards its neighbours , but through the forging of a political compact with these neighbours .  
The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
While others were progressing , we were stagnating , locked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elements imported from the cold war , which arbitrarily kept in check for 40 years our political , social and economic evolution .  
The international response , however , will to a large extent remain insufficient if it is not reflected in concrete action in line with three requirements : the establishment of true international cooperation ; a show of greater solidarity ; and determination commensurate with regularly stated political commitments .  
It should be marked by a constant , unfailing mobilization of efforts to dismantle the criminal chain of terrorism , including those who are perpetrators , those who are behind them , the various political networks and their sources of financing and supply , and the direct or indirect logistical support given by individuals , groups or States .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
It is on that continent that we find the greatest expression of the categorical need for renewed and strengthened international solidarity in a spirit of open-mindedness and partnership to help African countries in their efforts at the socio-economic restructuring necessary to lay the foundations for lasting political and social balance and to open new prospects of hope for their peoples .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 50 / 39 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and facilitating the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
There was also a broad understanding between the concerned parties that the next step would be the formation of a political commission or a broad-based , fully representative council , although some differences still exist on composition and sequence , as well as on the issue of demobilization of armed militias , the collection of heavy weapons , demilitarization and the establishment of a national security force .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
It should have been removed from the agenda long ago on account of its negative political motive and in view of the fact that its substance is devoid of any subject not included in other resolutions .  
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
The general political climate prevailing in international relations is creating a set of circumstances that are favourable for the methodical pursuit of the work of disarmament , whose process of multilateral negotiations should be revitalized .  
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Recalling that the commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
" Recalling that the commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Despite continuing difficulties , a basis had now been laid for a qualitatively new political and psychological climate in the region that opened the way for the peaceful coexistence of Palestinians and Israelis and the attainment of specific results in the current negotiating stage , which was both complex and sensitive . 
The agreement , which recognized the sovereignty of Croatia over Eastern Slavonia and guaranteed the rights of the local Serb population , represented a major step forward , and the European Union wished to pay tribute to the moderation of the leaders involved on all sides and to the efforts of United Nations personnel , the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , and the personnel of other international organizations , who had all helped to bring about a political solution . 
One key objective of advocacy is to create a supportive and enabling cultural , social and political environment for reproductive health .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
We hope that the two parties concerned will put the interests of Croatian people of all ethnic origins above their differences , adopt a constructive approach , build mutual trust and implement the Basic Agreement in earnest so as to create conditions favourable for advancing the process of achieving a political settlement of the question of Croatia .  
While they are clearly assured of the support of UNTAES and the entire international community , it will be only through their political will and untiring efforts to reconcile and rebuild a harmonious multi-ethnic society that real progress can be achieved over the long term .  I should now like to turn to the other , technical draft resolution before the Council .  
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
The international community was taking a more balanced approach to the issue , which included economic , social and cultural rights along with civil and political rights .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to ensuring that women enjoyed all their human rights and that they were equal partners in shaping the economic , political , social and cultural development of their country .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
The Constitution contained provisions entitling women to remedial and affirmative action , with a view to enabling them to participate in political , economic and social life and gain access to positions in public and private institutions on an equal footing with men .  
With regard to the human rights of women , particularly the right to equal status , which was dealt with in the Beijing Platform for Action , he stressed that the first woman prime minister in the world had been elected in Sri Lanka and that the election of Mrs . Kumaratunga to the office of President by an overwhelming popular vote indicated that Sri Lankans accepted the role of women in political and social life and their holding the highest public offices .  
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .  
Responding to allegations that the armed forces of Myanmar had committed unseemly acts in border areas , he rejected them and insisted that the local population in those areas was experiencing unprecedented levels of progress in the political , economic and social fields and that the armed forces of Myanmar , which had a distinguished history and a fine tradition born of the struggle for independence , were well known for their good discipline and exemplary conduct .  
Such significant progress in political , economic and social conditions was contributing to an unprecedented quality of life for the entire population of Myanmar and not merely for the privileged few , as alleged by some critics .  
Iraq had repeatedly stated that a responsive environment and suitable economic and political conditions were essential to guarantee fundamental rights of the individual , which were the pillar of the Iraqi political and constitutional system .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
Owing to his personal prestige and his great political stature and vast political experience , President Mobutu is a true adept at regional , African and international affairs alike whether or not his detractors agree .  
Hence , to try to ostracize or marginalize a political leader of Mr . Mobutu 's stature a leader who , furthermore , heads so vast a country blessed with such exceptional resources , despite its temporary problems is both unrealistic and contrary to the norms of international law .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .  It was in that spirit that his delegation supported the appeal for new human and financial resources launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .  
Aware of the importance of a human rights culture and of the need to strengthen the democratic process , her Government had implemented a series of legislative , administrative and educational measures recommended by the advisory committee on human rights , a national body established in 1990 , which was composed of representatives of the entire political , social and religious spectrum of Moroccan society .  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
While the administrative restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights fell within the scope of the Fifth Committee , it was the task of the Third Committee to study the restructuring of policy , ensuring that emphasis was placed on economic , social and cultural rights , which were being neglected because priority was still being accorded to civil and political rights .  
and the Fourth World Conference on Women , 4 / within which it was noted that the family is the basic unit of society and as such should be strengthened , that it is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support , that in different cultural , political and social systems various forms of family exist and that the rights , capabilities and responsibilities of family members must be respected , E . 95 . XIII . 18 ) .  
The draft resolution failed to take account of the fact that no single political system or electoral process was suited to all nations and peoples and that political systems were subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
On the subject of participation by women in political life , she stated that female candidates were more successful in contests at the local level , where they were known personally to voters , although the proportion of women elected to municipal assemblies had fallen from approximately 30 per cent in the 1980s to only 16 per cent in 1990 . 
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Multiple frameworks generate confusion at both political and administrative levels about which frameworks prevail over others ; often compete for the small pool of highly qualified national personnel available to direct and implement the planning exercises ; and raise expectations about sectoral planning that are not achievable except through persistent commitment at the national and international levels . 
To support standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
LAMAMRA ( Algeria ) said that an independent and effective international jurisdiction must be established which would enjoy unquestioned moral authority and whose actions would be guided solely by the rule of law , far removed from the political influences that could pervert it .  
( a bis ) Support , through legislation , incentives and other means , where appropriate , organizations of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups so that they may promote their interests and become involved in local and national economic , social and political decision-making ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
The Republic of Tajikistan has consistently adhered to the policy of settling the inter-Tajik conflict through exclusively peaceful , political means and , in fulfilment of the hopes and aspirations of all citizens of Tajikistan for a comprehensive peace and calm in the country , is taking an active position at the inter-Tajik talks being held in Ashkhabad and is putting forward new and constructive proposals . 
A solution to the problems of personal security in the region will thus require a comprehensive and interrelated view of all aspects of sustainable development in Central America in its political , economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions ;  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
Progress in the political transition , for instance , the consolidation of new democratic institutions , the convergence of opinions in favour of the primacy of civilian authority , the normal conduct of elections , the emergence of new forms of representation of civil society and the national consensus surrounding the broadening of the political sectors incorporated in the Congress of the Republic .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,

Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
In general , desk officers and military mission officers deal with day-to-day operational and related political issues that affect the mandate and conduct of operations , as well as a broad range of other issues , which include military , logistical , administrative , humanitarian , electoral and legal issues .  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
Additionally , we note that at this time the National Police Force is not adequately trained or fully operational , which is a vital aspect for moving Haiti away from its turbulent past and pointing it in the direction of political stability , lasting democracy , constitutional order , economic prosperity and national reconciliation .  
The United Nations Mission in Haiti ( UNMIH ) has done a commendable job in assisting the Haitian authorities in sustaining a secure and stable environment , in organizing successful municipal and legislative elections and , above all , in managing the smooth transition from one democratically elected president to another no mean feat , given the tortured political history of Haiti .  
In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .  
The Government of Cuba has sound and undeniable proof , from the legal and political points of view , that the acts of violation and aggression against Cuban airspace perpetrated for more than 35 years , and most recently by aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " , have had a subversive , hostile , aggressive and terrorist character .  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Reiterating the urgent need for all concerned in Burundi , including extremists inside and outside the country , to make concerted efforts to defuse the present crisis and to commit themselves to a dialogue aimed at establishing a permanent political settlement and the creation of conditions conducive to national reconciliation ,  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Recalling further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Also urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;

Considering that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
Recognizing further that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda ,  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda , in a spirit of national reconciliation , to intensify efforts to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to create an environment conducive to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the voluntary and safe return of refugees to their homes ;  
It remained the principal producer of illicit opiates in the Golden Triangle of south-east Asia and the major source of heroin found in the illicit North American market in 1994 / 95 , taking advantage of favourable political developments , UNDCP assisted the Government in the elaboration of an alternative development project involving a minority group ( the Wa ) in northern Myanmar .  
The Minister of the Interior stated that the Sudan could possibly be more successful in its efforts to locate the suspects provided it received full cooperation from the relevant Ethiopian and Egyptian agencies and provided the matter was treated as a criminal case ; he added that , if the case was treated as a political issue , all efforts of the Sudan would be in vain .  
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
As may be seen , the United States authorities were perfectly aware of the existence of a group organized in the territory of the United States , equipped with aircraft and involved in carrying out activities inconsistent with the provision of international air services , which uses those aircraft for patently political purposes , disregarding Cuban sovereignty and also ignoring the regulations of the very State in which those aircraft are registered and where its pilots had obtained licences to operate them .  
All documented sources , including those of the information media and the international relief organizations , have confirmed that it is Uganda that provides support and that it is the major source arming the insurgency and supplying it with men and logistic , military and political support and providing transit access to all the forces and parties that are supporting the insurgency .

The course covers the protection of the human rights of women in all pertinent areas , encompassing civil , political , economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues of humanitarian law .  
Some delegations noted that the classical distinction into civil and political rights as justiciable , and economic , social and cultural rights as non-justiciable could , in the light of practice , case law and academic writings , no longer be maintained .  
Reaffirming General Assembly resolutions 50 / 173 of 22 December 1995 on the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education , 1995-2004 , and 49 / 184 of 23 December 1994 , in which the Assembly expressed the conviction that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social [ and of the right to development ] , 5 ter preambular paragraph .  
The aim is clear : it is to punish Cuba for seeking tenaciously to determine freely , sovereignly and independently its own political , economic and social organization ; for securing for its people a future of justice , free from foreign interference and petty interests such as those which , for more than 60 years , controlled the country under the protection of United States .  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
On 22 December 1995 , during the last plenary session of this first phase of the Ashkhabad talks , the delegation of the opposition unexpectedly declared that it would not consider it appropriate to renew the continuous round of inter-Tajik talks unless the heads of State of the Commonwealth of Independent States , at their scheduled summit in mid-January 1996 , clearly defined their position with regard to a political settlement in Tajikistan and supported that position with concrete acts .  
The Government of Guatemala considers that the foregoing reaffirms the mutual trust between the parties that characterizes the current phase of the negotiations , and reiterates its commitment to achieve as soon as possible a negotiated political solution to the internal armed confrontation , in order to strengthen the building of a firm and lasting peace .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Article 5 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that no law enforcement official may inflict , instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war , a threat to national security , international political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
A state of war ( in 49 countries ) , a threat of war ( in 46 countries ) , a threat to national security ( in 52 countries ) , internal political instability ( in 52 countries ) and other public emergency ( in 49 countries ) is not sufficient justification for torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
Continue to support the role of multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies in the provision of structured finance including loans and equity ; senior lender guarantees ; political risk insurance and re-insurance ; in the development of small supporting businesses , through soft loans ; and in the development of internal financial institutions through loans and guarantees and the introduction of stock exchanges etc .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
The normalization of the political situation , the restoration of mutual trust and the creation of viable mechanisms for ensuring lasting peace , stability and security are essential if these riches are to be used with maximum effectiveness for the benefit of all the peoples and all inhabitants of our region , and the advantageous transport and geographical conditions are to be fully exploited .  
However , the success of the policies followed depends on the underlying preconditions for private sector development , including stable and credible political conditions , law and order , and the continuity of policies which in themselves must be credible , consistent and transparent , as well as stable macroeconomic conditions .  
In accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 20 , the study covers a wide area , ranging from the licit to the illicit and from the bio-medical field to the economic , social , political and epidemiological fields .  
Throughout the long , grave political crisis , that brought my country to the brink of collapse , Haiti has committed itself to national reconstruction with a view to creating a State based on law and a democratic regime able to guarantee all of its citizens economic and social well-being .  
Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Meeting the challenge requires the allocation of commensurate resources by the international community and the maintenance of a strong collective political will , keeping in mind that no State can afford to be complacent in responding to organized transnational crime .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
According to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the term " discrimination against women " is used to denote all forms of discrimination , deprivation and restriction that prevents or eliminates or aims to prevent or eliminate the recognition , utilization and benefiting of women from all political , economic , social , cultural , civil and other fundamental rights and freedoms of human beings as based on the equality of the sexes and regardless of their civil status .  
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .  Its support staff will consist of 10 international and locally recruited General Service staff and 2 security officers .  
The Authority is doing this based on overwhelming popular support , which was crystallized in the historic election process conducted by the Palestinian people in January of this year , during which our people voiced their political choices clearly in favour of the peace process and gave a vote of confidence and constitutional legitimacy to the Palestinian leadership .  
At the same time , we wish to stress our belief that a complete and absolute solution to the problem of extremism and terrorism is linked to bringing an end to the unfair and unjust practices against our people , to the achievement of further political progress in the peace process and to improvements in the living conditions and the difficult economic situation of our people .  
The land incursion , sea blockade and air attack by Israel demonstrate once again its utter contempt for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon . By its action , Israel has violated not only the most basic principles governing relations between States , as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , which we all espouse , but also international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions , particularly resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
Provided effective support to standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
Finally , a sixth objective is to respond to the expressed need of the international community for the annual consideration , review and evaluation of continuing developments related to the law of the sea and ocean affairs in the General Assembly through the monitoring and analysis of and reporting on developments relating to the law of the sea and ocean affairs , including legal , political , economic , technological and scientific developments .  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
Promoting effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
The Copenhagen Programme of Action provides a rich source of ideas and practical suggestions that might constitute elements of effective national strategies that would command the required political support at national level , in full recognition of both the diversity of country situations and the need for coherent , organized efforts , with a clear purpose . 
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , at both the national and international levels , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food , and physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
The foreseeable developments in the international context - economic , political and institutional - following the Uruguay Round and the advance of regional and subregional integration agreements can offer some opportunities for countries whose productive and export-driven development has been retarded ; nevertheless , they also entail a significant erosion of the opportunities for implementing selective policies to promote such development .  
The fourth objective is to promote the establishment of regional institutional mechanisms to guarantee the full collaboration and participation of women in the main spheres of economic , political and social development .  
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
The Organization will be a central actor in this respect for the foreseeable future , not simply because of its role within the international community , but also because Africa 's problems encompass political , economic , social and environmental dimensions that require the integrated approach that only the United Nations can provide .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
The Acting Director commented that translating complex concepts which were condensed in one word , as in the case of " gender " or " empowerment " , required adequate understanding of the cultural , economic , religious , social and political circumstances of different countries . 
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
During the visit , I was able to meet with the local political leadership and express support for those who seek to implement the Peace Agreement and its vision of a single multi-ethnic country , two entities peacefully coexisting and elections that are free and fair .  
The course covers human rights protection of women in all pertinent areas , thus encompassing civil and political and economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues relating to humanitarian law .  
Recalling that the commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
In this connection , the Council pledges its continued political and material support for the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission entrusted with the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and invites the international community to participate actively in supporting the Commission 's efforts in every way possible in order to enable it to achieve its objective of placing the security and stability of the region on a firm foundation .  
Although at times difficult political , economic and technical problems had to be solved , common sense and the two sides ' commitment to their international obligations always won out .  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
The Ministers , without prejudice to their respective positions of principle regarding the political status of East Timor , continued their discussions on those substantive issues which have been identified related to an eventual framework for the achievement of a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor as well as other related issues , inter alia , the preservation and promotion of the cultural identity of the East Timorese people and bilateral relations between Indonesia and Portugal .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
As a result of resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , the fundamental rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its 21.3-million people to participate in international political , economic and cultural activities have not been respected and protected in the same way that the rights of peoples of other States have , and the stability in the region of the Taiwan Strait is also threatened .  
Papua New Guinea therefore urged those States that were members of the Committee and other States , including the administering Powers , to acknowledge the importance and usefulness of regional seminars as one of the most effective ways of assessing the political , constitutional , economic and social development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories . The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m . 
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
The third conclusion was that the underlying causes of the eruption of violent incidents and episodes had not been removed : political rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be suppressed and religious tensions and the immigration of Indonesians into the Territory were putting in jeopardy the cultural , religious and social identity of East Timor .  
We fully believe that through mutual good will , realism and observance of international commitments , the tendencies aiming at the maintenance of tension in the region will be defeated and a sound political decision in favour of peace and stability and our good multi-purpose relations with the fraternal Republic of Tajikistan will prevail , and no place will be left for the exchange of such notes where wisdom and common sense stand firm .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
Article 9.2 : " It is incumbent upon the public authorities to promote conditions which ensure that the freedom and equality of individuals and of the groups to which they belong are real and effective , to remove obstacles which prevent or hinder their full enjoyment , and to facilitate participation by all citizens in political , economic , cultural and social life . "  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
Two recent assessments for industrialized countries have included specified functions such as recreation , conservation , protection , hunting and grazing , and for each have shown the total forest area broken down into importance classes - high , medium and low .  It has also given a verbal account of " hot " political issues .  
The United States Secretary of Defense and Speaker of the House have recently intensified their campaign of disinformation and hostile propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by the reckless suggestion of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran respectively on National Public Radio on 2 August and NBC 's " Meet the Press " of 28 July - statements which represent blatant examples of political manipulation of public opinion already apprehensive about the recent tragic events . 
While an eco-regional approach may facilitate scientific understanding , it is widely recognized that there is a need to ensure early endorsement of recommended action by intergovernmental forums or major political groupings , since political and policy-level acceptance is a precondition for lasting national commitment and continued country-level implementation .  
Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
Democratic and pluralistic political systems have been established ; central planning and State controls have been dismantled : prices have been liberalized , most eastern European currencies are convertible , and consumers and producers are essentially free to make decisions according to their preferences .  
This is a sign that confidence in at least the medium run is being restored and that key institutional reforms , as well as a reasonable degree of macroeconomic and political stability , are being attained .  
Both at the eighth ministerial meeting at Yaound and at the Bureau meeting at Brazzaville , it was felt that while the primary responsibility for resolving the political and security problems in the Central African subregion rested with the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned , concerted action at the subregional and wider levels was required to promote lasting solutions .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
Realizing the increasingly important role of indigenous people and youth in solving the major problems facing humankind and the need to provide them with broader opportunities to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , cultural , spiritual and moral life of their peoples , as partners in development ,  
It is necessary for them to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , educational , cultural , spiritual and moral life as partners in the development of society .  
In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious intercommunity relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , [ in the framework of their beliefs ] * Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women and the girl child . 
In the spirit of cooperative linkages for joint exploration of human potentials , we agree to focus on partnership actions that clarify , interpret , create , protect and promote socio-legal , political , economic , educational , cultural , moral and spiritual processes affecting the abilities of indigenous people and youth to choose , maintain , access , encourage , manage and actualize their diverse ways of achieving just and humane growth and development .  
The process should build on national capacity and be based on the following characteristics , considering the situation of each country : well defined linkages to macro-level policies and policy processes ; closely linked cross-sectoral policies and issues , particularly land-use policies ; high-level political commitment and broad-based support ; participatory and decentralized planning approaches , including the use of local knowledge ; and identification and management of conflicts between relevant actors .  
The concept of national forest programmes should be considered as iterative and in permanent evolution in order to be fully efficient and adapted to changing economic , social and political situations .  
TAKING NOTE that the essential purposes proclaimed by the Organization of American States are , inter alia , to seek the solution of political , juridical and economic problems that may arise among them ; and to promote by cooperative action , their economic , social and cultural development ,  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
The United Nations will promote necessary measures to strengthen laws , policies and programmes that would ensure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life as equal partners and the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all women .  
But beyond those concrete achievements , the fact that all the Council 's decisions have been adopted by consensus , that all the Commissioners have also been appointed by consensus and that all their recommendations are unanimous and also approved by the Council by consensus , always without a vote , gives the Commission outstanding legal , political and moral authority . 
" We welcome the acknowledgement , by the Special Rapporteur , of the complexity and uniqueness of Brazil 's sociological context , in which economic , social , cultural , political and historic factors play a decisive role and contribute to explain the profound interbreeding of races - Amerindian , European and African . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The political maturity displayed during and after the general elections by Pierre Buyoya , who gracefully handed over power to the victor , was unceremoniously shattered once again , giving way to a difficult situation which has left the country fragmented and has compounded the problem of mistrust among conflicting parties .  
The military coup d'etat of 25 July last in Burundi was a violent act that flew in the face of established constitutional order , accelerated the spiral of violence and arbitrarily usurped political power to the detriment of democracy , national reconciliation and peace in that country .  
We urge them to find without delay the appropriate political mechanisms to make it possible to find a satisfactory solution to the crisis , with the understanding that only a broad and permanent political settlement providing for how the Government will be shared between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority can constitute the key element for establishing peace and harmony between Burundians , putting Burundi back on the path towards democracy and making possible international cooperation for reconstruction , development and the stability of the country .  
These include the unbanning of all political parties , the restoration of the National Assembly , the initiation of businesslike and unconditional negotiations between all political and military powers in the context of the mediation efforts pursued by former President Nyerere , guarantees for the security and safety of members of the former Government , the immediate cessation of all acts of violence , ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the targeted needy groups throughout Burundi and ensuring the safety and security of personnel of regional and international humanitarian agencies .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
The international community reached a consensus and committed itself to the goal of poverty eradication at the major United Nations conferences and summits of the 1990s , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative .  
While the United Nations system has an essential and complementary role to play in supporting Governments in their efforts to eradicate poverty , the primary responsibility for the assessment of poverty situations and for the formulation , strengthening and implementation of national poverty eradication plans and programmes lies with Governments and requires a strong political commitment at the national level .  
As an expression of their firm political will to employ all legal means to prevent , combat and eliminate terrorism , shall promote strict and timely compliance with applicable extradition treaties or , if appropriate , shall deliver the alleged perpetrators of terrorist acts to their competent authorities for prosecution , in accordance with their domestic laws , if sufficient legal grounds for doing so exist .  
Continuing the process of broadening national consensus , political forces and representatives of civil society in Panama gathered at the " Encuentro Panama 2000 " and pledged to keep issues relating to the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 outside partisan political considerations ; to reinforce the rule of law ; and to hold transparent elections in 1999 .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
The attitude and statements of the United States set a grave precedent in the history of international relations and run counter to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , Article 2 , paragraph 4 , of which reads : " All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations . "  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
UNICEF 's review of country experiences where remarkable social progress has been achieved shows that their common features include strong political commitment to the well-being of children , widespread community participation in the delivery of basic social services and the allocation of adequate resources to the cause of children .  
In any case , the Special Rapporteur has raised questions and issues which need to be resolved in the light of improved knowledge of the facts and specific reports and following a systematic analysis that will produce suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational criteria concerning mercenary activities .  
The Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Council in its resolution 11 ( II ) of 21 June 1946 to prepare recommendations and reports to the Council on promoting women 's rights in political , economic , civil , social and educational fields and to make recommendations to the Council on urgent problems requiring immediate attention in the field of women 's rights with the object of implementing the principle that men and women shall have equal rights , and to develop proposals to give effect to such recommendations .  
The Consultative Committee also approved a programme that enables UNIFEM to analyse , publish and disseminate findings and lessons learned from both its own work and experiences gathered in partnership with international , United Nations system , regional and national organizations and networks on promoting women 's political and economic empowerment .  
The situation of refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa has continued to be influenced by the harsh socio-economic realities of the continent and the related problems of the evolution of viable political institutions and processes based on democratic principles that will accommodate the diversity of cultures and the aspiration for peace , security and sustainable development .  
Considering the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations calling , inter alia , for the promotion of international cooperation in solving problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ,  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
Van der Stoel attempts to invoke the issue of missing Kuwaitis for obvious political purposes unrelated to human rights with a view to the continued exercise of pressure on the Government of Iraq and prolongation of the economic embargo and hence the suffering of the Iraqi people .  
If the enemies do not return our small submarine , survivors and the dead unconditionally while continuing to make ill use of the incident for the sinister political purpose , we will be forced to take strong countermeasures .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
In view of the sharp exacerbation of the crisis in Afghanistan , a meeting of the Security Council must be held immediately with the participation of the countries concerned for the purpose of drawing up urgent measures to halt the bloodshed , bring about a political settlement of the conflict and extend assistance to the civilian population and the numerous refugees .  
As already noted , the reduction of UNMIH 's military element necessitated a concentration of the remaining forces in Port-au-Prince ( see attached map ) , which , as the centre of economic , political and social activity in Haiti , is critical to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment .  
In this , the political leadership is also obliged to support and foster the development of both the formal human rights institutions that were established by the Peace Agreement and Federation Constitutions , and the informal non-governmental structures that are an integral part of the development of civil society .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
A permanent and independent electoral commission responsible for the conduct of elections would be an indispensable component of a neutral political environment in which parties , candidates and the public have maximum faith in the integrity of the electoral process .  
Periodic natural and man-made disasters and other adverse situations , including political instability and civil strife and problems of refugees and their attendant negative consequences , continue to imperil the fragile socio-economic conditions in many least developed countries .  
Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
His delegation believed that terrorism could be defined as the commission of acts of murder , assassination , bombing , hostage-taking or the seizure of aircraft or ships in order to provoke a state of terror for political purposes , whether by individuals or States and whether against other individuals or other States , in circumstances other than those of legitimate armed conflict for liberation from all forms of foreign domination or from colonial , occupying , racist or other forces , and , in particular , when undertaken by liberation movements recognized by regional and international organizations .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
This situation is particularly lamentable in the light of the fact that several States parties to the Convention are in possession of the financial and technical means to enable them to establish a system of rapid alert in regions where political situations are identified as being volatile .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .  
These populations can not be expected to return to their homes if the political systems and national laws to which they are subject fail to offer them reliable guarantees against summary executions , enforced disappearances , torture and unfair trials .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
On 11 April 1995 , the qualifications board of the Ignacio Agramonte lower secondary school dismissed \ x { 8072 } gel D \ x { 5adb } alo Machado from his post as a physics teacher for not participating in the activities of the escuela al campo ( a period of mandatory service by students in rural areas ) or in political activities , and for not paying dues to the official union .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
The relevant commitment , commitment 2 , reads , as adopted : We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
Experience in countries that have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which pay attention to the distribution of income and to investment in human resources through basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved , is fundamental to the eradication of poverty .  
In essence , the assumption of all governmental powers by SLORC in 1988 constituted , as mentioned earlier , a break from constitutionality and legal continuity and further constituted a departure from the norms governing the enjoyment of political rights proclaimed in article 21 of the Universal Declaration . There could , arguably , have been some legitimacy in the assumption of power by SLORC , without the consent of the people , in circumstances which could be said to have amounted to a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary General of NLD in her compound .  
Convinced that political rights can not be developed or preserved unless basic minimum economic and social rights are realized , since 7 November 1987 - the date on which President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali acceded to the Supreme Magistrature - Tunisia has worked continuously to promote and protect the full range of political , economic and social rights .  
Social consensus and ongoing dialogue are the basic rules governing relations between all the political , economic and social partners , reflecting the recognition that comprehensive development can not be fully achieved until the impoverished have gained access to the essential attributes of dignity ; a goal that can be achieved only by combatting all forms of destitution and marginalization and making enhanced solidarity among all members of the national community an essential basis for all the reforms introduced .  II .  
From the abolition of slavery to the prohibition of practices - less brutal , but more subtle - used for purposes of political coercion or in so-called social education and prevention programmes , ILO 's international action to combat forced labour has been marked by a constant concern to ensure that persons work of their own free will .  
The latter convention calls for the immediate and complete abolition of forced labour in the following five forms : as a measure of coercion or political education ; as a measure of mobilization for purposes of economic development ; as a sanction for having participated in strikes ; and as a measure of racial , social , national or religious discrimination .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation called for urgent and immediate generation of political will in the international community to follow up and implement the recommendations of recent United Nations conferences , in particular commitments to new and additional financing for development and creation of a favourable international economic environment , inter alia , through transfer of technology and enhanced trade access of products from developing countries .  
The most positive and promising development during the period has been the dialogue and agreements at the political level between the Commission and the Government of Iraq leading to mutual undertakings on such crucial issues as access to sites for inspection and interviews as well as to the establishment of a joint programme of action , containing an outline of priority tasks to be accomplished , as originally proposed in the Commission 's April 1996 report to the Security Council .  
It was emphasized that there is no bureaucratic leadership at the top level within the system , which means that " the political system created is not an organization , but all the powers ( legislative , executive and judicial ) together , there is no budget allocated to this system ( enacted bodies are financed by self-resources by the constituency ) , there is a face-to-face democracy , that is a free gathering of all citizens in different neighbourhoods , citizens who enjoy full equality of their rights " .  
These constants are : ( a ) It was made clear to the Special Rapporteur during all the meetings he held with representatives of the Government of the Sudan at the highest level that the political agenda of the Government will not change : the principles and the basic regulations laid down in constitutional decrees 1 to 13 as amended , will be strictly observed in the policy-making process and no change will be made to these principles and basic regulations . 
It was said that the forum should have a broad mandate and that it should extend beyond a narrow human rights focus to include issues such as economic , social , cultural , political , civil , educational and developmental issues as well as play a role in the coordination of all relevant United Nations activities .  
Despite being forced to devote a large part of its human and material resources to defending its land and people against the expansionist policies of Israel , the Syrian Arab Republic had undertaken a comprehensive and successful social development programme .  The leadership provided by the President had ensured the political stability and democratic climate necessary for broad participation in youth-related activities .  
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
Together with the agreements already signed , this Agreement seeks to create the conditions for genuine reconciliation among the people of Guatemala , based upon respect for human rights and the diversity of its peoples and on their shared determination to overcome the lack of social , economic and political opportunities , which undermines democratic coexistence and restricts the development of the nation ,  
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
The right to development is related to all human rights but can not be identified with the sum of the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights or be confused with development itself .  
Key concerns addressed in the process - as discussed in detail in the first report - are political legitimacy , accountability and transparency ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; bureaucratic accountability ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
" The inhuman Israeli practices include the various material , political , cultural and social situations of the Arab citizens in the occupied region of the Syrian Arab Golan , not to mention the continuity of settlement policy , advancing to the Arab territories , destruction of building , theft of antiquities , investment and seizure of lands , natural resources and water sources . "  
Building increased public awareness of the social , economic and human costs of anti-personnel mines is essential to develop and sustain the necessary political will for a global anti-personnel mine ban .  
In Haiti , although there is no direct technical cooperation related to a specific project , close and regular coordination is maintained at a political level .  
The Committee also agreed with the Secretary-General 's view that efforts to ensure that the United Nations was equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century depended on , above all , continuous , predictable and assured political and financial support from Member States .  
The Serbian authorities are continuing their campaign of State terror through , to mention only a few forms , killing and torturing of Albanians , raids of homes throughout Kosova , illegal arrests and systematic persecution and maltreatment of political and human rights activists , imprisonment of people because of their political convictions , systematic and continued campaigns to destroy the Albanian cultural heritage , including by halting education in Albanian and crushing the efforts of the Albanians to preserve their identity in Kosova .  
Liberal International stated that it supported the rights of minorities by establishing formal or informal relations with minority organizations and their political parties , providing education and training , a platform for exchange as well as links to the Council of Europe , the United Nations and other international bodies , and assisting in raising awareness of minority issues at the international level .  
The Programme is conceived as a necessary global commitment and a major coordinated effort of the various national and international actors to develop and implement more than 300 top-priority renewable energy projects of national , regional and international value within a 10-year period in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility , economic viability and social and political acceptability of solar energy .  
On a different level , it is of fundamental importance that places of worship should be reserved for religious , non-political uses , that the legal system governing political parties should be defined in such a way as to avoid political variables impinging on religious constants , and that schools should be protected from all ideological , political or partisan indoctrination .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The rule of law is understood as a human right in itself but also as essential means for the protection of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
Starting in 1995 , political and economic transition in Mozambique has shown promising signs of a return to stability and normality : peace , national reconciliation and the vitality of the young democracy have taken root ; parliamentary performance improved noticeably ; one has witnessed an open , free and lively interface between government , legislature and media ; overall the social climate remained calm ; resettlement of internally displaced people and returning refugees was consolidated ; reintegration of demobilized soldiers has been relatively free of major disruption ;  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
The integrity of the statistical institution ( i.e . , whether it operated under a published statistical law and independently of political interference ) , the transparency of the statistical production and dissemination process , and public and equal access to information were three important concerns for winning the trust of users in official economic statistics .  
Women 's empowerment at the national , regional and global level required a multidimensional approach in the cultural , economic , political and social fields .  
At the regional level , the Economic Commission for Africa played a leading role in assisting Member States in their implementation of the Platform , focusing human and financial resources on enhancing women 's political leadership role and economic empowerment and promoting their legal and human rights .  
That was due to a number of factors , including sociological attitudes which perpetuated the domination of women ; illiteracy among women ( 91 per cent of women were illiterate ) ; the fact that women 's roles , needs and responsibilities were not seriously taken into account in economic and social development policies ; the priority accorded to technical solutions to women 's problems ; and the marginalization of women in political bodies , even though women represented a vast proportion of the electorate .  
The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1072 ( 1996 ) of 30 August 1996 , in which the Council decided to re-examine the question of Burundi on 31 October 1996 and requested me to report by that time on the situation in Burundi , including on the status of the immediate and unconditional negotiations which the Council required all of Burundi 's political parties and factions without exception , whether inside or outside the country and including representatives of civil society to initiate , with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement .  
We are hopeful that the coming consultations will overcome these obstacles and embody the political will expressed by the leaders of the world during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as their affirmation that the expansion of the Security Council is a basic condition for making its membership more representative and its working methods more transparent .  
Permanent membership for these regions should be considered not only in order to ensure equitable geographical distribution , but also because countries from these regions have significant political and economic influence and have played a constructive role in international affairs , including peacekeeping .  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in the international political and economic arena Germany and Japan for example as well other influential countries in regional and global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council . 
Fed with misinformation from unscrupulous sources and armed groups that are in opposition to the Government , blinded by prejudice and preconceived notions and motivated by ulterior political reasons , some countries regrettably continue to make unfounded accusations . 
The Government can not accept any disruption of the ongoing political process and , having been fully aware of all the subversive activities going on clandestinely , was constrained to take preventive action against the sinister moves of NLD , which were apparently made in concert with the subversive elements , by bringing in the members of NLD temporarily for questioning .  
As security and political problems are directly tied to economic and social issues , the international community should enhance coordination between the Security Council and the other main organs of the United Nations , especially the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the International Court of Justice , so as to ensure their effective participation through political and legal consultations to enable a flow of information between them .  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
The European Union believed that the medium-term plan should reflect the political parameters established at the recent global conferences , promote their integrated implementation and assess the organizational needs , including the administrative and budgetary resources required to facilitate the implementation of the commitments undertaken . 
The problem lay in the grey areas and the limits that had to be set to prevent such advisers from becoming active in internal armed conflicts or in internal security affairs that affected the exercise of internationally recognized civil and political rights and freedoms .  
Such issues had to be resolved in the light of a better knowledge of the facts and a systematic analysis of political , legal and operational criteria applicable to mercenary activities .  
Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
He was convinced that , in the framework of a free democratic process , federalism and national and cultural self-determination , and not through violence , separatism and extremism , peoples could reaffirm their political status in addition to ensuring their economic , social and cultural development and well-being .  
Bearing in mind that Western media allegations of Libyan terrorism had proved false , his delegation joined with those which had stressed the need to draw up a code of conduct concerning the media and information with a view to reinforcing the ground rules for fairness and impartiality and respect for the choices of peoples relating to lifestyle and to political , economic , social and cultural development .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .  
Precisely because information could have such a profound influence on the political , social and moral development of societies , it was vital that societies set benchmarks for what was unacceptable and define the parameters of the acceptable .  
The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
It should be noted , however , that economies in transition are also far from being homogenous , reflecting differences in levels of economic development , enterprise culture , infrastructural and educational base , pre-communist economic and social patterns , geographic location and most of all the degree of the use of market mechanisms prior to the change in their political systems .  
This singling out of the Jehovah 's Witnesses is almost certainly due to their religious militancy , which is expressed through proselytism , conscientious objection to military service and a variety of public demonstrations which call into question the interests of the dominant Church and the legislative and political system of the State .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
On the subject of Afro-Colombian communities , Act No . 70 of 1993 reaffirmed the political , economic , social , cultural and territorial rights of such groups and protected their lifestyle as a development option based on their own logic and experience , in conditions of equality , equity , autonomy , participation and respect for cultural differences . 
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .  
The main reason for the unregulated status of hundreds of thousands of permanent residents of Latvia and Estonia of non-Latvian and non-Estonian origin is the legislation of those countries on the basis of which those persons have arbitrarily been deprived of their citizenship and have been declared to be aliens in their own countries of residence whose fundamental political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights are thus being curtailed .  
Also commends the work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women in providing a strategic and focused response to the follow-up and implementation of the Platform for Action through its advocacy and operational activities in support of women 's economic and political empowerment , and encourages the Fund to provide technical support to operationalize the Platform for Action at the national level through , inter alia , the resident coordinator system , and taking into account decision 1996 / 43 of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme / United Nations Population Fund ;  
According to numerous non-governmental observers , the authorities had usurped the religious sphere , claiming that they alone were in possession of divine truth , and had perverted religion by politically exploiting Islam in order to secure their grip on power and enforce their authority through religious and political persecution and totalitarian methods , in complete contrast to the historically tolerant Muslim heritage of the Sudan .  
On the question of dress , the Special Rapporteur , while emphasizing that traditions and customs , irrespective of their origins , are equally worthy of respect , urges that dress should not be the subject of political regulation and calls for flexible and tolerant attitudes in this regard , so as to allow the variety and richness of Sudanese garments to manifest themselves without constraint .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Although significant progress had been made in the field of human rights , particularly in the eradication of apartheid and the adoption of conventions protecting the human rights of women and children , the enjoyment of political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights was far from being universal , and it was regrettable that the end of the cold war had not brought about an improvement in the situation .  
In discharging its human rights obligations and in its approach to human rights in general , Egypt adhered to a number of principles : the politicization of human rights and their use as an instrument to achieve political objectives must be avoided ; double standards must not be applied to human rights situations ; full account must be taken of cultural differences in the context of human rights issues ; and human rights , including social , economic and political rights and the right to development , were indivisible .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
The Human Rights Committee , after having considered the initial report of Estonia ( CCPR / C / 79 / Add . 59 ) in October 1995 , had expressed satisfaction at the fundamental and positive changes in Estonia , which provided a better political , constitutional and legal framework for the implementation of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
In assuming its complete role , with the completion of AICC construction work , the detention facilities , increased activity with the commencement of trials , and taking into consideration the general political situation of the region , additional security personnel would be required for facilities and access control , armed escort , personal protection and simultaneous courtroom operations .  
The measures imposed on the Bosnian Serb party were suspended indefinitely starting on 27 February 1996 , after the Security Council was informed the day before , through the appropriate political authorities , that , in the assessment of the commander of the Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bosnian Serb forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation established in the Peace Agreement ( letters to States and international organizations , SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2 ) and SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2-1 ) ) ;  
We appeal to the parties concerned to cease immediately all hostile actions , ensure the safety of the lives and property of refugees and innocent civilians and guarantee the smooth delivery out of international humanitarian assistance so as to create conditions for the voluntary and orderly repatriation of the refugees and lay the foundation for a political settlement in the Great Lakes region .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Despite considerable economic difficulties , her Government was determined to preserve those achievements and to bring about economic , social and political renewal based on a market economy , social justice , the rejection of any form of marginalization or exclusion , and the establishment of a durable democratic system .  
Refuting the so-called reliable sources of the Special Rapporteur as being linked to other States or in the pay of the United States secret services , the representative of Iraq said that the accusations concerning the violation of the political and civil rights of the Iraqi population by means of laws imposing cruel and inhuman penalties , which those sources had reported , were totally groundless since those laws had been repealed , as the Centre for Human Rights and other international bodies could confirm .  
BOHAYEVSKY ( Ukraine ) said that the international protection and promotion of human rights could be effective only if it was based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
Adopting a presumptuous , arrogant and biased approach to the question of human rights , pursuing double standards or politicizing the issue in a deliberate attempt to provoke political confrontation would harm the promotion and protection of those rights .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Given the increasing interrelationship between political , economic , social , military and cultural factors in conflicts , the concept of peacekeeping had been modified and had acquired a multidimensional and integral character .  
While it was neither desirable nor feasible to adopt inflexible procedures for all peacekeeping operations , such operations must be guided strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular , respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs .  
It is committed , independent of extreme events , to combat racism and xenophobia over the long term , producing publications ( brochures , posters and pamphlets ) every year on symbolic dates such as 21 March ( International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ) , 3 October ( German Unity Day ) and 10 December ( Human Rights Day ) , suggesting action to be taken , engaging in public relations , through statements in the press , on current topics , and submitting petitions and claims to political bodies .  
Planning to meet requirements and the design and erection of decent and socially acceptable lodgings represents an extremely complex and expensive task inasmuch as , to cope with the problem of refugees arriving in unpredictable numbers , with major peaks , account has to be taken of economic possibilities and of the limited land areas and premises available , while also avoiding conflicts with the population and among the refugees themselves and taking into consideration local political interests .  
The economic crisis , on the one hand , and the identity crisis , on the other , are aggravated by the claims of people of French stock to ascendency over naturalized French citizens and immigrants ; hence the reference to the theme of national preference , with its xenophobic and even racist content , in political speeches .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
The Government and Brazilian society were resolved to work together to ensure full enjoyment of civil , economic , social and cultural rights , as well as political freedom , which was essential to improve the standard of living of the population .  
Regrettably , where alleged violations of minority rights occurred , political means were frequently resorted to and there was an insufficient use of judicial protection mechanisms at the national level , which should be exhausted before any recourse was had to the relevant international organizations .  
REZVANI ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) said that regional institutions and instruments played a key role in the promotion and protection of human rights , and were capable of reflecting regional political , social , cultural and economic factors .  
The Chinese Government , while committing itself to the promotion of economic development , had strengthened the country 's democracy and legal system , with special attention to economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights .  
The civilian component of the mission , acting under the broadened political mandate thus granted to my Special Representative , has assisted in bringing together various segments of the population in an effort to promote mutual understanding between communities , monitor human rights and ease political and inter-ethnic tensions within the country .  
These expressions of concern notwithstanding , an active electoral campaign was conducted by all major political parties , including those that had boycotted the second round of parliamentary elections held two years ago .  
Nevertheless , the period of time covered in his report ( A / 51 / 457 ) was very long and many of the matters referred to had already been resolved , as reflected in reports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Central America and on the progress made in the political , economic and social fields , particularly by the efforts to improve the judicial system , public security mechanisms and human rights institutions .  
The purpose of the United Nations internship programme is to promote among the participants ( usually students enrolled in a graduate school ) a better understanding of major problems confronting the United Nations ; the programme also provides departments , at Headquarters and elsewhere , with the assistance of outstanding young students specializing in a relevant field , such as economics , social affairs , international law , international relations , human rights , political science , or public administration .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Also commends the work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women in providing a strategic and focused response to the follow-up and implementation of the Platform for Action through its advocacy and operational activities in support of women 's economic and political empowerment , and encourages the Fund to provide technical support to operationalize the Platform for Action at the national level through , inter alia , the resident coordinator system , and taking into account decision 1996 / 43 of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme / United Nations Population Fund ;  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
There could be no peace without development , and peace could not be based solely on economic and political agreements between Governments ; rather it should be based on mankind 's intellectual and moral solidarity , which in turn was based on the cultural dimension that transcended national borders and promoted mutual understanding .  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;

Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Rejects coercive extraterritorial measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women and the elderly ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
He wondered why the United States Government used double standards , accusing some countries of human rights violations , while turning a blind eye to those committed by some of its allies and ignoring the thousands of political detainees and shielding the killing of unarmed women and children and the occupation of foreign territory as it made use of its veto .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .

I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
" Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect fundamental human rights in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,

During the Habitat II process there was renewed political commitment to the implementation of new or revised national shelter policies based on the enabling approach , as there is growing recognition that better policies not only improve housing conditions but also increase the impact of the housing sector on local and national economies .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
CHAVES ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that desertification and drought were global problems caused by the interaction of topographical , biological , cultural , political , social and economic factors . 
" Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , " Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,

Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

While it remains committed to its decision , taken in response to the proposal of the governments of a number of friendly countries , notably the Russian Federation and France , to give political action a chance to remedy the situation with respect to the unlawful no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , the Government of Iraq has sought to inform you of the facts of the matter so that the international community may be aware of the dangers posed by the continued maintenance of the no-flight zones to security and peace in the region . 
On behalf of the authorities of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been forced to leave their native place , allow me to express our deep gratitude to the United Nations , the Security Council and personally to you , Your Excellency , for the tireless efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia , Georgia , in particular , for the firm and clear position taken by the United Nations towards the illegal parliamentary elections held by the present separatist leadership on 23 November 1996 .  
Another view was that the concept of crimes in international law was well established and that for acts of exceptional gravity such a characterization with its legal , moral and political dimensions and negative and condemnatory connotations was quite appropriate .  
Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara . ( c ) ) or the requirement not to derogate from basic human rights , had been generally well accepted .  
Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .  
With regard to the fact that the rules on reservations to multilateral treaties had been elaborated with the purpose of reconciling two sets of interests ( the need to ensure the universality of a treaty by maximizing participation by States with diverse cultural , economic and political conditions , and the need to preserve the integrity of the treaty ) , it became evident that universality should not only be numerical but also substantive .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
His delegation supported in part the approach followed by the Commission in its previous sessions , namely , to retain only those crimes whose gravity could not easily be contested , as well as crimes of a clearly political nature which posed a threat to international peace and security and therefore to exclude crimes , such as piracy , trafficking in women and children , racial discrimination , recruitment of mercenaries and foreign intervention .  
The observation of the Special Rapporteur in paragraph 68 that " a great reluctance of the international community to use the term ' genocide ' " is not rooted , as the Special Rapporteur would like it , in the alleged " reluctance " but in the fact that such a position is contrary to international law , while the prevailing practice of certain political bodies and some United Nations Special Rapporteurs to invest genocide with arbitrary definitions has been politically motivated .  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
While retaining its great ability for political and financial mobilization and intensive , joint work with Governments , UNICEF , under the excellent leadership of Ms . Carol Bellamy , and with a renewed mandate , is focusing on supporting Government efforts to settle outstanding issues , consolidate the gains that it has already achieved and work more effectively to meet present and future challenges . 
The extension of UNAVEM 's mandate until 28 February 1997 will provide the Angolans with an additional chance to accomplish the remaining military and political tasks foreseen in the Lusaka Protocol and to establish the basis for a peaceful , united and prosperous Angola .  
A comprehensive approach to education for human rights , including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and recognizing the indivisibility and interdependence of all rights , as defined by the United Nations , shall be adopted for all activities under the Decade .  
In order to enhance their effectiveness , human rights education efforts for the Decade shall be shaped in such a way as to be relevant to the daily lives of learners , and shall seek to engage learners in a dialogue about the ways and means of transforming human rights from the expression of abstract norms to the reality of their social , economic , cultural and political conditions .  
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
According to its statute , the members of the Commission were elected , not on the basis of political representation , but so as to represent the main forms of civilization and principal legal systems of the world , in addition to which its members must of course individually possess the requisite qualifications of competence in international law .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
As I left the region , attention was already shifting from the humanitarian crisis to the political situation in Zaire and its potentially turbulent effects on an already fragile and volatile region ; hence the repeated calls by all the African leaders for the absolute need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Zaire . 
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
Hence , at this critical stage , my delegation deems of utmost importance the respect for the principal provisions of the peace accord , such as cooperation with the International Tribunal , leading to the arrest , extradition and trials of those responsible for atrocities ; the resettlement of refugees to their homes of origin , free from harassment and discrimination ; the rapid establishment and functioning of the new political institutions ; and respect for the arms-control provisions of the peace plan .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The Conference identified as a major catalyst the political will of the leadership to champion the cause of scientific and technological development in Africa and to provide it with appropriate policies , financial and other resources and an enabling environment .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .  
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
The constant growth of crime , with its dangerous new forms and transnational dimension , in many parts of the world represented a destabilizing threat to fundamental social , economic and political institutions , especially of those countries in transition , and endangered international security .  
PASHAYEV ( Azerbaijan ) said that drug abuse , illegal drug trafficking and crime were increasing at alarming rates and had serious political , economic and social implications for countries , particularly the newly independent States , which had been confronted with problems resulting from aggression , large numbers of refugees and displaced persons , economies in transition and a geographical situation favourable to drug dealers .  
In that context , she felt it was important that the terms " organized " and " transnational " crime should not be used to describe controversial political ideas , but restricted to agreed social and legal dimensions .  
The Government of Guatemala reiterates that the incorporation of URNG in the political and legal life of the country , under conditions of security and dignity , is in the national interest , given that it is directly related to the objective of reconciliation and the consolidation of a democratic system open to all , and to the contribution of all Guatemalans in building a prosperous country , a just and equitable socio-economic system and a multicultural , multiethnic and multilingual nation ,  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
Ukraine had always supported the creation of an international criminal court and was ready to participate actively in the future work , in the hope that the international community would demonstrate enough political will to meet what was an historic challenge .  
It had been agreed , in the preliminary exchanges of views , that the Working Group 's visit could with advantage be preceded by a preparatory visit so that , firstly , the Group could more easily take cognizance of certain constraints , political or technical ( for example the problem of distances ) , facing such a visit and to have a better understanding of Chinese law , in particular with regard to the difficulties entailed in bringing it into conformity with the international instruments on human rights .  
The remaining issues could be divided into two categories : the procedural or technical ones could be addressed during the nine weeks of further work recommended by the Preparatory Committee ; and the substantive issues requiring high-level political decisions could be finally resolved only at the conference .  
His delegation recognized the major technical difficulties involved in the constitution of such a court , which involved striking a careful balance between procedural concepts and political interests , and ensuring that both the procedural rights of the accused and the right to justice of the victims and the international community were taken into account .  
Although his delegation acknowledged that the obstacles to its inclusion were more political than legal , it considered that the task assigned to the Preparatory Committee and the court itself would be incomplete if such a core crime were not included in the statute of the court .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
They also have been asked by many States engaged in democratization to help encourage and facilitate the active participation of citizens in political processes , and to foster the emergence of a productive civil society , including responsible and independent communications media .  
Traditionally , technical assistance has been provided in the context of economic and social development , with the main emphasis on building and strengthening physical infrastructure and the executive arm of the Government ; assistance in governance beyond that was made virtually impossible by the political climate throughout most of the United Nations history .  
Such a culture is built upon a societal consensus not about policy , but about the process and framework of democratic political life : that the will of the people is the basis of governmental authority ; that all individuals have a right to take part in government ; that there shall be periodic and genuine elections ; that power changes hands through popular suffrage rather than intimidation or force ; that political opponents and minorities have a right to express their views ; and that there can be loyal and legal opposition to the Government in power . 
The reality is that no State can long remain just or free , and thus also have the potential to pursue a successful and sustainable development strategy , if its citizens are prohibited from participating actively and substantially in its political processes and economic , social and cultural development .  
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
Legal , economic , political or cultural barriers that prevent the exercise of equal rights should be identified and removed through comprehensive policy reforms and strong affirmative action ;  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
Cuba considers that the unfair and unequal international political and economic order , underdevelopment , the unequal distribution of income among countries and within countries and , in some cases , the actions of other States and the implementation of measures of coercion are also responsible for the outbreak and continuation of internal conflicts and the suffering they cause .  
In Cuba , freedoms and fundamental political , economic , social and cultural rights are established by the Constitution , as is equality of rights , and they are all provided for in the main legal texts in force .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
The world community must send a clear signal to the warring parties immediately to halt all hostilities , refrain from the use of force , set aside their differences and engage in political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation , a lasting political settlement to the conflict and the establishment of a completely representative and broad-based transitional Government of national unity .  
The new , restructured MINUGUA will oversee an unprecedented transformation in the political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security life of Guatemala .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
The cooperation between UNHCR and SADC will focus , inter alia , on the social , economic and political issues in the southern African region that have a bearing on the root causes of forced population displacement , refugee protection , provision of humanitarian assistance and the search for durable solution .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
It recognized that the Declaration on the Right to Development constituted an integral link between the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action through its elaboration of a holistic vision integrating economic , social and cultural rights with civil and political rights .  
In retrospect , the victories of the people , first against the political sleight of hand to stop the elections , and then against the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare away the voters from the polling booths , seem to have left the reactionary forces in our country with only one remaining avenue to their objective , the unconstitutional overthrow of any civil Government , and that was precisely what happened on 25 May . The people of Sierra Leone have responded to the coup in a manner unique in the history of Africa .  
With the improvement of the international political climate , the dangers posed by nuclear war and the arms race are receding , while prospects for taking concrete steps on practical disarmament are improving .  
Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of its armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest possible level and of ensuring its independence and national security primarily by political and diplomatic means .  
The agreement expands cooperation to new fields , such as preventive diplomacy , the maintenance and consolidation of peace and , pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 50 / 3 , all subjects of common interest in the political , economic , social , scientific and cultural fields .  
Many times during the biennial conferences held since 1986 the Heads of State and Government of countries that use French as a common language one country out of four in the world have recognized the role of multilateralism in the new international context and confirmed their will to help find a solution to global political and economic problems .  
In preparing for the special session the Governments of Member States should demonstrate their political will in practical terms by intensifying their efforts to eliminate poverty in general , eradicate absolute poverty , increase employment and decrease unemployment and by deepening social integration in their respective countries .  
The General Assembly would express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the OIC and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two Organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ; and would express the hope that the Secretary-General will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two Organizations .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
The Bucharest document identified an almost universal recognition that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to political , economic and social problems .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
In keeping with this view , the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that democracy is not a model to be copied but a goal to be attained , and the pace at which it can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture and society .  
Mongolia agrees with the conclusion that democracy is not a model to be copied or imposed , but rather a goal to be attained , and that the pace at which democratization can proceed is dependent on a variety of political , economic , social and cultural factors proper to the circumstances of a particular culture or society .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
Efforts to experiment with introducing new forms of democratic process to provide people with a choice of their elected representatives at the municipal or local level in certain countries deserve our notice and appreciation , if we are sincere about recognizing different historical traditions in the evolution of democratic political practice .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
In his annual report on the work of the Organization ( A / 52 / 1 ) , the Secretary-General considered that post-conflict situations have special requirements and that successful recovery from disturbances caused by conflicts is assisted by facing up quickly to general development challenges , and the provision of appropriate legal frameworks , stable social and political environments and economic opportunities .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
In the spirit of Olympic ethics , any form of discrimination racial , religious , political , linguistic or otherwise is totally excluded , and the fundamental principle of equality prevails .  During the last three millenniums the Greek people have remained wholeheartedly and deeply committed to the Olympic Ideal , founded on the noble principles of understanding , tolerance , solidarity and dignity .  
In our view , special attention should be paid in the charter to the security interests of States that have not joined military and political alliances and have not expressed the desire to join such alliances in the foreseeable future .  
The time has come for us all to display the necessary political will and determination in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive set of measures which will lead to the creation of a Security Council which is transparent , democratic , accountable and thus credible and legitimate .  
Escaping this state of mind and building a new world based on cooperation and the rule of law requires not only political will , but careful planning in order to foster confidence and to mitigate economic , security and social concerns at national and regional levels .  
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
The prolonged cycle of violence and hostilities , as a direct consequence of Israel 's continued illegal occupation of Arab territories , has brought tremendous political , economic and social sufferings and hardships to the people of the region , including the loss of human lives .  
It has been recognized in all international legal and political forums that East Jerusalem is an organic part of the West Bank occupied since 1967 and that the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , applies there , as do the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
It is now three years and two months since the restoration of constitutional order enabled the Haitian people bravely to take up again the task of creating a State based on the rule of law and a democratic regime capable of ensuring increasing respect for the political , economic and social rights of all citizens .  
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
Reviewing the past and looking to the future , people throughout the world are anxiously waiting for the establishment of a just and equitable new international political and economic order , and they are hoping to see lasting peace and prosperity for all in the coming century .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
Member States have an ongoing commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law , which are founded on total and mutual respect for the territorial integrity and political systems of other States and non-interference in their internal affairs ; the non-use of force ; and the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiations .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
With sufficient political will and the coordinated implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , as well as international cooperation in creating an enabling environment , full employment remains an attainable goal .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
At the Social Summit , heads of State or Government committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of mankind .  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
The " parliamentary elections " took place as scheduled and were followed by a second round on 7 December , despite numerous calls by the international community for them not to take place until the conclusion of an agreement on the political status of Abkhazia that respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
Whereas building a democratic , multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , with social justice , calls for equitable participation by all citizens , both men and women , on the basis of complete political and ideological pluralism ,  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
Factors contributing to this deficiency include lack of political will , unavailability of sufficient financial means , lack of full understanding of the exact obligations of the instrument , and the compressed time schedule of many negotiations , which may leave room for multiple interpretations of the agreed text , and this may give rise to potential disputes .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .  
If local action is the basis of sustainable development , future decisions on political and economic resource allocation at the national level will need to give priority to supporting local authorities .  
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
In particular , he stressed the need for fundamental political rights and freedoms to be protected during the electoral campaign , if the elections were to be recognized as free and fair .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
This national undertaking calls for an implementation strategy that sets realistic priorities for gradual fulfilment of the various aspects of the Peace Agreements as and when the political , institutional , financial and technical bases for their implementation are established ,  
Since time immemorial , Zairian women have played a vital role in society , a role which has altered as the country has passed through the social , political and economic changes that have marked the successive eras of its history .  
On the political level , active public life was generally closed to them , apart from a few isolated cases of women rulers5 and others who played a part in " town hall " discussions of social issues .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
The Declaration includes a commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
The Special Rapporteur thus deeply regrets the fact that the States which had formed the nucleus of this multinational force were forced to break off their concerted efforts , after spending weeks setting up a base at Entebbe ( Uganda ) , owing to the lack of sufficient political support from the international community and to Rwanda 's repeated opposition to the undertaking .  
The input of the United Nations University ( UNU ) to the preparatory process included international conferences on world cities and urban future , and human settlements in the changing global political and economic processes .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
According to official and non _ government observers , the destruction of Babri Masjid was an incident , an aberration , the result of the political exploitation of religion by ultra _ nationalist political parties , and can not be interpreted as evidence of an official policy of religious intolerance directed against Muslims .  
In actual fact the authorities were combating the development of a militant Sikh terrorist movement campaigning for a separate and autonomous Sikh state , which had first appeared in 1978 ; it was financed by the Sikh diaspora ( and even by Pakistan ) and was using religion to secure the support of Sikhs and as an easy means of whipping up their passions in favour of a purely political cause .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .  
However , the economic and cultural poverty of the most disadvantaged is a fertile breeding _ ground for the development of religious extremism and , more generally , for the political exploitation of religion ; this is evidenced by the conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the destruction of Babri Masjid and the intercommunal riots in Bombay .  
India 's political commitment to unity in diversity , by which it seeks to make viable a democracy covering a subcontinent and embracing a society which is multireligious and multilingual ( and therefore differentiated , diversified and complex ) is certainly an example which the country is offering to humankind and which reflects a mode of democratic organization of society based on respect for and viability of diversity , particularly in the field of religion .  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
He emphasized the fact that , owing to the deleterious effects of transborder crime , international cooperation against it had become the fourth major area after political , economic and military cooperation .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
This Government is necessary not just because it will symbolize the participation of all political parties represented in the Parliament , but because it establishes an important starting point for efforts to strengthen still fragile balances and constitutes a special forum for joint action that can help the taking of decisions devoted to the common management of national affairs .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation ,  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
With sufficient political will and the coordinated implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , as well as international cooperation in creating an enabling environment , full employment remains an attainable goal .  
It becomes more sensitive and complicated when it relates to the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif Jerusalem which has a unique political status and represents the spiritual patrimony of three religions and is closely linked to deep religious feelings in the Islamic world .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of the objectives of the Convention is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
The future is contingent on global economic developments as well as on local and national social , cultural , political and economic initiatives .  
In addition , it exceeded the mandate of a human rights working group by recommending detailed social , political and economic programmes at the national and international levels , and guidelines for international cooperation , some of which were not directly linked to the impact of structural adjustment programmes .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
Constant dialogue among the main social , economic and political actors will be necessary in order to move forward effectively on such basic issues as land , taxation , justice , public security , decentralization , local development and multiculturalism .  
FLNKS believes that the local partners in the Matignon Accords should also be in a position to resume bilateral discussions on the country 's institutional future before the whole range of political groups , social and professional categories , and traditional institutions is associated with the approach advocated by FLNKS .  
It encompassed detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which had been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
However , my Special Representative and all observers concur that , at this time of renewed violence and growing political and social tension , the situation in Haiti is more precarious than it was four months ago , when the authorized strength of the Mission was considered a minimum .  
The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
The serious consequences of the sanctions and the embargo imposed on Iraq have aroused widespread international concern in official , political , legal and civic circles .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Stressing that , in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to eradicating poverty throughout the world through national action and international cooperation , taking account of the fact that this is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
Noting that the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has highlighted the imbalance in the special rapporteur system by referring to the fact that although there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the recognized interdependence , indivisibility and interrelationship of the two sets of rights ,  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
The purpose of turning their bimonthly meetings into a political / technical seminar , with the participation of the Commission 's and Iraq 's scientific and technical experts , has been to narrow the major outstanding issues to a manageable quantity .  
The UNSCOM 168 team undertook preparatory work for the December political level talks which included interviews of personnel involved in the storage , movement and destruction , and in accounting of proscribed missile assets declared to have been secretly destroyed in 1991 .  
In view of the grave consequences of a possible intensification of military confrontation , the Polish delegation shares the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his report that it is necessary to increase and coordinate international efforts to impress upon the Afghan parties the need to solve the conflict in a peaceful way , that is to arrive at a lasting political settlement with the participation of all segments of Afghan society .  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti , as reflected in particular in the holding of five elections that culminated with the presidential elections of 17 December 1995 , which permitted the first transfer of power between two democratically elected Presidents , and takes note of the partial parliamentary elections held on 6 April 1997 ;  
Again urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees , to cease all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres , and to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary police or prison custody where family members and lawyers can visit them , and that such persons receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
While the United Nations has been successful in its humanitarian intervention , it has been less successful with the establishment of local political and social institutions capable of taking over for the State institutions destroyed in the civil war .  
The unbridled power struggle is thus nourished by rivalries among the leaders of various clans and by their unquenchable thirst for political power commensurate with their moral and religious domination of the members of their respective communities .  
If a serious political dialogue is re-established among the main Somali factions , we sincerely hope that a national reconciliation package will include the following measures : respect for human rights , and an end to the appalling situation still prevailing in the country ; the establishment of , and strict adherence to , the rule of law ; the creation of a national army and a national police force ; and the promise of elections , whenever feasible , to ensure the primacy of democracy .  
As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
The Convention envisages that , to be effective , this equality must be achieved within the framework of a political system in which each citizen enjoys the right to vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot , in such a way as to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate , as provided for under international human rights instruments , such as article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Women are rarely appointed to these senior or influential positions and while their numbers may in some States be increasing at the lower levels and in posts usually associated with the home or the family , they form only a tiny minority in decision-making positions concerned with economic policy or development , political affairs , defence , peacemaking missions , conflict resolution or constitutional interpretation and determination .  
Measures that have been adopted by some political parties include setting aside for women a certain minimum number or percentage of positions on their executive bodies , ensuring that there is a balance between the number of male and female candidates nominated for election , and ensuring that women are not consistently assigned to less favourable constituencies or to the least advantageous positions on a party list .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
In its decision 1996 / 117 , the Sub _ Commission decided to request Mr . Osman El _ Hajj to prepare , without financial implications , an expanded working paper on ways and means of promoting democracy , how democracy can ensure economic , social , cultural and political rights and how to overcome obstacles to democracy , and to present the expanded working paper to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
The Slovak party has informed representatives of the Commission of the European Union as well as the States members of the latter on all legislative , legal and internal political aspects relating to the preparation and subsequent conduct of the referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , including the fourth question on direct presidential elections which proved to be invalid from the legislative point of view .  
The Mission continued to stress the need to plan the short , medium and long-term phases of this complex process , bearing in mind the political , technical and social implications of the reform .  
At a moment when the fragility of the ambient political , social and economic context is placing additional pressures and burdens on the recently laid foundations of the key institutions that underpin the rule of law , the continuing presence of MICIVIH remains essential to the consolidation of democracy . 
The section prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex , race , colour , nationality , religion , political opinion , social or family status or other similar circumstances .  Notwithstanding the fact that this principle was , before the Act entered into effect , considered to be one of the unwritten basic principles of administrative law , it was deemed necessary to enact an express provision to this effect .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .  The Sub-Commission should look into the possibility of establishing an international trust fund for the rehabilitation of the survivors of population transfer .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
This is both a theoretical and political challenge as these rights were formulated in a context that was totally different economically and above all politically : the post-war period , the cold war , the existence of a socialist bloc and of competitive capitalism based on strong nation states .  
A strong , almost visionary political will would allow the implementation of article 2 of the Covenant , wherein each State Party undertakes " to take steps , individually and through international assistance and cooperation , especially economic and technical , to the maximum of its available resources , with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant " ( . . . ) .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
We firmly believe that the meeting of the two leaders would signal the start of the necessary process of healing the deep psychological and political trauma left by more than 20 years of bitter internal conflict .  
We sincerely hope that the Angolan Government , and UNITA in particular , will , in the fundamental interests of the people of their country and in a continued spirit of unity and cooperation , seize the historic opportunity to complete as soon as possible the pending tasks in the political and military fields and achieve national reconciliation at an early date , thus paving the way for national reconstruction and development in the country .  
We urge the Government of Angola , and in particular UNITA , to make haste and complete the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process , including the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory in accordance with the agreed timetable and procedures ; the transformation of the UNITA radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility ; the registration and demobilization of all remaining military elements ; the elimination of all obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods ; and the disarmament of the civilian population .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
After extended discussions during which the relevant institutional and political actors sought to identify potential solutions to this problem , the Government decided to promulgate a decree establishing a temporary legal mechanism which would extend special documentation facilitating access to pension benefits .  
Reaffirming that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political progress , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ,  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
Upon the initiative of the respected leader , a proposal was made in August 1981 to hold a Conference for the Promotion of National Reunification , with the participation of the representatives of the political parties and organizations from the north , the south and the overseas compatriots and to convene a joint conference in February 1982 to be attended by 100 persons , including politicians from the north , the south and overseas .  
The implication that incitement to violence and violence itself is a legitimate and understandable response to political differences is irresponsible in the extreme and can only be considered complicity in the repeated deliberate attempts to escalate artificially violence in the territories .  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
Take note of the Preliminary Agreement on a National Reconciliation Pact , which is the outcome of a broad consultation of those representing the vital forces of the Central African nation , thereby embodying the solemn commitment of the political parties , the trade union federations and the civil society to respect the constitutional legal order and to lend full support to all initiatives to promote dialogue and national reconciliation ;  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
We are all aware that the Government and people of Haiti bear the principal responsibility for the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of the country , but we also know that , if long-term peace and stability are to be attained , it is indispensable that the international community make a sustained commitment to cooperation .  That is why we are present here today .  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
The main lesson that we should draw from the limited success of past efforts in this regard is that the legal , political and practical complexity of the issues involved makes it impossible to apply ready-made , generalized solutions .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
Difficult and painful reform lies ahead if Albania is to succeed in fostering political and social reconciliation , economic development , consolidation of a fully functioning and independent judiciary and electronic media , and the creation of active civil-society institutions .  
We believe that the Albanian operation has set a significant precedent for potential future interventions by the international community in cases where a State is gripped by a complex crisis with serious humanitarian implications and political repercussions for its neighbours .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through the debate on the report , the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as to set priorities in the context of the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
The General Assembly acknowledged that " to maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide " ( A / S-19 / 29 , annex , para .  39 ) .  
Urges Governments and non _ governmental , national and international organizations to collect and disseminate gender _ disaggregated statistics and indicators to monitor the representation and participation of women at all levels of political , economic and social life , with special attention to the impact of the multiple barriers faced by many women who exist at the intersection of discrimination , based on race , gender and poverty ;  
As a result , the aim of the Funds political empowerment programme is to address the obstacles and challenges that prevent women from contributing their vision to a new world of equality , development and peace and from participating in its construction under the framework of universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated human rights .  
If in the near future an assessment , even preliminary , of the danger level for the climate system was successfully concluded , it would be easier to adopt a political decision regarding quantitative targets on reduction and elimination of greenhouse gases and to consider the outline of a protocol or other legal document containing the obligations of the parties to the Convention beyond the year 2000 .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
It is incumbent upon that organization to show to the international community , through practical , credible and trustworthy deeds , that it has indeed demilitarized , that it no longer claims and controls any portion of the country 's territory , that its radio broadcasting system is complying with Angola 's laws , and that it has truly become a genuine political party . 
Whereas the date of 27 July 1997 had been accepted by the Congolese political community as a whole , represented within the National Commission responsible for the special administrative census , and by the prospective candidates in the presidential elections , in a solemn commitment signed on 31 May 1997 under the auspices of the Director-General of UNESCO , Mr . Federico Mayor ,  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
Honduras pressed ahead with the cleansing of its political system , and Panama continued the process of broadening national consensus around the goal of a successful management of the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
Reiterating that many citizens who took part in the armed rebellion against the Republic of Croatia have sought and been granted Croatian documents , and that they have by this act accepted all the rights and obligations that derive from Croatian citizenship , including respect for and defence of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia , and that they have accepted the Republic of Croatia as their homeland and have expressed the wish to be included in its political , economic and social life , and in that way to contribute to its prosperity ,  
The Programme shall be implemented in particular but not exclusively , in the following fields : political , legal , administrative , internal affairs , economic , social , cultural , educational , reconstruction and return and the media .  
In the light of the foregoing considerations and taking into account the dynamics and political importance of the subject , we have decided to instruct our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to maintain a broad dialogue on the issue , taking into account the regional interest , and to seek an understanding on the subject .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
With the advent of the twenty-first century , we now face an historic choice as to what kind of a world we should bring to the new century .  The Chinese delegation holds that the international community should work to establish a just and rational new international political and economic order to ensure global and regional security .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
Singapore believed , however , that the guiding principles which would allow for the application of international law without the exercise of political influence and afford States , large and small alike , a level playing field , should include those principles that prohibited discrimination , coercion and reneging on previous agreements as well as those that encouraged the open and candid exchange of information and discouraged misinformation and the introduction of irrelevant considerations .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility for securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .  
Change was the sole constant epitomizing the reality of today , and extraordinarily rapid and dramatic internationalization was bringing profound social , political and economic change .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
In the context of widespread rumours about arrests , executions and disappearances , and of the evacuation of their nationals by several embassies , numerous persons affiliated with FUNCINPEC , BLDP and KNP , including senior political , military and police officials of those parties , parliamentarians , leading activists and supporters , as well as affiliated journalists , reported threats and intimidations and expressed fears for their lives and safety .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
The autocrat was barred by ill health from governing , the Kengo Government had fallen into disrepute , the people were bewildered and disillusioned and the political class was discredited . 13 The Catholic bishops stated on 4 January that , in order to hold on to power , members of the transitional institutions were resorting to demagogic manoeuvres , such as lies , deception and corruption , and refusing to bow to popular sovereignty . 
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
The study might also include ( a ) knowledge about human rights among the general population , as well as potential target groups ; ( b ) social , political and economic conditions relevant to human rights education ; ( c ) human rights educational access for marginalized groups ; and ( d ) treatment of human rights issues by the mass media ( including television , radio , newspapers and popular magazines ) .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the draft Mining Code provides that activities in the Area " shall be carried out under such conditions that the workers employed in such activities are afforded adequate protection against discrimination in employment on the grounds of race , colour , sex , religion , political opinion , national extraction or social origin , as well as in the fields of occupational safety and health , labour relations , including freedom of association , conditions of work , social security , employment security and living conditions at the worksite " . 
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
Referring to the meagre share of LDCs in world trade , the dwindling ODA flows and the staggering debt burden , he called for a renewed and broad-based political consensus on the part of the international community to reverse the growing marginalization of these countries .  
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
In its resolution 51 / 30 G of 13 December 1996 , on assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia , the General Assembly noted with concern that political instability and the absence of central authority continued to characterize Somalia and that , while the environment had become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , in others the humanitarian and security situation had worsened .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The court should be impartial and independent , complementary to national criminal justice systems but not subordinate to them or to any national or international political body .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
But it goes beyond a mere series of defined activities , combining political , economic , legal , social and environmental measures within a common framework .  
Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields , and expresses the hope that he will continue to strengthen the mechanisms of coordination between the two organizations ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee equally will need to play a more active role in several respects : assessing the degree to which the needs of the internally displaced are being met by the United Nations system generally as well as in specific situations , calling upon other United Nations agencies to play strong supporting roles in the humanitarian effort , pressing for political action to resolve the crises that create humanitarian emergencies and drawing attention to situations that receive insufficient attention .  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In order to take effective legislative and political measures to ensure equality between women and men , Bulgaria had adopted a national plan of action in 1996 aimed at protecting the human rights of women , improving their economic and social status , eradicating female poverty , promoting the participation of women in decision-making , improving the health of women and eliminating all forms of violence against women . 
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
The strategic framework for Afghanistan proposes a more holistic approach by the international community , whereby the political efforts of the United Nations inform , and are informed by , the international community 's social , economic and humanitarian priorities .  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
It has also had a deleterious impact on the body politic , weakening further the authority of the State , eroding the little confidence enjoyed by the executive and the legislative branches and increasing public disillusion and cynicism vis - - vis politicians and political parties .  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Again urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees , to cease all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres , and to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary police or prison custody where family members and lawyers can visit them , and that such persons receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards ;  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
It should be borne in mind that the expanded verification role of MINUGUA covers a package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and URNG , which include detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which are bound together into a national peace agenda . 
A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
The financial situation of the Agency was becoming more disturbing with every year that passed , and in that connection the European Union called on the international community to provide maximum political and financial support to the Agency and to give it sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its tasks until a just , lasting and comprehensive solution had been found to the political problems which had led to the appearance of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East . 
The regulation on certain issues of State information policy of January 1996 , mentioned above , in addition to specifications regarding registration , placed the regional and district press under the direct control of the local political administration , with local executive committees being empowered to approve editors-in _ chief who themselves become members of the committees .  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .  
Given that terrorism posed a stumbling block to worldwide social , economic and political development and was , moreover , a violation of human rights , concerted international efforts should be made to eliminate it .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through its debate the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as for priority setting by Member States in the context of major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
At a time when the precarious nature of the political , social and economic climate is exerting increasing pressure on the foundations of the key institutions on which respect for the rule of law depend , it is more necessary than ever that the international community continue and step up its assistance , and contribute , by its presence , to consolidating democratic institutions in Haiti . 
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
It is symbolic that a representative of a renewed democracy which is living through a period of fundamental social , economic and political reforms , has become President of the General Assembly at a time when the issue of United Nations reform tops its agenda .  
During the next 12 months , we have to cope with a vast agenda covering a broad range of political , economic , social , disarmament and humanitarian issues , as well as legal , administrative and budgetary ones .  
Respect for human rights is achieved not only through the functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with international treaties but also through political , social and economic measures that allow human rights to become an integral part of social development and a part of the everyday life of each individual .  
Despite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of members of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past few years to contain the devastating effects of the conflicts in the Arab Gulf region , which has great importance to regional and international strategies , and their continuing endeavour to support progress towards joint reconstruction and cooperation , the unstable political and security conditions in the region remain a source of concern for us .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
In this respect , the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international drug control , which is to be held in June 1998 , will provide us with an excellent opportunity to renew our political commitment by closing our ranks against illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for progress in preventive efforts .  
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
By engendering social and racial harmony based on a political compact , we have been spared many of the traumas experienced by less fortunate countries and we were thus able to achieve our development goals in relative peace and tranquillity .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .  
The tragic events in former Yugoslavia , the crises and convulsions on the territory of the former Soviet Union and elsewhere , the emergence of aggressive nationalism as well as populism in Central and Eastern Europe , as an appealing remedy for political problems , economic difficulties and social tensions , are vivid reminders of the critical , sometimes lethal , nature of these challenges .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
More attention should be given to appropriate and timely preventive measures , because we believe that early measures adopted by the international community are the ideal way to avert the outbreak of conflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessary political and military measures in the aftermath of the conflict let alone imposing half solutions that are often unfair .  
Here again it must be recalled that the combined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU and the lucid and commendable actions of President El Hadj Omar Bongo , President of the Gabonese Republic and also of the international mediation committee , have , unfortunately , not managed to find a political way out of this grave internal crisis , the prolongation of which is a serious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
In this way , we can avoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are irrelevant to such interests , but affect narrow regional calculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues of international peace and security .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
Yet while today it is the Congolese people who are hostages , perhaps tomorrow it will be another people 's turn to be taken hostage by a political class that is driven by selfish ambitions , unprepared to accept the rules of democracy and uninterested in seeking and maintaining peace .  Every day and at an increasing human cost , the excessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of others defer to a later date the establishment of conditions for a negotiated peace .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
This will enable the Organization to meet the daunting challenges of economic development faced by our global community and those posed by the political and ideological differences afflicting nations today .  
It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
Convinced of the need effectively to tackle the problems confronting them in this area , they have committed themselves to creating an economic , social , political , cultural and ecological environment that is conducive to social development , as well as to giving priority to national and international policies and initiatives aimed at eliminating poverty , promoting employment , combating unemployment and fostering social integration .  
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
While it is true that responsibility for social development lies , first and foremost , with States themselves , which have the right and duty to implement appropriate policies to achieve that objective , it is no less true that this responsibility must be assumed , in a spirit of solidarity , by the international community as a whole , not just because of moral and political requirements that are broadly shared today , but also because of the enlightened self-interest of us all .  
The Summit \ x { e5b8 } future-oriented outlook , as reflected in the Declaration \ x { e5b8 } principles and goals , was a commitment to a political , economic , ethical and spiritual vision for social development , which , in addition to the principles I have just referred to , called for full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of people .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
The Nicaragua Declaration , signed one and a half months ago , strengthened the process of regional integration and laid the foundation for a possible political unification of the Central American countries , and it further enhanced Central American social , economic and trade policy .  
All national development efforts need a vision a focal point to make coordinated and sustained improvements supported by political will , the participation of the people and solid organizational and financial backing .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
The World Summit for Social Development organized two years ago in a post-cold-war international environment characterized by profound social , economic and political changes and increasing globalization represented a milestone in the history of international cooperation .  
The purpose was to begin to create a new human being with stronger moral values and principles , a human being who is more tolerant of differences , more productive economically , with ideals , loyalty and virtue in political matters and embracing social unity ; in sum , to try to alter elements that are deeply rooted in a population , as well as those that are emerging .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
Also , as the Secretary-General has noted elsewhere , the transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting the fulfilment of even national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
During the Security Council debate of 14 August 1997 on the conclusion of Operation Alba , many delegations described it as a model , including the following aspects : unity of intent by the group of countries involved ; decisive , prompt action taken by the Security Council ; a very clear mandate ; definite limits on the time-frame ; rapid planning and deployment ; and in-depth political coordination and consultation among all the parties involved , with none excluded , through an ad hoc steering committee .  
The resolution calls for a report that is more easily directed to assessing the way in which mandates of the General Assembly have been fulfilled over the past year and setting priorities for the period ahead in the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial areas .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
This problem is of particular significance to Korea , as numerous Korean cultural objects have been pillaged and illegally transferred abroad during our country \ x { e5b8 } history of political turmoil , especially in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century .  
Sound political logic and balanced reasoning are required from all of us , primarily with regard to the pivotal equation , that is , finding the golden mean between the level of representation on the reformed Security Council and the imperative need to ensure its effectiveness .  
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
The operative part recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as a mechanism for coordinating and harmonizing regional efforts to achieve economic , social , cultural , environmental and political integration .  
However , the Dominican Republic is aware that the stability and creditability of a democratic system does not depend on willingness alone , but on a wide range of political , economic , social , cultural and environmental factors .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 51 / 146 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and to promoting the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
Crises require a coherent and effective international response , a response that should integrate preventive diplomacy , political mediation and humanitarian relief , but also social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication . 
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
This peace was pursued on the basis of the mutual recognition of the legitimate rights of both peoples and their desire to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and a historic reconciliation through the agreed political process .  
The mutual recognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 , the signing of the Declaration of Principles and the subsequent withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and some areas of the West Bank , as well as the establishment of an elected Palestinian Authority , were historic milestones along the road to peace that the international community encouraged and nurtured with political and financial support .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
This session is confronted with the onerous task not only of pointing to the imbalances that have emerged since Rio between the advances in political and economic reforms achieved in the third world and the clearly diminishing resources to fund sustainable development , but also of securing a renewed commitment , with firm assurances , to stronger financial aid .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
The political process of establishing and maintaining sound long-term development policies tends to be most successful when the Government has a strong legislative position , visionary leadership , and a united economic policy team .  
In the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , 5 it is acknowledged that the family plays a key role in social development and , as such , should be strengthened , with attention to the rights , capabilities and responsibilities of its members .  Both call for creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
But equality of rights is not yet reflected in everyday life , owing to the slow pace of sociological and political change , resistance from the controllers of capital , clashing economic interests and the resultant widespread violence .  
Furthermore , it was noted that unbalanced international political relations were often an important factor in the occurrence of mass exoduses through the threat to use force or interference in a country 's internal affairs , as was happening in the case of Iraq , where direct or indirect interference by the United States of America and some of its allies was creating tension , encouraging some of the population to leave , particularly for neighbouring countries .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
This youth policy is coordinated on an inter-ministerial basis and involves two major non-governmental organizations : the National Union of Syrian Students ( with a membership composed of students in universities , postgraduate studies and higher and intermediate institutes ) and the Revolutionary Youth Union ( with a membership of over 1.5-million composed of young workers , rural youth , students with both political and non-political backgrounds , including social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic and artistic . 
In section II of the Manila Declaration adopted by that meeting ( see A / 51 / 293 , annex ) , youth were affirmed the right to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , educational , cultural , spiritual and moral life as partners in the development of society .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
Several key areas of concern were identified , including clarity of procedures , dual criminality , especially in relation to complex crimes , the political offence exception in a modern context , problems relating to the rule of speciality , conflicting claims of jurisdiction , non-extradition of nationals and differences in evidentiary standards and burdens .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
Optimism , combined with an awareness of the enormous task ahead , will be necessary in creating an environment in which the people of Guatemala are able , among other things , to exercise their legitimate civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Her Government 's approach to advancing gender equality was based on the recognition that gender was a factor in the nation 's current social , economic , cultural and political systems and that the unequal status of women had its genesis in and was perpetuated by systemic causes . 
He has expressed regret that agreements reached without the participation of the people might postpone the transition to 1997 ; he has pointed out that confidence in the political classes has been lost because of their failure to implement the directives of CNS and that , during the first 8 months _ out of a total of 24 _ of the extended period , only one of the prior requirements for elections has been satisfied , namely , approval of the Law on the establishment of CNE in an atmosphere of complete national indifference . 
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
It identified three key conditions for success : a fair and credible political framework ; an efficient and well-planned electoral operation ; and adequate support from the international community .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
The Independent Expert observed the progress made with regard to civil and political rights , identified weaknesses in the justice system and public security and drew attention to the need to find lasting solutions to problems affecting economic and social rights .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
The European Union is aware of the challenge ahead for Nicaragua 's new administration , which faces an extensive programme of social and economic reforms , already embarked on by the Government of Mrs . Chamorro , that is only achievable with the consensus of the political groups and with parliamentary agreement between the party in Government and the opposition .  
All Sudanese citizens living in areas controlled by the Government of the Sudan are potential victims of human rights violations and abuses , regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic origin or social status , once they are considered to be opponents of the Government of the Sudan , or even suspected of being in disagreement with its political agenda .  
According to reports received in January 1997 , besides the practice of summoning suspected political opponents to the security headquarters every day early in the morning and releasing them late in the evening , night _ time summoning to the security headquarters became a constant feature in Khartoum and other major northern Sudanese towns during the second half of 1996 .  33 .  On 15 August 1996 , 65 civilians and active and retired officers were arrested in Port Sudan .  
On 21 September 1996 , the Vice-President of SLORC , Gen .

In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .  
More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Attention was drawn to the frequent emphasis placed by international forums on the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
The effort has attracted strong and high _ level political support from a large number of countries ; it is overwhelmingly supported by the public , leading NGOs and a growing band of senior military figures .  
Housing , being the most important single investment in the life of the majority of the world 's population , should not be considered only in its aspect of physical shelter , but should be given full consideration as the most important element of family life where all social , economic , cultural and political activities begin and are sustained .  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
Those documents contain many factual clarifications and rebuttals of the allegations and fabrications , totally unsubstantiated by any material proof , which the Special Rapporteur included in his previous reports and which he is still reiterating for political reasons the main aim of which is to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national leadership .  
The Government of Iraq resorted to the imposition of a tax on travel as a purely administrative and financial measure that was not intended to impede travel by citizens or discriminate between them on political or social grounds ; it was necessitated by the situation brought about by the iniquitous economic embargo imposed on Iraq .  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The experience of countries which have chosen the challenging road to sustainable development , democracy and human rights , and which are already beginning to enjoy the fruits of this decision in the form of interrelated economic progress , political consolidation and social stability , proves that human rights are not only noble ideas .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work closely with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the peoples of Afghanistan ;  
The representative of Ireland , speaking on behalf of the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Stressing that all members of the international community shall fulfil , jointly and separately , their solemn obligation to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind including distinctions based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ,  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political as well as other fields and the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all these rights and freedoms in practice .  
The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Stressing that all members of the international community shall fulfil , jointly and separately , their solemn obligation to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status , and stressing the paramount importance of achieving international cooperation to fulfil this obligation , according to the United Nations Charter ,  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .  
Emphasizing the priority that attaches to implementing specific measures to establish mechanisms that will facilitate the attainment of the practical objectives of building a democratic State ruled by law , based on political pluralism , the market economy , supremacy of the law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
The integration of Azerbaijan and Georgia , which are an integral part of Europe , into the European institutions will create broad opportunities for resolving political , economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems on the basis of universally accepted European standards ;  
The measures to prevent and control the phenomenon , which need to be elaborated and implemented at the national and international levels , cut across the economic , social , cultural , political and legal fields .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti , as reflected in particular in the holding of five elections that culminated with the presidential elections of 17 December 1995 , which permitted the first transfer of power between two democratically elected Presidents as well as , more recently , the partial parliamentary elections held on 6 April 1997 ;  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Again urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees , to cease all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres , and to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary police or prison custody where family members and lawyers can visit them , and that such persons receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards ;  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
While the United Nations has long experience in implementing humanitarian programmes during periods of peace , conflict and post-conflict situations , it should be emphasized that the humanitarian programme pursuant to resolution 986 ( 1995 ) is unique and is being implemented within the context of a sanctions regime with all its attendant political and commercial dimensions .  
In view of Egypt 's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation , we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti , and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors , namely , elections , economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister .  
And yet , in the light of the precarious security situation and the lack of a functioning judicial system , compounded by the climate of political instability , more should be done if the international community \ x { e5b8 } hard-won achievements are to be made irreversible .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
Jordan also supported resolution 51 / 210 , in which the General Assembly had renewed its affirmation that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstance unjustifiable .  
The technological advances that were often readily available to potential terrorists called for a higher degree of political cooperation , and new challenges would undoubtedly emerge that would require innovative legal approaches and techniques to meet them , and joint efforts with other international and regional bodies . 
A list of the 27 agreements of continuing validity , current as at 27 November , appears in annex I . Taken together with the provisions of the Croatian Constitution , those agreements , for which the Government of Croatia has made itself internationally accountable , provide a comprehensive political and institutional framework of guarantees , which , if fully implemented , will allow the people of the region to exercise freely their rights and obligations as equal citizens of Croatia . 
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Terrorism had been clearly and definitively rejected by the international community because it violated the most basic of human rights , the right to life ; because it mutilated , tortured and violated human minds and bodies ; and because , with its underlying morbid and fascist philosophy , it aimed to paralyse social , political and cultural life and to obstruct the normal exercise of rights and freedoms .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
He reaffirmed his Governments view that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ; it opposed the specific reference to Jerusalem which had no effect on issues of sovereignty and prejudged the final political arrangements in territories that could be determined only by the direct negotiations to which the parties had committed themselves .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and strongly urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi _ party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative Government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
As a single united Government of Angola takes up the daunting task of providing all Angolans with the political stability and economic development which they have so long awaited , it is our sincerest hope that a successful transition to democratic pluralism will replace , once and for all , the violence and mistrust which have historically marked relations between the Government and UNITA .  
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
Its portrayal of these problems , however , as being such that they can not be solved through a technical process only and as requiring a major political solution is incorrect and contradicts the conclusion drawn in paragraph 46 that not much is unknown about Iraq 's proscribed capabilities .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the medicines they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq .  
These facts have not been enough to persuade the representative of the United States of America to desist from using irresponsible methods to prevent thousands of sick children , older persons and women from obtaining the drugs they need to alleviate the suffering brought on by the diseases they have contracted as a result of the maintenance of the unjust embargo against Iraq , which has taken on a political and biased character and which has the goal of undermining the national political regime in Iraq . 
While the situation within that country has stabilized to some degree , owing to the deployment of the multinational protection force and to the efforts of various humanitarian agencies , it is anticipated that the restoration of political , economic and social order will take some time , even after the election that is planned for late June .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
The United Nations Security Coordinator formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Organization on current and potential security-related problems and is responsible for coordinating , planning and implementing inter-agency security and safety programmes and for acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation . 
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
While recognizing the ongoing informal consultations between some administering Powers and the Special Committee , those administering Powers should re-establish their formal cooperation with the Special Committee , facilitate the United Nations visiting missions to the Territories under their administration to provide adequate up-to-date information on political , economic and social developments in their respective Territories with particular emphasis on their constitutional , political and socio-economic evolution towards exercise of the right to self-determination ;  
While there is no commonly accepted definition of what good governance , or " capable " government , means in operational terms , at the very least it signifies the existence of a stable and relatively open and transparent political framework that is representative of , and responsive to , the will of the people .  
An enabling environment , understood in its broadest sense , encompasses the whole panoply of national and international policies , measures and institutions in the economic , social , legal and political domains that influence or affect the growth and development prospects of a country .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
In light of the Committees view that further efforts are required to ensure that the Convention is used as a political tool and a framework for action on behalf of children , the Committee recommends that future national and local programmes of action on children incorporate policies , programmes , aims and goals reflecting the principles and provisions of the Convention .  
A solid legal and contractual basis is being established for Russian-Ukrainian interaction in the political , economic , scientific and technological and humanitarian fields .  
The Presidents reached agreement on the main tasks for further developing and deepening Russian-Ukrainian ties , and stated that the paramount task was to ensure the practical implementation of the provisions of the new general political Treaty signed during the visit .  
I should like to call your attention to the fact that , during the initial 180-day period the Memorandum of Understanding has been in effect , the representative of the United States of America in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) has deliberately obstructed and delayed the processing of contracts in the Committee for odious political reasons inimical to the people of Iraq .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation as an ethical social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
In fact , it should be evident that in our forum , political realism and a diplomatic approach constitute the fundamental essence of any aim and , consequently it would be advisable , albeit without denying the full respect of each national position , that adequate room be left for a free comparison of different theses in order to find a minimum common denominator on which the best solution for the successful attainment of our endeavours can be arrived at . 
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
The representative made clear that Venezuela , as well as the rest of Latin America , was experiencing social , political , economic and cultural transformations that were having a tremendous impact on society , particularly on women , who had seen their incomes and traditional sources of support reduced and their responsibilities expanded .  
Shall we simply say that we engaged in endless debate , encompassing plenary meetings , informal plenary meetings , open _ ended consultations , and meetings of regional and political groups and other impromptu gatherings too numerous to mention ? 
On the subject of refugee status being granted to women fleeing female genital mutilation as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in her final report , note should be taken with satisfaction of the initiative taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in September 1996 when it assembled the representatives of 16 Western countries in Geneva to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for awarding refugee status to the problems specific to women and which differ from the generally recognized forms of political persecution .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights . 
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has also stated that equal attention and urgent consideration should be devoted to the realization , promotion and protection of both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
In its resolution 4 ( XXXIII ) of 21 February 1977 , the Commission on Human Rights stresses the responsibility and duty of all members of the international community to create the necessary conditions for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights as an essential means of ensuring the real and meaningful enjoyment of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
The scope of this report is too narrow for a detailed description of the numerous serious violations of rights of all kinds , whether civil and political or economic , social or cultural , considered either collectively or individually .  
It was erected into a system of government and applied for about a century accompanied by violations of human rights , both economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
These causes should be addressed in a coherent , well-planned , coordinated and comprehensive manner with political , social , economic and developmental instruments .  
The report says that a change of this magnitude requires a package of measures that combine : ( a ) the strengthening of tax administration ; ( b ) the expansion of the tax base and the revision of the principal taxes ; and ( c ) the creation of a team that is committed to reform , supported at the highest political level and backed by a solid social consensus .  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
Also deeply concerned about the rising illicit cultivation of narcotic crops and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs , which pose the main threat to the political , economic , social and cultural structure and stability of the region ,  
However , in complex or overtly political situations , such as Cambodia , southern Sudan , northern Iraq and the former Yugoslavia , special arrangements were put in place on a case _ by _ case basis , including the designation of a lead agency to coordinate the international humanitarian response .  
Injustice , political oppression , human rights abuses , social and economic inequalities , and the absence of democratic freedom and development opportunities are often part of a complex mix of underlying factors contributing to conflict . 
The phenomenon of protracted and growing displacement , warfare that targets civilians and demolishes communities , and the disintegration of political , institutional and economic structures in crisis countries all point to the need for a better understanding of crises and their adverse impact on vulnerable communities .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
The Ministers acknowledged the actions undertaken by the organs of the Community to implement the decisions and recommendations that had emanated from the Conference of Heads of State and Government and from the Council of Ministers , in conformity with the general guidelines contained in the Constitutive Declaration and the Statutes , in order to promote cooperation in the cultural , economic , social , scientific and legal / institutional fields , as well as to enhance political and diplomatic coordination .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The process of achieving peace requires the building of confidence , political reconciliation based on peace agreements among all States of the region , peaceful relations among all peoples in the region , economic cooperation , as well as eventual arms control and disarmament regimes where priority is assigned to systems that experience has proven to be destructive and destabilizing .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Urges Governments and non _ governmental , national and international organizations to collect and disseminate gender _ disaggregated statistics and indicators to monitor the representation and participation of women at all levels of political , economic and social life , with special attention to the impact of the multiple barriers faced by many women who exist at the intersection of discrimination , based on race , gender and poverty ;  
Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
The borderlines between political and criminal violence become blurred as precious time is lost in waiting for the overall settlement of long-standing issues which become more entangled as the search continues for a lasting resolution of problems firmly entrenched in history .  
Included in this latter group are the United Nations political and economic and social departments ( Department of Political Affairs , Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department for Economic and Social Affairs ) and the World Health Organization . The political departments of the United Nations Secretariat consider the Agency 's support for the rule of law , promotion of human rights , democratization , human capacity-building and electoral assistance as strong potential areas , particularly in respect of cooperation for peacekeeping and peace-building programmes . 
Among the recommendations made in the report were an emphasis on the importance of increasing economic growth rates in order to increase the rate of employment growth , and a recognition that this would require political and social as well as macroeconomic stability ; the importance of moderating the excesses of structural adjustment strategies ; an acknowledgement that for certain countries , a more gradual and selective approach to trade liberalization may be warranted ( ibid . , para . 25 ) ; and the value of policy incentives to offset market failure .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
The Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report makes it clear that the peace process has taken a crucial turn and that the progress made during the past two and a half years is threatened by UNITA \ x { e5b8 } delay in implementing its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol : complete military demobilization , facilitation of the Angolan Government \ x { e5b8 } restoration of State administration throughout Angolan territory , the transformation of radio VORGAN into a non-partisan radio station and UNITA \ x { e5b8 } genuine transformation into a political party .  
In Liechtenstein , non-governmental organizations would continue to play a critical role in that process , which would focus , in particular , on motivating women to participate in national political life ; providing academic and vocational guidance for adolescent girls ; facilitating the compatibility of women 's professional and family life , and building public awareness about the problem of violence against women and children .  
The expert groups established by the committee had drawn up a national strategy and a triennial plan of action with the objective of guaranteeing the equality of women before the law , the participation of women in all political institutions , an increase in the participation of women in economic activities , the advancement of rural women and support for women in the territories occupied by Israel .  
A complex process was transforming the world economy and international relations , even though it was impossible to formulate a complete and unified theory of the process and its impact on the economic , social and even political behaviour patterns that had served as the basis of the international order in recent decades .  
The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
On the contrary , the international community should provide a coherent and effective response , incorporating preventive diplomacy , political mediation , humanitarian relief , social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .  
The lessons learned earlier in Rwanda and Somalia , and in Afghanistan during 1996 , showed that as long as political mediation , military and security operations , emergency relief and development assistance operated largely as independent policy instruments , the international response to large-scale violence would be incoherent and ineffective .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .  
He urged the international community to adopt specific measures to stabilize the international economic environment , thereby supporting the developing countries in their efforts to mitigate the political and social costs of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms , rather than simply limiting themselves to the re-establishment of their credit ratings and the liberalization of their markets at all costs .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
Despite the political and economic development achieved at the regional and international levels , the establishment of economic groupings and the expansion of free trade , there had been an increase in poverty , diseases and illiteracy resulting in a deterioration in the standards of living of developing countries .  Moreover , economic barriers continued to be erected against developing countries .  
While the economic reform and political stability programmes had re-established confidence in the country , Cambodia still needed a considerable volume of external assistance especially in the areas of budget support , administrative reform , mine clearance , resettlement and reintegration , agriculture , social services , the maintenance of public utility services and the rehabilitation of transport systems and infrastructure .  
Despite its political will to carry out the necessary reforms , the Cambodian Government continued to face two major obstacles : the enormous bilateral and multilateral debt , which constituted a heavy burden on the Government , and poorer access to markets and deteriorating terms of trade .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
The Government of Mexico , in full respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of self-determination of peoples , and the norms and principles which govern peaceful and friendly relations and cooperation among nations , believes that it is for the people of Cuba alone , in exercise of their inalienable rights , to continue to determine their own political , economic and social organization in a free , sovereign and independent manner .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 51 / 22 , entitled Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , is a timely initiative which aims to address thoroughly the issues of unilateral and extraterritorial measures in a comprehensive and objective fashion .  
The Platform for Action adopted at the Conference was established as a powerful tool for the empowerment of women , aimed at removing all the obstacles to womens active participation in public and private life by promoting their full and equal participation in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making processes .  
In view of the continued conflict and human tragedy in Afghanistan and the stalemated efforts to involve all the parties concerned in constructive and viable political dialogue , on 29 July , I appointed Mr . Lakhdar Brahimi as my Special Envoy on a short mission to consult interested and relevant countries and parties , as well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference , and to present a comprehensive review of the United Nations peacemaking activities in Afghanistan . 
The civil society , including those involved in its political , economic , social and cultural life , needs to be fully engaged to promote democratic principles and harmony between the society , the individual and the environment as a basis for a culture of peace .  
These are , in particular : political leaders , members of Government and of parliament and of other elected bodies ; teaching staff at every level of educational systems and those engaged in non-formal education of children and adults ; journalists ; members of the intellectual community as a whole ; religious leaders ; those having managerial functions at various levels ; non-governmental organizations , especially of women and youth .  
For the purposes of realizing the will of the people and their right to self-determination , creating a responsible Government , preventing a monopoly of power and administrative corruption , electing representatives to the electoral bodies , ensuring free and fair periodical election of the leadership ; the principles of democracy and pluralism shall constitute the mainspring of the future political system to be formed in Afghanistan .  
The model is a good example of successful institutional public / private-sector cooperation involving political , social and economic actors for creating an environment conducive to enterprise development .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
The treatment of the interrelated subjects of trade , finance , technology and investment , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies and their social impact in the international context , should be substantive issues in the political debate conducted in the Committee , since the General Assembly was not only the supreme political body at the intergovernmental level but , above all , the most democratic body in existence .  
It must be recognized that at a time when economies and societies were becoming increasingly interdependent , as stated by the Secretary-General in the 1997 report on the world social situation , transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting fulfilment of even the national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives ( E / 1997 / 15 , p .  2 ) .  
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation had held its first ministerial meeting in Mauritius in March 1997 and adopted its charter , the basic principles of which were respect for sovereign equality , territorial integrity and political independence , non-interference in internal affairs , peaceful coexistence and mutual advantage .  
This was an important meeting devoted to follow-up of the Fourth World Conference on Women and was an unprecedented event at the international level since it brought together an equal number of men and women members of parliament from some 80 countries and provided the occasion for innovative debates on ways of ensuring the joint exercise of political responsibilities .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
The Government of Belarus has never employed economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion and does not recognize the validity of any coercive measures or legislative acts of an extraterritorial nature that are imposed by any State on a unilateral basis .  
The Government of Cuba stated that unilateral coercive measures were punitive actions used by certain States , by virtue of their predominant position in the world economy , to impose their political will by force and to subvert the political , economic and social system of other States . 
Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .  
Those principles and norms , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , elaborated in a number of international legal instruments and backed by declarations adopted by international conferences , proscribe the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State and the imposition of coercive economic measures as instruments of intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State , without prejudice , however , to the application of preventive or enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
The expert group agreed that the problems raised by the imposition of coercive economic measures , including their economic , social , political and legal aspects , deserve increased attention by the international community and multilateral bodies .  
It recommended that analytical and conceptual work be carried out both at the specialized level ( e.g . , through continued efforts for developing methodologies and criteria for impact assessment ) and on an interdisciplinary scale ( i.e . , interrelationship between the political , legal , economic and social dimensions of the problem ) .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
In subsequent statements , particularly , those entitled " political development policies " of the executive branches , emphasis was again placed on respecting human dignity and integrity ; ensuring civil rights and freedom ; defending public trials and the right to a lawyer ; fostering an independent mass media ; and fostering the principles of pluralism and diversity .  
Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable , pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute to peace and development as well as to the establishment of a fair and equitable new international political and economic order .  
The principle of the indivisibility of universally recognized civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights continues to be a key element of today 's system for the promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms .  
Although these States are responsible for their future , the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africa demand a multilateral response to the political , economic and social ills of the region , and the need to address development issues is paramount .  
All human rights political , civil , social and economic are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
These unresolved conflicts undermine the political , economic and social fabric of the States concerned , bringing destruction and untold human suffering to the victims of war .  
On the eve of the new millennium , I am still quite dissatisfied with the level of attention the world community is paying to the severe economic , environmental and potential political problems that threaten small island developing States .  
The United Nations must view all human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural as universal , indivisible , interdependent , interrelated and embedded in the trinity of democracy , development and human rights .  
Unfortunately , an international consensus capable of marshalling the required political and economic resources into a coherent programme for economic development and improved governance at the global level has yet to emerge .  
At both the national and international levels , institutions to promote and protect human rights economic and social , as well as civil and political have spread , and often have flourished .

Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
As a direct result of decolonization , the gap left by the non-indigenous colonial political powers in those continents has been filled by population sectors whose indigenous ( or autochthonous ) condition is indisputable by any of todays standards .  
These effects also included the extinction ( or substantial reduction ) of their territorial base and undermined their political , economic , juridical , cultural and social order in general , and even their survival as a distinct society .  
It is not the task of the Special Rapporteur in this final report to describe in detail the harsh impact on indigenous peoples of being subjected to a new and totally alien social , economic , and political _ juridical order .  
Grosso modo , the newcomers and their successors imbued ( and imbue ) the land with an essentially patrimonial value , making it subject to exclusive individual appropriation ( and , thus , capable of being passed on to others at the will of the title holder ) , a source of material wealth and a basis for political and economic power .  
The process that took the indigenous peoples lands from them left behind very limited and debilitating alternatives for survival : vassalage ( or servitude in its diverse forms ) , segregation in reduced areas reserved for them , or assimilation into the non-indigenous sector of the new socio _ political entity created without indigenous input .  
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
It is the obligation of the entire international presence in Kosovo and Metohija to strictly respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija , which implies respect for its political , administrative , legal , economic and monetary system and an unhindered functioning of public services in accordance with all Yugoslav laws and regulations ;  
The observer for Romania added that the problem of effective participation of political organizations of national minorities , and the recognition of minoritiy representatives in public affairs , should be included in the final document as an element of international preventive policy .  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Guaranteeing our progress and security as well as that of our children within a status of full political dignity , based on the permanent union between Puerto Rico and the United States , embodied in a bilateral pact that can not be altered except by mutual agreement .  
They constituted steps in a process towards a better understanding of the relationship between human rights and development , and a recognition that economic and social rights are as indispensable as civil and political rights .  
The leaders of the world therefore pledged their political will and their common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries , with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half the 1996 level no later than the year 2015 .  
To ensure an enabling political , social and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and for durable peace , based on full and equal participation of women and men , which is most conducive to achieving sustainable food security for all ;  
The Committee made an important point by emphasizing that in considering sanctions , it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and economic pressure upon the governing lite of the country to persuade them to conform to international law , and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted country .  
While on the one hand every Government should remove obstacles blocking development within its State , such as failure to observe civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , effective international cooperation is essential in providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development , in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Israel has also sought to fulfil another principle it holds dear , as stated in the Declaration of Independence : Israel . . . will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants . . . based on freedom , justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel ; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion , race or sex .  
Rapid advances in technology , growing awareness of the need to preserve Earth and its environment , the increasing potential offered by space activities for economic and social benefits vis - - vis the urgent needs of the developing countries and the changes in the global political scene during the post-cold-war era are sound reasons to deliberate on the role of space in the development of humanity in the twenty-first century .  
I would like in conclusion to express our readiness and sincere desire to work together with all other nations to build a peaceful world in which all people can live happy and productive lives , free from political , social and economic anxieties .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Thanks to this law , the enforcement and development of a private medical-care system part of the national policy on the population 's medical care will pay special attention to women 's health , which is far more sensitive to social and economic changes and to political , cultural and psychological factors . 
This proactive and resolutely political choice is based on a rejection of all forms of discrimination against women , which is the reason why today women are present in all areas of social activity , including in high-level legislative , executive and judicial posts . 
Despite the fact that it has slowed in many countries , the current rate of demographic growth will , in the coming decades , have a considerable impact on economic , social and even political stability in numerous developing countries which are already enduring serious difficulties .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
The current IMF-monitored economic programme put in place in November 1998 as a follow-up to the 1997 / 98 programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and make further progress in the area of structural reform while the political situation settles , and while a possible new enhanced structural adjustment facility programme is being considered .  
It is recognized that there is a vital link between national stability and economic and social development , and that the provision of adequate and sufficient assistance to Haiti is largely subject to a return to political stability .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
In Rwanda , UNHCR has been actively participating in the Rwandan Womens Initiative designed to promote womens rights and participation in political , legislative and judicial arenas and institutions , as well as equal participation in economic and socio-cultural affairs , and to combat violence and other harmful practices against women and young girls .  
Noting the desire and ardent wish of all the political , economic and social actors in the Comoros to see the country return as early as possible to a normal and stable republican system capable of bringing about economic and social development through the establishment of a new institutional framework ,  
Noting that since only 27.5 per cent of the electorate participated in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 , and the law required 50 per cent participation of registered voters for the results to be declared legally valid , the referendum was accordingly declared legally null and void ,  
The main premise guiding INSTRAWs research area is that womens involvement in urban and rural , national and local politics , as well as their untiring efforts to advance womens causes through the mobilization of civil society , contributes not only to gender equality but also to expanding the boundaries of citizenship , democratization , civil society and political decision-making .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitment by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
Without success in this area it is hardly possible to create the stable , just and democratic political environment which in turn is an indispensable precondition for sustainable human , economic and social development .  
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitments by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
UNFPA has encouraged Governments to remove administrative and political obstacles , increase public awareness through all channels , such as the media , formal and other educational programmes , and engage in continuous collaboration and consultation with non _ governmental organizations .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
This is attributable primarily to the determined efforts of my Special Representative , supported by the Russian Federation as facilitator , as well as the group of Friends of the Secretary-General , in insisting to the sides that continuation of the status quo is not an acceptable option , and in encouraging and logistically facilitating bilateral contacts in the fields of culture , humanitarian issues and economic cooperation , as well as on political questions .  
A primary output of the follow-up to the Potsdam conference will be a specific action plan and guidelines towards an integrated process approach , interdisciplinary and multisectoral , thereby comprising sociological , economical , political , organizational , scientific and technological components .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
For the purposes of the present Convention , the term " discrimination against women " shall mean any distinction , exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition , enjoyment or exercise by women , irrespective of their marital status , on a basis of equality of men and women , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
Most Libyan legislative acts are directed at all citizens , irrespective of their sex , and prescribe the body of rights which they enjoy in the political , functional , economic , social , cultural , health and educational fields , without discrimination between men and women , being fundamental rights that are intrinsic to human beings , whether male or female .  
This encouragement demonstrated a conscious political will that recognizes the importance of women in this field in particular , based on sound principles whereby equality between men and women is the means and approach adopted and whereby the advancement of women is an eminent objective to be accomplished with the aim of achieving a free and equal society , as is the motivation of women to assume higher political office .  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
The Council reiterates the importance of a stable and predictable political and economic environment for local and foreign investment and other international financial flows , which remain essential for Africa 's economic and social development .  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The European Union commends the efforts of OAU and all those who have supported it in its search for a peaceful solution to the conflict , which has caused enormous human and physical losses in Ethiopia and Eritrea , jeopardizes political and economic stability in the two countries and in the region , and undermines their capacity to attract foreign support needed for their development .  
The meeting assessed the cooperation between the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields as outlined in General Assembly resolution 53 / 8 .  
In order to build a firm foundation for real and enduring peace and security , it was essential to eliminate the root causes of conflict , be they of a political , ethnic , economic , social or other nature .  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
However , as the years passed , the post-war solidarity gave way to the cold war and instead of one unified covenant , those rights were codified in 1966 in two international covenants - one on civil and political rights , another on economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
As a result of this consensus , there is now no more room for promoting one set of rights as against another , or putting forward some rights , such as economic and social , to be fulfilled prior to or in violation of civil and political rights , or vice versa .  
Civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights have been codified in the International Covenants and ratified by a large number of countries , but the Declaration on the Right to Development does not have the status of a treaty and therefore can not be enforced in a legal system .  
It states : The right to Development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
Then , there is a process of economic , social , cultural and political development , which is recognized as one in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
Most importantly , as constituent components of human rights , these rights have to be achieved following the human rights approach , with full respect for civil and political rights and , with the effective participation of all concerned , equal opportunity of access and fair distribution of the benefits of development .  
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
Currently , such methodologies are less effective than those developed for civil and political rights , although social and economic data from development agencies is increasingly being incorporated into the relevant analysis .  
For example , guidelines for interviews recently prepared for the Kosovo emergency operation and shared with the partners involved in the field refer to both economic , social and cultural and civil and political rights .  
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The outrage duly expressed by the international community , condemning the Taliban as the perpetrators of these killings , and particularly the special attention given to this tragic event by the United Nations as embodied in Security Council resolutions 1193 ( 1998 ) and 1214 ( 1998 ) laid the political , legal and international groundwork for the investigation of the issue , identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murders .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
The factors driving these conflicts which the Seminar identified showed why internal conflicts clearly predominate : ethnic rivalries , general decline in the rule of law , democratic shortcomings on the part of the political authorities , defective governance policies , poverty and underdevelopment , identity-based political demands , politicization of ethnicity , shortcomings in reintegrating former combatants , lack of access to agricultural land , economic difficulties and other factors .  
They noted the multifaceted nature of the concept , which combines political , ideological , economic , social , cultural and ethical criteria , and identified its main elements , such as transparency in public administration , accountability , respect for human rights and legality , promotion of democracy and enhanced management of resources . 
The persistent efforts of States to achieve political ends that serve their national interests entail the misuse , according to established international norms , of , inter alia , radio and television stations with a view to destabilizing the constitutional order of other States considered to be enemies .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
The trend towards ballistic missile defence would be difficult to reverse because the political support in the United States for its development was considerable ; large investments had already been made and committed to further research and development ; and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was often perceived as an obsolete arms control agreement preventing the protection of the territory of the United States .  
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
UNIFEM is committed to intensifying support for programmes that link micro-level and macro-level practical and policy actions in its three thematic areas to meet emerging needs and priorities for gender mainstreaming and for building the capacity of womens organizations as economic and political actors .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
This demonstrates not only the unanimous agreement of the international community on the urgency for the abolition of these obsolete policies , which have been imposed on the Cuban people for so long , but also the common desire for the development of healthy international political relations , the strengthening of international cooperation for the development of all nations , an irreversible trend of the twenty-first century . 
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The Bureau 's report also appears to overlook the balances achieved in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , reaffirmed the universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights and the need for the international community to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  The Bureau 's report , on the one hand , focuses mainly on promoting civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
The demand for concerted global action is shared across a wide geographical and political spectrum among a very large number of countries , although not all of them are affected with equal severity by the direct and indirect consequences of the illicit arms traffic .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The conference will provide an ideal opportunity for a cooperative partnership to be established among Governments , international and regional organizations and the non-governmental community to mobilize public and political support to address the problems associated with the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
The period under review was marked by continuing negotiations , interrupted by repeated discord , and slow progress between the political parties and the Government of Haiti on how to continue to provide essential Government services , such as police and customs services , and how to further the cause of democracy through the organization of legislative and municipal elections .  
In addition , the office would manage any new United Nations civilian mission , facilitate continuing dialogue among key actors in Haiti and the international community , support the democratization process , help to mobilize international political and financial support for Haiti and provide the political framework and focal point for integrating and coordinating the activities of the international community .  
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
Subsequent to two amendments , the indictment includes some 37 counts pertaining to alleged crimes of , inter alia , persecution on political , racial and religious grounds , unlawful deportation and transfer , murder , wilful killing , torture , rape , inhumane acts , cruel treatment and wilfully causing great suffering .  
During the preparatory process for the Conference to review the Non _ Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , scheduled for the year 2000 , we have seen with concern the increasing lack of political understanding between the parties _ nuclear States and non _ nuclear States _ to the said Treaty as to how to progress in a manner which is effective and satisfactory for all the interested parties towards the securing of the ultimate objectives of the NPT .  
To help bring this issue to a just and lasting resolution , the Chinese Government offers encouragement and support to the conflicting parties in Afghanistan so that they can put the interests of their nation and country above everything else , disregard their ethnic , religious and political differences , stop fighting among themselves as soon as possible and establish a broad-based and stable government acceptable to all sides , on the basis of mutual respect and extensive consultations .  
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
The rights of Afghan citizens are protected under the Covenants on political and civil , economic , social and cultural rights , the Geneva Conventions and other international instruments to which Afghanistan is a party , and they must be respected .  
The sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee , attended by a total of 126 States , have been marked by broad support for the draft convention , strong political commitment and the presence of sound technical expertise .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .  
The future of the University is strongly tied to the political and financial support reflected not only in greater numbers of Governments acceding to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace but also in increasing contributions of financial resources for the normal functioning of the University and the launching of new programmes .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 155 of 9 December 1998 , stressed the importance of creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development at the national and international levels .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
This group of nations with different traditions , cultures and historical experiences was brought together by a shared commitment to democracy and a belief that the promise of economic prosperity enjoyed by all citizens is more likely to be realized in a democratic political environment based on respect of human rights , popular participation and the rule of law . 
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
Guided by the desire to contribute , in its own way , to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation , and in line with its foreign policy aimed at contributing to regional peace and security , as well as ensuring the country 's national security by political and diplomatic means , in 1992 , Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
The Seminar was also to review the political , economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories and to identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in the programmes of assistance and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the political and sustainable socio-economic development of the Territories concerned .  
My own country of Saint Lucia , and our Eastern Caribbean sister State of Dominica , share special cultural , economic and social ties with the overseas departments of Guadeloupe , Martinique and French Guyana , which represents the political model of integrated status and whose representatives have been present with us here at this Seminar to discuss the intricacies of that political status .  
The continued and enhanced role of countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific is critical to the future development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories whose economic , political and social advancement can not be successfully addressed separately from the respective regions of which they are an integral part .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The broad human rights approach to disability , therefore , takes the view of advancing the rights and well being of all people , regardless of disabilities , through promotion of implementation of general and disability-specific international instruments that encompass civil and political to economic , social and cultural rights for all .  
In addition to the increased security and political measures taken by the international community , it is the establishment of the Kosovo Transitional Council and the active involvement , on a consultative basis , of political and local leaders in the executive functions of UNMIK that is expected to provide the most important confidence-building mechanism in the medium term for the improvement of the overall situation in Kosovo . 
We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General for his ideas expressed in the report and for his bold approach to the issues of political and military action in cases of systematic and widespread violations of international law , especially those ideas expressed in paragraph 67 of his report .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
Emphasizing that cooperation in political , economic , environmental , humanitarian and security fields contributes to the common goal of a secure , stable and prosperous Baltic and Black Sea space as an integral part of an undivided Europe ;  
It has established regular meetings with the Ministers of Justice in both entities to ensure that political , technical and institutional impediments to the proper functioning of the judiciary are being positively addressed .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
The Netherlands calls for a coherent and integrated approach to conflict prevention and conflict resolution in which the diplomatic , political , military , economic and humanitarian aspects , as well as development assistance , are treated as integral parts .  
The current political context , however , is unfavourable , particularly since those elected will in all likelihood be disinclined to take part in such a seminar until the elections have been held and parliamentary commissions established .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
The executive bodies of the various nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties constitute concrete examples of existing regional arrangements , but their capabilities need to be augmented and their political role needs to be acknowledged by the international community .  
After admitting that the majority of Cubans support Castro , and that there is no effective political opposition , the author of the memorandum stated that the only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship .  
This Conference , which is part of IPUs action to channel parliamentary support to the United Nations , can be a major milestone in efforts made to enhance the peoples understanding of and support to the United Nations through their elected representatives and in identifying ways of relaying United Nations decisions and recommendations more efficiently at the national political level for their effective follow-up .  
After over three decades of an internal armed conflict marked by extreme cruelty , a conflict which was , among other things , an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance , all the indications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas was going to be a complicated and dangerous process .  
Member States shall enhance the process of political consultations and develop cooperation based on mutual interests in the economic , social , humanitarian , environmental , information , scientific and cultural spheres , with each member State making its contribution under conditions of full equality .  
They believe that respect , protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms contribute to political and social stability and peace , to the enrichment of the cultural and spiritual heritage of society as a whole and to mutual understanding and friendly relations between their peoples .  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
At the political and diplomatic level , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries has enhanced extensive and permanent contacts among the seven lusophone countries , aimed at an effective and coherent approach in the international arena .  
For Latvia to succeed , and for the people of Latvia to have the full opportunity they deserve to live secure , healthy and prosperous lives , Latvia must be integrated into the political , business and intellectual exchange of the global community .  
To promote information , education and communication programmes for social mediators , for example , political , religious , educational , cultural , business and union leaders , peer educators , and representatives of non-governmental organizations and the media worldwide , so that they may convey appropriate and accurate messages about drug abuse . 
In order to create and maintain such political will , it is important to give broad publicity to this issue by widely disseminating relevant information on the subject , including the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting and the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly , and above all by publicizing the costs borne by a few countries in supporting the decisions of the Security Council adopted in the name of the international community as a whole .  
In this connection , the recommendation of the representative of the Holy See , made during the preparatory process to the Conference against Racism , is very sound : There is a need to go deeper than historical , cultural , political or social contexts and to identify and understand the spiritual and moral dimensions which underlay the universal human condition and in particular those aspects of it leading to abuses of racial discrimination .  
At the national and international levels , unjust economic , social and political systems which really constitute violations of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights contribute to the birth and / or nurturing of extremism .  
Nigeria and indeed the entire West African subregion have devoted considerable human , material , political and diplomatic resources to the resolution of these crises in the subregion , starting with Liberia and subsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau .  
To this end the Special Rapporteur welcomes the newly-created Stability Pact of the European Union for south-eastern Europe , which outlines a comprehensive approach to the region and promises the States of south-eastern Europe international assistance and eventual integration into European political and economic structures in return for ongoing progress towards democracy , respect for human rights , and regional cooperation .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
In conclusion , while the efforts of the Council to lend its voice to the efforts to halt the excessive accumulation of and traffic in small arms is laudable , we wish to caution that the underlying sociological , economic and political causes of conflict must be addressed so as to create conditions of stability and thus reduce the need for arms and , consequently , for conflict .  
The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
The internal political climate has stabilized and the country continues to move in a peaceful and orderly fashion towards the legislative and presidential elections scheduled for 28 November 1999 .  
The remarkable developments in the course of history , with the victory of Africa and the United Nations over colonialism and apartheid and the disappearance of ideological confrontation in international relations , have established conditions propitious for work on economic and social development and for the building of democratic political systems .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
We look forward to starting the preparation for the summit , which should adopt a balanced approach between political and economic issues , reflecting the global nature of European Union-Africa partnership in order to ensure concrete results . 
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
The construction is telling proof that the United States Government cares little about the political solution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija , and that its main concern is to occupy part of the sovereign territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and establish a long-term presence in the autonomous province of its constituent Republic of Serbia under the guise of participating in the United Nations security presence .  
Since my seventh report to the Council ( S / 1999 / 788 ) , events in the Central African Republic have been dominated to a large extent by the preparations for the presidential election by the Mixed and Independent Electoral Commission ( CEMI ) , which was assisted by MINURCA and various external donors , the campaign by political parties and the first round of the election , which took place on 19 September after two consecutive postponements .  
Being aware that international migration , particularly irregular migration , has increasingly become a major economic , social , humanitarian , political and security concern for a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region ;  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
More broadly speaking , the Kosovo crisis has made it even clearer that only through a comprehensive international effort - at the political , economic and social levels - will the Balkans be able to move from chronic conflict to stability , development and progressive integration in Europe .  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Emphasis must be placed on the Organizations crucial role in addressing the underlying causes of international political crises , including the right to self-determination for peoples under foreign occupation and alien domination , and in the economic and social fields .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
Many formally independent countries were really in a state of dependence because of a growing burden of indebtedness , dwindling official development assistance , and the negative impact of globalization and market liberalization , all aggravated by the imposition of standard political , economic and social models that took no account of differences in identity , culture , degree of development and the like .  
Since it was essential to consolidate the achievements made by addressing the remaining political and operational issues in a balanced and careful manner , he encouraged the parties concerned to continue their cooperation with the United Nations with a view to creating an enabling atmosphere for the referendum to be held as planned .  
It was even more concerned by the slow promotion and facilitation of self-government and by the fact that the utmost effort had not been made to ascertain the free and voluntary choice of the peoples on the political future of their Territories .  
As the new millennium dawned , Bolivia hoped that the United Nations might soon be able to proclaim a world free of colonial vestiges , free of oppression and economic , political and social dependency and respectful of democratic values and fundamental human rights .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
Governments , vulnerable to the threats of withdrawal from transnational companies and to political pressure from voters who were not prepared to change their lifestyles , had difficulty in maintaining social standards and affording the initial cost of moving to environmentally friendly technologies and behaviours .  
Each actor , whether citizen , NGO , enterprise , State or international organization , respect a holistic and integrated approach and to take into consideration the interdependency of the political , social , economic , cultural and environmental factors of development ;  
The United Nations serve as the framework for political , economic , cultural , environmental and moral dialogue and that full use be made of the regional commissions which were the natural link between global and national concerns .  
This fellowship programme aims to give participants , in particular mid-level diplomats and national civil servants dealing with international issues , access to comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills , and possibly other related subjects .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Taking note of the Sarajevo Summit Declaration , in which the participants affirm their collective and individual readiness to give concrete meaning to the Pact by promoting political and economic reforms , development and enhanced security in the region and also their commitment to make every effort to assist countries in the region to make speedy and measurable progress along this road ,  
Human-centred development , the concept outlined at Copenhagen , would enable the poor to enjoy basic political and economic freedoms while focusing on practical and effective ways of alleviating their suffering .  
In a context of economic , political and social globalization and an unprecedented technological revolution , half a century after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , it was inconceivable that some countries should be unwilling to fulfil their commitments in that connection .  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
The Ministers emphasize that resolute opposition to terrorists sheltering behind political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic and religious slogans is in no way aimed at discrimination against any one of those causes .  
The Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which were small island Territories , required and deserved the comprehensive support of the international community , which must assist the Territories to fulfil their aspirations to achieve not only political but also economic , social and cultural well-being .  
At subregional level , an Association of Women of West Africa ( currently chaired by Cte dIvoire ) which had been established by countries of the Economic Community of West African States planned to initiate cultural , social , economic and political programmes for advancing the status of women .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations of the United Nations system and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and its subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated institutions to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social and cultural fields ;  
Emphasizing the importance of the end of a critical period in Central American history and the start of a new phase free from armed conflict , with freely elected Governments in each country and with profound political , economic , social and other changes which have created a climate conducive to the promotion of economic growth and further progress towards the consolidation and further development of democratic , just and equitable societies ,  
In that report , the Secretary-General pointed out that there were a number of special political missions whose resources had previously been provided under the commitment authority granted by the General Assembly to the Secretary-General in its resolutions on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses but whose mandates had been extended with such regular predictability that they could no longer be considered unforeseen .  
If the interpretation is indicative and descriptive , it falls within the purview of sciences such as archaeology , general history , including the history of cultures and civilizations , ethnology , political sociology , social psychology and political philosophy ; if the interpretation is prescriptive , it is a matter for ethics and the moral sciences , philosophy and the legal sciences , international relations and educational psychology .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
To work for the full and timely implementation of the provisions of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and to re-establish the authority of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo throughout its territory , and stresses , in the context of a lasting peaceful settlement , the need for the engagement of all Congolese in an all-inclusive process of political dialogue with a view to achieving national reconciliation and the holding of democratic , free , transparent and fair elections ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
All countries , non-governmental organizations and international organizations concerned needed to be engaged in follow-up , and in that endeavour different methods of implementation , monitoring and evaluation that were sensitive to local cultural , political and religious traditions might be required , as well as active participation of the local population .  
If torture was practised in a State other than in very occasional instances , that meant there was a problem in the body politic and , therefore , in the body administrative ; correcting such problems required firm political will and considerable resources .  However , even though a long-term effort might be necessary , sight should not be lost of the urgency of eliminating torture .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Expresses deep concern about the reported extensive campaign of wiretapping against the independent media and opposition political figures , and calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia to ensure that the media and opposition political figures and parties are not harassed or hindered in their actions or intimidated by government actions and are guaranteed the same protections as representatives of the media or political establishment who are favourable to the Government ;  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Following a brief introduction of the subject by the Chairman-Rapporteur and the independent expert , Ms . Anne-Marie Lizin , the first meeting of the workshop was devoted to a general discussion focusing on three major topics : sociological and political aspects , causes , types and situations of poverty ; the title of a possible draft declaration ; and the main orientations of a possible declaration .  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
Emphasizes that while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests and objectives of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The same perspective was defended during the preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the April 1995 preparatory seminar that constituted a debating forum on the situation of women : the realization of their civic and political rights ; their economic , social and cultural rights ; their reproductive rights and so-called new rights , inter alia , the right to development and quality of life .  
This early positioning for political advantage has taken place in a worsening political climate marked by increased polarization and intolerance , a rise in reports of threats and of acts of intimidation and harassment and continuing mutual mistrust between the political actors and between the latter and the Government , as well as repeated outbreaks of street violence , some undoubtedly politically motivated .  
There were several reported attempts to disrupt the activities of emerging or newly constituted groups , the most egregious example of which was the disruption by pro-Aristide demonstrators of a rally , on 28 May 1999 , organized by the private sector and supported by a wide spectrum of civil society organizations and political parties to protest mounting insecurity and what they termed anarchy .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The creation of a new relationship between Government , society and indigenous peoples must be based on respect for their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and on peaceful dialogue .  
Mr . Wehbe ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that his delegation viewed draft resolution A / C . 3 / 54 / L . 8 , which advocated abolition of the death penalty , as a flagrant violation of the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States and of non-interference in their internal affairs .  It represented an attempt to force other States to change their political , judicial , social and cultural structures .  
Recent calls for such reform were born of a political desire to protect human rights in the context of international consensus , rather than through the unilateral imposition of a single cultural model .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity in the peace and security , political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
With regard to classification , his Governments views were very close to those of UNDP , which had set out seven main categories of threat to human security : economic , food , health , environmental , personal , community and political .  
His delegation reaffirmed its full support for the principles of objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity and its belief that since human rights were indivisible and interdependent , equal importance must be devoted to economic and socio-cultural rights and to civil and political rights .  
Pakistan was concerned by the reference in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( A / 54 / 36 , para . 60 ) to the fact that the Working Group on Common Indicators , established by the United Nations Development Group , was developing civil and political rights indicators to complement existing economic and social indicators .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
It also has an idea of the roots of the problem and has made attempts to address the three key areas of access to justice through changes in the legal and judicial system ; promotion of the democratic process by introducing electoral and other reforms ; and strengthening local communities by trying to initiate dialogue and attempting economic and political empowerment .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
In a pessimistic scenario , increased pressure for an expanded role would undercut the WTOs already precarious level of political support , threatening existing international openness .  
Being the most obvious concrete public organization to hold accountable for the consequences of the otherwise acephalous international trading system creates an obvious potential for political discomfort .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
The idea that the political leaders of developing countries might be able to make use of the WTO to advance shared interests is radical , but the idea that civil society might find in the WTO a vehicle for pursuing interests , which are defined socially rather than nationally , is even more so .  
Since core labour standards are really about protecting the right to organize , and even minor and sporadic international pressure on behalf of this right would be a boon to third world labour movements , established political elites are likely to see core labour standards as a threat to both their local power and the economic strategies that they have adopted in response to globalization .  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were mutually reinforcing , and the international community had a responsibility to ensure a holistic approach to the protection of human rights and the elimination of poverty , one of the most urgent human rights challenges .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Governments had expressed their determination to advance the negotiations , but the political will had been insufficient to put aside the purely economic and commercial interests and give priority to the potential risks that living modified organisms represented for health and for the conservation of the planets biological diversity .  
It not only affected those who were subject to its direct indiscriminate attacks , but it posed a real threat to international peace and security , and endangered the political process in the international arena , including the peace process in the Middle East .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
Urges States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , inter alia , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating those rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Supports the efforts by the High Representative and the multinational Stabilization Force in accordance with the Peace Agreement and subsequent Peace Implementation Council Declarations , to weaken the continued political and economic influence of remaining parallel nationalist structures obstructing the peace implementation ;  
Many countries were unwilling to sustain the increasingly heavy financial , political , environmental and social burdens that resulted from accommodating vast numbers of refugees .  
The National Programme for Sustainable Development , which is being prepared , includes the social , demographic , economic , environmental , educational , ethical and strategic and political aspects of sustainable development , and is aimed at the definition of guidelines for the general development of the country to emphasize the right of every individual to his or her own dignity and development , in accordance with international conventions signed by the Republic of Croatia .  
The development process requires a certain degree of political stability , peace and security at the national , regional and international levels , as well as the establishment of fair and equitable economic relations between States and solid international cooperation , aimed , inter alia , at helping the poorer States to boost their economies and give effect to the right to development .  
The problem of external debt , structural adjustment programmes , economic globalization , unequal access to commercial markets , the collapse of basic commodity prices and speculation in hard currencies are obstacles to development and are detrimental not only to the political independence of developing countries but also to their economic and development policies and their ability to forecast the evolution of their economic situation at the national and international levels .  
New Zealand is firmly committed to the universality and indivisibility of human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued , so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example , in the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
To work for the full and timely implementation of the provisions of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and to re-establish the authority of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo throughout its territory , stressing , in the context of a lasting peaceful settlement , the need for the engagement of all Congolese in an all-inclusive process of political dialogue with a view to achieving national reconciliation and the holding of democratic , free , transparent and fair elections ;  
Strongly supports the efforts made to enable the people of Haiti to express their political will in the forthcoming legislative and local elections , invites all the political leaders of the country to involve themselves in a constructive dialogue , and in this connection , invites the Government of Haiti to ensure the necessary political and security environment for the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the schedule recently announced by the Provisional Electoral Council ;  
Expresses deep concern about the fact that commitments by the Government to improve the freedom of the press have remained unfulfilled , and reaffirms the need for free and independent media and to provide to all political parties equal access to all forms of media during the forthcoming electoral campaign ;  
Expresses deep concern about the reported extensive campaign of wiretapping against the independent media and opposition political figures , and calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia to ensure that the media and opposition political figures and parties are not harassed or hindered in their actions or intimidated by government actions and are guaranteed the same protections as representatives of the media or political establishment who are favourable to the Government ;  
Supports the efforts by the High Representative and the multinational Stabilization Force in accordance with the Peace Agreement and subsequent Peace Implementation Council Declarations , to weaken the continued political and economic influence of remaining parallel nationalist structures obstructing the peace implementation ;  
Socialism had different related meanings : it represented an intellectual trend based on the critique of the developing bourgeois society ; it was the expression of a political and social movement aiming at reforms , influence or power ; and it referred to an ideal economic and social system intended to replace and overcome capitalism and its perceived flaws .  
This new development , and the co-evolution that resulted between the two families of historical national economies the capitalist and the socialist deeply influenced and modified the three other dimensions ( intellectual , political and normative ) of socialism inherited from the previous century .  
In these trajectories , interdependent phenomena of political change , institutional shift , macroeconomic trends and social tendencies have generally reinforced each other and produced specific configuration of cumulative causation processes .  
In such a process , all elements of the economic system , of the juridical sphere and of the political regime undergo profound transformations , while social differences are reshaped , cultural values are modified , and the international environment also changes .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
The main thrust of Namibias national action programme to combat decertification was that the social , economic , legal and political environment should be reconciled with the natural environment in order to enhance the sustainable use of natural resources .  
Not only should the existing status and role of the Committee in the formulation of political and legal principles governing space activities be preserved , but its functions of coordinating and regulating international cooperation in space should be strengthened .  
He is also of the view that the dedicated protection of selected United Nations personnel undertaking operations at locations where intimidation and resistance is likely , would provide the confidence essential for more effective police operations and legal proceedings against entrenched political and criminal interests .  
The Mexican Government , which accorded high priority to promoting the full participation of women in social , economic , political and cultural life on a par with men , devoted significant resources to programmes designed to eliminate poverty using a gender-specific perspective , and to training women in non-traditional activities ; it was also encouraging independent employment and the creation of microbusinesses , in view of regional , social and gender realities .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to pursuing all possible steps to ensure that women had full enjoyment of their basic human rights and were equal partners in shaping the economic , political and social life of the country .  
The interviews with political , military and police authorities , public officials , accused persons , witnesses and victims of the attacks , and members of the public chosen at random in Havana , formed a body of first-hand material as a basis for as thorough and objective an investigation as possible into the subject assigned to the Special Rapporteur .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments are all based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
These grounds are : sex ; marital status ; religious belief ; ethical belief ; colour , race , ethnic or national origin ( which includes nationality or citizenship ) ; disability ; age ; political opinion ; employment status ; family status ; or sexual orientation .  
Ms . Faetanini ( San Marino ) said that the General Assembly , at its twentieth special session , had stressed that drug supply and demand were closely linked and had placed the drug problem in its true perspective by emphasizing its social , economic and political implications .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of both civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights .  
The ambitious intention to transform the Council into a more representative , more democratic , more open , more transparent , and hence more effective body makes for an extraordinarily complex and delicate task that requires effort and time , enormous patience and firm political will from all participants in the exercise .  
The note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
More broadly speaking , the Kosovo crisis has made it even clearer that only through a comprehensive international effort at the political , economic and social levels will the Balkans be able to move from chronic conflict to stability , development and progressive integration in Europe .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
The preservation and extension of its achievements , coupled with revitalization of the moral authority and political relevance of the United Nations in the coming millennium , require restoration of the fundamental purposes and principles of the United Nations , as well as a rational , transparent and participatory process of reassessment of the existing institutions .  
But the more usual reaction to the mismatch between economic geography and the political geography of state boundaries has been defensive or a sterile triumphalism : a new protectionism , xenophobic or nostalgic nationalisms or , where a country feels strong and confident enough , a new kind of extraterritoriality , reminiscent of the nineteenth century .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
We can not deny that uncontrolled market forces and unfettered short-term capital flows , to take but a few examples of globalization , have had devastating consequences on our economies , social cohesion , political stability and cultural identity in many cases for the worse rather than for the better . 
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
They will continue as usual to follow their economic , educational , political and social development plans and programmes , knowing that the end of the twentieth century will not automatically mean an end to current regional conflicts .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
I am confident that over the next two days the debate will be characterized by new ideas and a renewed commitment to the Proclamation on Ageing , which calls for the recognition of humanity ' s demographic coming of age and the promise it holds for maturing attitudes and innovations in political , legal , social , economic , cultural and spiritual fields as our collective and determined way of preparing ourselves towards social justice , global peace , human development equality in the next century . 
To this end , we envisage measures to benefit all sectors of the older population , taking care to ensure that needs are met for those living in the countryside and in outlying urban areas , older women , disabled older persons and all groups of older persons who because of their race , culture , religion , economic situation or political ideas might have limited access to all kinds of services and comprehensive care .  
In conclusion , may I express my delegation ' s sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit will help generate the renewed political will at the national and international levels that is so needed to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
On employment , the special session will have to give vigorous political impetus to the creation of a global strategy , under the leadership of the International Labour Organization and its tripartite structures for participation , which will lay the foundations for the sustained creation of productive employment in the future .  
We must give special attention to following up the results achieved at Geneva next June , with a particular eye to translating the agreements from the global perspective of the General Assembly to their regional and national dimensions , with a view to consolidating a political culture in favour of social progress , to use the phrase employed at the Copenhagen meeting that marked the beginning of the social Summit .  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
He did not give us a descriptive report , but one based on his prerogatives , responsibilities and discretionary powers , putting forward a vision and initiatives to confront what he views as threats to international peace and security and ideas on how the United Nations could respond to political , humanitarian and human rights crises .  
In the context of legislative and legal guarantees and taking into account the balance between the needs of the individual and those of society , my country has adopted several political , social and economic measures aimed at the maximum utilization of human resources and the improvement of living standards .  
In Tanzania , the Government undertook a comprehensive reform programme covering all the social , political and economic sectors with the objective of making them more responsive , efficient and accountable to the people .  
Armenia believes that efficient and effective cooperation among the Black Sea countries will help consolidate the strategic economic potential inherent in this area , promote free trade , open roads and other means of communication and foster the welfare of peoples , thus stimulating the peaceful settlement of existing political disputes and reinforcing the independence , sovereignty and democratic development of the BSECO member States . 
Conflicts will continue as long as the North continues to impose an imperfect and environmentally and economically unsustainable political model that may , perhaps , work in the North a model reached after centuries of absolute monarchies , without free or just elections , without universal suffrage , without women having the vote , without eight-hour work days , without what today is called good governance , though this concept has yet to be defined or agreed on by anybody .  
If the political manipulation of human rights continues the selectivity , partiality and double standards ; if economic and social rights are ignored ; if the right to development is disregarded ; if a sectarian and abstract international human rights law is imposed ; and if all human rights are not guaranteed for all human beings conflicts will continue .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
While emphasizing the imperative need for the political will on the part of States to facilitate the access of needy populations to assistance and cooperation , it seems to us equally valuable that the Secretary-General has included , as the first point in his annual report , a reference to the importance of developing a culture of prevention to deal with natural disasters . 
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
In affirmation of the growing needs and common requirements of the member States of the OIC , General Assembly resolution 53-16 of 29 October 1998 called for the strengthening of cooperation between our two organizations in the political , social , economic and humanitarian fields , a detailed review of which is contained in the Secretary-General ' s report .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
On the occasion of the signing we were able to show him some of the progress we have made and reiterate our political will to work for a strengthened , effective and efficient safeguards system , based on an equitable regime that will lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Our strong moral , political and financial support for the Tribunal will ensure not only that future dictatorial regimes will be effectively prosecuted for their actions , but that there will never be a repeat of genocide in our continent or , indeed , worldwide .  
Since the ultimate objective of these measures is to undermine international peace and security and create political and economic instability in other countries , the Islamic Republic of Iran , like other members of the international community , advocates the removal and elimination of all economic and trade embargoes imposed upon Cuba , and believes that differences between States should be settled in a peaceful manner .  
Recognizing the importance of a sound economy to social and political stability , the European Union will continue its considerable economic and technical assistance to the Palestinians with a view to contributing to a more secure and prosperous future for them in the next millennium .  
Continued financial assistance from the international community for the Bethlehem 2000 project is needed for the creation of a strong , self-sufficient and sustainable economic infrastructure for Bethlehem that would provide a sound underpinning for social and political stability , which is a prerequisite for peace in the region .  
We also believe that the Bethlehem 2000 project has a distinct spiritual value , over and above other important economic concerns , and that this event , which commemorates the birth of Christ , must be shielded from harmful and unnecessary political hindrances that could frustrate its legitimate goal .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
In implementing that resolution the two institutions set up cooperative machinery , thanks to a cooperative agreement designed to strengthen their ties on issues of common interest , notably in the political , economic , scientific and cultural areas .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
It is significant that throughout the political campaign leading to the first round of general elections , held just 12 days ago , and whose final outcome will be decided in the run-off scheduled for 26 December , each and every one of the political parties , without exception , expressed full support for the implementation of the peace agreements , as well as for the continued presence in Guatemala of the Verification Mission . Indeed , MINUGUA forms an integral part of those Agreements . 
For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
Although humanitarian action takes place in contexts in which political , economic , social and military factors are inextricably connected , it is absolutely vital for humanitarian institutions to preserve the strictly non-political and impartial character of their mission .  
At the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies on Democracy and Development , held at Bucharest , Romania , two years ago , the representatives of new or restored democracies noted that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to the political , economic and social problems that our societies face .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
The Government and the civil society of Yemen are working closely and strenuously to make democracy an irreversibly solid trend of national policy and an evolutionary process , so that democracy will ultimately become the focal point of political , social and economic life in Yemen .  
At our second Conference , held in Managua in 1994 , we took another important step when we adopted the Managua Declaration and Plan of Action , which addressed issues relating to the political and reconciliation processes within national societies , human rights and the right of all nations to development , economic reforms , structural adjustment programmes and other problems facing democratic States .  
Here we saw the iron curtain descend on Europe , that line of separation which subsequently hung for several decades and embodied multi-faceted confrontation ideological , political , military and economic confrontation between totalitarian and democratic systems .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
But we must remember that it is a process : a series of steps which build upon each other so that the final result , which we firmly believe to be achievable , will have come about through gradual , careful and deliberate negotiation and not through imperfect solutions imposed from outside or as a consequence of inherent power imbalances or short-term political expediency .  
We are convinced that expanding our interaction with the OSCE will help reinforce security and stability in our region on the basis of the fundamental , universal and democratic values , principles and obligations of the OSCE , taking into account the specific national features and traditions of our country and its political and social experience .  
Mr . Gatilov ( Russian Federation ) ( spoke in Russian ) : Today ' s discussion is taking place against the backdrop of the major political outcomes of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) Istanbul summit , which laid down the basic guidelines for the formation of a stable architecture for security and cooperation on the European continent in the twenty-first century on the basis of the United Nations Charter and generally recognized principles of international law . 
In this connection , CARICOM reiterates its long-standing view that these studies and analyses called for in the plan of action are vital to a systematic and complete assessment on the part of the international community of the prevailing economic , political and social conditions in all of the Non-Self-Governing Territories as they progress towards a full measure of self-government .  
A cursory review of the political and constitutional development of the remaining mostly small island Non-Self-Governing Territories , makes it evident that none of them have met the essential criteria of full and absolute political equality , as defined by the General Assembly in its landmark resolutions .  
We are committed to working in partnership with Africa to secure peace and democracy , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , political stability and economic and social development .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
Two months later , at Sirte in Libya , the fourth extraordinary session of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU considered the ways and means of strengthening the organization with a view to rendering it more effective and adaptable to social , political and economic changes and to making it the preferred instrument for collective action for Africa and for cooperation with the rest of the world .  
There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
The armed conflicts that have for years been tearing apart the Horn of Africa and Central Africa have resulted in thousands of deaths , orphans , refugees and displaced persons in brief , an unprecedented humanitarian disaster compounded by the collapse of economic and social and , sometimes , political infrastructures .  
The third specific characteristic of the current efforts for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the creation and functioning of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe , which has , in the five months of its existence , completed the important evolution from political declaration to operational international mechanism .  
It has weighty legal , political and strategic implications , since it affects one of the vital organs of the United Nations , entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security and thereby vulnerable to the subtle interplay of the interests of the Powers , sometimes to the detriment of the very cause of maintaining international peace and security that it is supposed to promote .  
Indeed , all agree to recognize that , in the wake of substantial upheavals on the international scene , the membership and present structure that were dictated by the world situation of 1945 have become obsolete and anachronistic and do not reflect the political and economic realities of our era nor , a fortiori , those of the coming millennium .  
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
The economic and political developments in international relations ; the far-reaching changes that have taken place , particularly in the wake of the end of the cold war ; and the accession of many new States to the membership of the United Nations all have made it imperative that the Security Council be reformed , its membership increased and its methods of work and activities made more effective in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
We are aware , however , that the full potential of confidence-building can be developed only in conjunction with further political steps that require the steady , persistent and sometimes painstaking effort of the international community .  
The five principles of peaceful coexistence make up the political foundation underpinning world peace ; mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity constitute the economic guarantee for world peace ; dialogue , consultations and negotiations between the parties concerned on an equal footing represent the correct approach to resolving disputes and safeguarding peace.In this context , we call on the international community to take this new security concept as a guideline .  
Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Over the last quarter-century , through an exhaustive and inclusive process of dialogue and discussion and through programmes of action and international cooperation , population has become part of the global dialogue on economic and social development.It has become part of every countrys political thinking and planning .  
Not only have we had to battle against established customs and the preachings of a number of conservative sectors , we also although this may be difficult to believe have had to deal with a number of non-governmental organizations which , when they did not get the budgetary support they expected , joined the campaign being waged by some parts of the media and certain political sectors and , betraying their principles , acted in opposition to the reproductive health programmes .  
Women are occupying more important positions in everyday life , and the numbers of women participating in all economic , cultural , political , social and intellectual activities has increased significantly .  
In this connection , we appeal also for resolute action by Governments to strengthen their political will in respect of establishing effective and transparent partnerships , both at the national level with civil society and at the bilateral level .  
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
The League of Arab States was a participant in regional and international preparatory meetings relating to population issues , which demonstrates our deep interest in this subject and our conviction that it is the role of mankind to work towards social development and to participate in political and national security affairs whether in our region or in the world at large .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
The Working Group expressed its deep concern in relation to the continuing grave violations of womens human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the persistent and pervasive discrimination against women .  
The Working Group was concerned at the allegations of the violations of the human rights of women , including widespread arbitrary arrest , use of excessive force during arrests , incommunicado detention , prolonged administrative detention , detention of minors , torture and ill-treatment , unfair trial and forcible exile of political opponents and prisoners .  
Representatives agreed that the creation of an enabling environment that includes a legislative framework and political commitment at the highest level is a prerequisite for effective social change and improvement in womens health .  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
The Committee recommends that the State party accord equal treatment to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in terms of their domestic legal status and that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations consideration be given to similar measures in relation to economic , social and cultural rights .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
Indeed , at its forty-ninth session in August 1997 , the Sub-Commission adopted resolution 1997-7 in which it requested one of its experts , Mr . Mustapha Mehedi , to prepare a working paper on the right to education with the purpose of explaining the content of the right to education , taking account , in particular , of its social dimension and the freedoms it includes and of its dual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural character .  
The World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993 underscored the interdependence of all human rights , and emphasized that all societies should work to ensure the enjoyment by all their members of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including their right to development .  
The Convention codifies women ' s right to non _ discrimination and equality with men and also establishes that women and men are equally entitled to the full enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural , civil or any other field .  
To that end , they pledge to increase their efforts to assess factors and obstacles that impinge on women ' s enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social , cultural and other rights and to suggest specific actions on how such obstacles might be overcome so that full enjoyment of human rights by all , without discrimination , may be realized .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
The Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom knows better than anyone else that the methods he has been employing in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are prompted by narrow political considerations inimical to Iraq and have played a large part in impeding implementation of the oil-for-food programme and in delaying the arrival of foodstuffs and basic necessities covered by the provisions of this programme .  
Yet it further stated that , apart from the statistical definition of the term youth mentioned above , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and sociocultural circumstances .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
Recent international meetings on population issues , including the high-level regional meeting concerning Asia and the Pacific that had been held recently in Bangkok , had contributed to the establishment of the political commitment needed to integrate developmental , population and environmental strategies at global , regional , national and local levels .  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the activities carried out by the United Nations system , as well as the observations and recommendations contained in the report , with respect to building a political culture through human rights observance , mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , free and independent media , enhancing the rule of law and improving accountability , transparency and quality of public sector management and democratic structures of government ;  
In the current international context , characterized by growing interdependence and globalization , it is essential for Member States to show greater political will by intensifying dialogue and joint undertakings and strengthening international cooperation through confidence-building measures , which can reduce tension and the risk of armed confrontation between States .  
While supporting the principle that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lay with States , his delegation wished to underline in that regard that initiatives aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political unity of independent and sovereign States must not be encouraged .  
It had consistently maintained that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be carried out in strict compliance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , as stated in the Charter of the United Nations , and on the basis of the traditional fundamental principles of peacekeeping such as the consent of the parties , impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
What the Convention will do is create a system that makes that extremely difficult as a practical matter , because of its system of monitoring sensitive chemicals , its challenge inspection provisions , its economic and political sanctions , and by creating a forum for determining collective action to combat the threat of chemical weapons .

The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
Secondly , clear definitions of terms loosely used in the previous report , such as illegal , legitimate , power and control , should be established in relation to the specific and unique political situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region .

The exceptional complexity of this precarious situation in terms of security , humanitarian , economic , social and political matters can no longer be addressed through piecemeal , sectoral or ad hoc responses .

In this context , the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan already last Friday sent identical letters to the Secretary-General and to yourself , Sir .  
First , the peace process in the Congo has lately witnessed a number of consecutive steps that have served to maintain the current momentum aimed at implementing the Lusaka Agreement in both its military and political components and at reaching a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict , which has been tearing the Congo apart and draining the energies of its neighbours for almost three years .

In the countries middle of an acute crisis and we have several examples of such crises in Africa the United Nations and the donors face the worst possible conditions in war-torn and occupied countries , with their resources sometimes plundered , and with a lack of clear political prospects for restoring trust among the people .

A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
In this respect , the presence of political leaders who are prepared to handle social complaints and demands by violent means with a view to satisfying selfish political and economic ambitions is the real cause of , and an inevitable catalyst of , social violence and armed conflicts .  
In Zaire and in Haiti , the armed conflicts resulted from the actions of hardened , corrupt , dictatorial governments that turned their backs on the civilian population and established violence as the norm of political discourse and squandered national resources .

This public meeting is an ideal opportunity for my delegation to pay a warm tribute to the Special Representative , all the staff of UNTAET and all the Members of the East Timor Transitional Administration for the steps they have taken in the political process leading to the national and international sovereignty of East Timor and the emergence of an independent East Timorese Government .  
The fact that these parties have committed themselves to respecting the ballot results , to conducting themselves peacefully with mutual respect and to defending pluralistic democracy clearly attests to the maturity of the East Timorese political leaders and their determination to establish the bases of a solid democratic and an economically viable State .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
In its presidential statement on peace-building , adopted last February , the Council also reiterated that efforts to ensure lasting solutions to conflicts and to maintain the momentum for peace in any given country or region require increased solidarity , sustained political will and timely and adequate resources on the part of the international community .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
However , we strongly believe that the dynamic of the entire peace process can be maintained and moved forward only if the responsibilities and the political will of the parties is fulfilled and translated into real action .  
The Security Council , having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 11 October 2001 ( S / 2001 / 963 ) and having held a public meeting on 19 October 2001 ( S / PV . 4392 and S / PV . 4392 resumption 1 ) , reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia , consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and bearing in mind its respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity , political independence and unity of Somalia .  
We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia , for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made .  
On the national level , Tunisia has found efficient solutions through the implementation of a comprehensive strategy political , economic , social , cultural and educational as well as strengthening the rule of law and government institutions , thereby distancing ourselves from threats of terrorism and violence .  
My Government , the British Government , has a simple message for terrorists and those who support terrorism : terrorism , the deliberate targeting of innocent people for political ends , is criminal , and there is no political , religious or ideological cause which can possibly justify the use of such indiscriminate violence .  
The Presidents of the two countries , General Pervez Musharraf and Mr . Mohammad Khatami , assured me in no uncertain terms that , because the see the establishment of a stable and representative Government accountable to all Afghans to be in their own national interests , they would like the United Nations to play a pivotal role in the process of finding a political solution .  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
We should like to stress once again that responsible political management , combined with an absolute and immediate determination to implement institutional , legal and economic reforms in full , are essential prerequisites for speedy integration into European Union structures .  
That can become a reality only if coercive and firm measures are taken against the FDD and FNL armed groups , which have stepped up their violent actions against the innocent population since the establishment of the transitional Government , and which no longer have any political justification for turning a deaf ear to appeals for negotiation and ceasefire . 
We note with interest the remark contained in paragraph 10 of the report that the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , regardless of the political system or governing authority in place , has been one of systematic abuse of its natural and human resources , such that a country noted for its vast natural resources was reduced to being one of the poorest and debt-ridden by the early 1990s . 
Were the Council to fail to effectively assume its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security or to contain the volatile situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , we fear that , given the inability of the other parties to achieve concrete progress in prevailing upon the Israeli Government to accept steps that would lead to a political solution , the situation would become yet more tense and would get completely out of control , having a very negative impact on the stability of this vital part of our world .  
Article 1 , paragraph 1 , of the Declaration of 1986 states : The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The article spells out three principles : first , there is a human right called the right to development which is inalienable ; second , there is a particular process of economic , social , cultural and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized ; and third , the right to development is a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to and enjoy that particular process of development .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
It refers to the realization of all the rights and freedoms recognized as human rights - civil and political rights and economic and social and cultural rights - in their totality as an integrated whole , as all these rights are interrelated and interdependent .  
He described the right to development as a vector composed of various elements including the right to food , the right to health , the right to education , the right to housing and other economic , social and cultural rights , as well as all the civil and political rights together with the rates of growth of GDP and other financial , technical and institutional resources that enable any improvement in the well-being of the entire population and the realization of the rights to be sustained .  
Since the right to development has been recognized as a human right distinct from the individual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , it is indeed necessary to consider a monitoring mechanism that is separate from the treaty bodies .  
All forms of human rights civil , cultural , economic , social and political are integral and indivisible rights of our peoples .  
Confident of the contributions that Bahrain , under the leadership of its Amir , His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa , can make to consolidating and strengthening the GCC process during its presidency of the Councils forthcoming session in order to guide it towards new horizons that will enable it to cope in a positive manner with the rapid and continuous changes required by the process of globalization at the political , economic , social and cultural levels ,  
Reinforcement and strengthening of the GCC process in terms of enhanced coordination , cooperation , interlinkage and integration , by adopting a unified strategy in the political , economic , security , military , social , information , cultural and scientific fields based on unity of purpose and a common destiny .  
At the special session of the General Assembly , Governments included corporate social responsibility towards development as one of the elements under commitment 1 to creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
It had expressed regret , however , that full information on the preliminary estimate of resources was not available in the proposed budget outline , despite the fact that in its resolution 53 / 206 , the General Assembly had requested that provisions should be made in the budget outline for expenditures for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved in the course of the biennium .  
COHCHR has also received allegations of police violence and excessive use of force , summary and extrajudicial execution , disappearance , mob killings , torture , political intimidation and violence against members of political parties , in particular the opposition party , including instances of extrajudicial execution , interference of the executive in judicial matters , curtailment of the freedom of association and expression and intimidation of human rights defenders .  
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments assert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The Declaration provides guidance for realizing development and human rights in a complementary and comprehensive manner , and identifies international cooperation as a duty of the international community ; in this framework , international cooperation should focus on the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the formulation of international development policies for ensuring development and eliminating obstacles thereto .  
UNOMIG reported that in several regions of Georgia , including Abkhazia , one of the greatest threats to the local population , representatives of the international humanitarian organizations and United Nations personnel , seemed to come from loosely organized and poorly commanded paramilitary organizations , some of which may be supported by political circles while others were exclusively criminally motivated .  
Democracy is a system of universal values and is based on recognition of the inalienable nature of the dignity and equal value of all human beings ; everyone has the right to play an active role in social , professional and political life and to enjoy the right to development ;  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
To ensure true respect for freedom of the press and equal access of the various political forces to the public and private media , whether written or audio-visual , under a regulatory system that is in line with democratic principles ;  
Turkmenistan has consistently and insistently supported the establishment in international relations of a more humane , equitable and constructive order , opposed all forms of discrimination , the isolation of States on political or ideological grounds and the imposition of various types of economic sanctions , embargoes and the like , and urged respect for the distinctive characteristics of each country and its chosen model of social and political development .  
Despite the economic war waged against Cuba for nearly four decades , the position achieved by women in society , their cultural , technical and professional level , their high rates of economic , political and social participation , and the radical changes in their attitudes and lives were significant indicators of social progress .  
The Court should not be subject to political pressure ; rather , it must be a respectable , credible institution that would prevent certain States from committing regrettable acts such as allowing their judicial officers to recklessly prosecute the political leaders of other sovereign , independent States with whose policies they disagreed ; it should also put a final end to State terrorism of the type currently engaged in by Rwandans , Ugandans and Burundians against his country . 
However , a glance at the present pattern of armed conflicts , whether internal or international , and the fact that mercenaries are involved in most of them would seem to confirm the opinion held by the Office of the Special Rapporteur , namely , that mercenary activities are continuing in many parts of the world and that the presence of mercenaries is still connected with situations that affect the self-determination of peoples as well as peace , political stability , life , physical integrity , freedom and security .  
These killings are symptoms of deeply rooted and complex social , economic and political problems coupled with surging crime rates , which continue to plague the human rights situation in these countries .  
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
The definition and methodology lacked clarity , and the concept seemed more appropriate for a multinational corporation for which profit was paramount than for a multilateral international organization pursuing sensitive and complex political and socio-economic objectives agreed upon by consensus .  
The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna had reached consensus on areas for action and objectives for the promotion of human rights , which no longer covered only civil and political rights but also , on an equal footing , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The policy of civil harmony , introduced by the President of the Republic and clearly ratified by popular referendum , the goodwill and clemency measures , and the unusual openness in the political arena and among the communications media reflected the determination of the Algerian people and of the public authorities to continue to strengthen the democratic process , creating a genuine culture of human rights and a more just society , without fear or arbitrariness .  
The unhealthy tendency to overstate alleged violations of civil and political rights with a view to satisfying special interest groups or domestic constituencies had become a characteristic of the Third Committees country-specific draft resolutions .  
The Administration was determined to pursue its current efforts to consolidate its achievements in social , cultural , economic and political fields , and to intensify its endeavours to ensure the progressive enjoyment of all aspects of human rights by the people of Myanmar .  
A high-level council for human rights had been established , with links to international organizations and local non-governmental organizations , and efforts were being made to involve the people in public life , especially through the establishment of non-governmental organizations in the human rights field dealing with political , social and economic questions .  
The ability of the Office of the High Commissioner to take action must be strengthened in order to further the realization of economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights and to reinforce coordination between the Office and other international and regional organizations with a view to facilitating better analysis of the situation in that area and the adoption of preventive measures .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
As the UNDP Resident Representative in Malabo had informed the Minister in a letter dated 4 February 2000 , technical and financial assistance in connection with the elections was made conditional on a mission to evaluate the conditions in which the electoral process would take place as well as the existence of prior agreement on United Nations involvement throughout the electoral process and the unrestricted participation of candidates of all political parties .  
In brief , those conclusions found that in Equatorial Guinea any person can be deprived of liberty with no effective judicial remedy , and even subjected to torture , as a result of the profound distrust entertained by the Government towards any form of dissidence , which has prevented the political agreements concluded since 1993 between the governing party and opposition parties from ever being given effect .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
His Government had always attached great importance to the protection of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , as reflected in his countrys Constitution , which guaranteed all citizens those rights .  
It complied with international human rights instruments and conventions on the basis of its historical , religious , economic and cultural heritage , always within the framework of political pluralism , freedom of expression and elected representation in peoples assemblies and local bodies and in popular organizations covering all sectors of the population .  
In 1975 , after enduring periods of foreign domination , colonization and neo-colonialism , his countrys multi-ethnic people had chosen a political system suited to their historical , economic , social and cultural particularities .  
For that reason his delegation had sponsored resolutions on the protection and security of small States in 1989 , 1991 and 1994 and remained convinced that a long-term solution to the problem required , among other things , the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to assist small States in protecting their security , sovereignty and territorial integrity in time of need .  Such assistance should be regarded as a political and moral obligation on the part of the international community .  
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
The challenge ahead requires [ adequate ] [ new and additional ] financial resources , technology transfer , and , where appropriate , political will , as well as commitment to innovative ways of applying energy efficient , environmentally sound and cost-effective technologies and systems to all sectors of the economy .  
The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
The need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction whatsoever , was also underlined .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
The Court , inter alia , said : The political decision not to end the conflict by violent means but to seek negotiated and concerted solutions is an act of sovereignty on the part of the State , since it adopts exceptional measures to deal with an irregular situation , recover its capacity to suppress and punish crime and bring fresh impetus to a just , social , political and economic order which truly protects and secures human rights .  
The Government also wishes to record its categorical disagreement with and rejection of the double-counting and descriptions in the report of the appalling acts committed by the paramilitary groups , firstly speaking of violations of civil and political rights and secondly referring to violations of the terms of international humanitarian law as expressed in conventions and customary law .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
The Committee recommends that the general principles of the Convention , in particular the provisions of its articles 2 , 3 and 12 , be appropriately integrated in all relevant legislation concerning children and applied in all political , judicial and administrative decisions and in projects , programmes and services which have an impact on all children , including non-citizen children , and guide the determination of policy-making at every level and actions taken by social and health welfare institutions , courts of law and administrative authorities .  
The Committee is concerned that the principles of non-discrimination ( art . 2 of the Convention ) , best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and respect for the views of the child ( art . 12 ) are not fully reflected in the State partys legislation and political , administrative and judicial decisions , as well as in its policies and programmes relevant to children both at the national and the local level .  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .  
The Ministerial Council then reviewed the outcome of the meetings of a number of ministerial and technical committees held for the purpose of promoting joint action as well as the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The Ministerial Council reviewed the Israeli practices of aggression against the Palestinian people , especially the escalation against towns , villages and camps , and the policy of closures and economic and political blockade being pursued by Israel against the fraternal Palestinian people demanding the restoration of its legitimate rights , including the right of return and its right to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
The increasing problems of organized crime , illegal trafficking , economic stagnation and political instability can be adequately dealt with only within a regional framework and with a unified international approach .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Reaffirm that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political process , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ;  
In doing so , I recalled the expectations of the international community for rapid progress by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian Governments on the implementation of the political , economic and social confidence-building measures set out in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian plan for the region , independent of other progress in negotiations with the ethnic Albanian representatives .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) United Nations organizations are willing to cooperate ; ( b ) all parties concerned display the necessary political will ; ( c ) sufficient human and financial resources are available ; and ( d ) the economic and political situation of African countries is stable .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Also reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Strongly reaffirm that States which pursued racist policies or acts of racial discrimination such as slavery and colonialism should assume their moral , economic , political and legal responsibilities within their national jurisdiction and before other appropriate international mechanisms or jurisdictions and provide adequate reparation to those communities or individuals who , individually or collectively , are victims of such racist policies or acts , regardless of when or by whom they were committed ;  
The major political commitment of States is to take enhanced international action against corruption , through existing instruments , a new binding global legal instrument against corruption and other measures .  
The transition to a child rights approach can be hampered by : conservative economic and social policies characterized by paternalism and political patronage ; the insufficient capacity of local-level bodies to assume the new responsibilities ; the continued application of archaic law regarding minors ; resistance to child rights concepts by executive , legislative and / or judicial officials ; and the absence of valid , timely and relevant data and indicators on the fulfilment and violation of rights .  
Although a few women have achieved high social status in modern political , economic or professional life , the situation of the average woman , especially in rural areas , remains dire .  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Strongly condemns extremist violence in certain municipalities in southern Serbia and welcomes the plan of the Federal and Republic Governments to resolve the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia peacefully , including political and economic reform designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society , and calls for a rapid implementation of the plan ;  
Stresses however its deep concern about the continued repression of members of the political opposition and about the detention of dissidents and all other persons detained or imprisoned for peacefully expressing their political , religious and social views and for exercising their right to full and equal participation in public affairs , and calls upon the Government of Cuba to release all those persons ;  
In collaboration with UNICEF and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the Government was instituting peace and reconciliation initiatives , and considered that there was a need to assess and remedy the emotional damage suffered by traumatized children and to adopt an integrated , action-oriented approach which combined the elements of social policy , political will , economic commitment and efforts to mobilize adequate funds .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
The Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Council in its resolution 11 ( II ) of 21 June 1946 to prepare recommendations and reports to the Council on promoting womens rights in political , economic , civil , social and educational fields and to make recommendations to the Council on urgent problems requiring immediate attention in the field of womens rights with the object of implementing the principle that men and women shall have equal rights , and to develop proposals to give effect to such recommendations .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999 , decided to convene a high-level international intergovernmental event , involving political decision makers at least at ministerial level , to consider national , international and systemic issues relating to financing for development in a holistic manner in the context of globalization and interdependence .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
Reaffirms that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives , and that in order to achieve this , full popular participation , equity , social justice and non-discrimination should be strengthened ;  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .  The conference should define the political principles to be applied at both the national and the international level , as well as the collective objectives and goals to be attained and the means needed to accomplish this .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
Reaffirming its commitment to the process of democratization of States , and recognizing that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
The period following his election , until his inauguration as President on 7 February was marked by a concerted civil society effort to promote political dialogue ; questionable opposition moves to form an alternative government ; and a climate of tension and threats accompanied by intermittent bombings .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Underscore the need to promote strategies , programmes and policies , which may include measures of affirmative action , for furthering the fulfilment of civil and political rights for victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including through more effective access to the political , judicial and administrative functions of institutions , as well as the need to increase access to the administration of justice in all its forms , free from racial discrimination of any kind ;  
Urge States to reaffirm their democratic commitment and take the necessary legislative , administrative and judicial measures , in accordance with their obligations under regional and international human rights instruments , to condemn and actively discourage all forms of propaganda , publicity , organizations , associations , political parties or groups inspired by ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or ethnic group and that seek to justify or promote racial hatred , xenophobia or racial discrimination ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Urge States to give priority to promoting and protecting the full and equal enjoyment by women and men of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind as to race , colour , gender , sexual orientation , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Urge those States in which the political and legal systems do not reflect their multiracial , multi-ethnic , multilingual and multicultural realities to review those systems , in consultation with representatives of the affected groups , with a view to improving democratic institutions so that they are more fully participatory and avoid marginalization , exclusion and discrimination of specific sectors of society , including indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other victims of racism ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in preparing his analytical report on the progress made in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 55 / 188 of 20 December 2000 , to devote a separate section of the report to a global study on the illegal transfer of funds , especially funds derived from acts of corruption , and the impact of the illegal transfer of funds on economic , social and political progress , in particular in developing countries ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
Weaknesses in some national laws , regulations , licensing procedures and enforcement mechanisms are exacerbated by lack of capacity , insufficient political will , inconsistent approaches and inadequate coordination and cooperation at the national , bilateral , regional and global levels .  
It is anticipated that more countries will be able to follow this positive lead in confirming increased contributions to regular resources for 2001 and beyond , thereby enabling UNDP to build on and start to harvest the financial dividend of the renewed political support to UNDP , within the context of MYFF .  
That same political commitment to an enhanced regular resource base for UNDP is again reflected by the fact that a number of programme countries have pledged to the regular resource base of the organization , often despite considerable internal constraints . 
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
UNICEF expects that its efforts to refine and improve its long tradition of results-based management , including the reporting on results to its Executive Board and donors , combined with reinvigorated political will resulting from the special session of the General Assembly on Children to be held in 2001 , will soon bear fruit in terms of a more predictable and positive growth of regular resources income .  
Within the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council , and at major recent international conferences , Governments have acknowledged the significance of cooperatives as associations and enterprises through which citizens can effectively improve their lives while contributing to the economic , social , cultural and political advancement of their community and nation .  
In summary , we can say that the main provisions contained in the Constitution are the following : political pluralism , separation of and collaboration among the legislative , executive and judicial powers , the right of all citizens to protection and to develop and express their ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious identity .  
When the States adhered to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in 1996 , they pledged to respect and guarantee to all individuals living in their territory , and who are under their jurisdiction , the rights recognized by the Covenant with no discrimination based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , social status , birth , or any other criteria .  
Since the beginning of its existence as an independent nation , the Argentine Republic has demonstrated , through actions by the Government , the firm political determination to exercise its effective sovereignty in the southern territories and maritime areas inherited from Spain .  
This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
At the regional level , ECA and ESCAP , in collaboration with the UNAIDS secretariat , have held special events in support of the global initiative and in preparation for the special session of the General Assembly , with ECA having organized an African Development Forum at the highest political level focusing on Africas needs to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .  
The attitude of the Congolese people , as reflected by a wide range of civil society organizations , religious groups and opposition political parties whom the Council mission met in Kinshasa and elsewhere , suggests that the country is eager to move forward towards national reconciliation , democratization and development , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a climate of political plurality .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity . 
The committee meets with the Council when any change in the mandate is contemplated , in particular , the broadening or narrowing of scope of the mission , the introduction of new or additional functions or components , or a change in the authorization to use force ; the renewal of a mandate ; significant or serious political , military or humanitarian developments ; a rapid deterioration of the security situation on the ground ; the termination , withdrawal or scaling down in size of the operation , including the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict peace-building .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
However , persistent political tension along Guineas southern borders and the resultant prolonged presence of refugees , especially in the rural areas , have been putting tremendous pressure on its natural resources .  
In implementation of the instructions of the leaders of the GCC States framed with a view to promoting joint action to achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region and strengthen security and stability , the Ministerial Council reviewed the outcome of the meetings of the ministerial and technical committees and the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
In addition , under article 7 ( h ) , [ p ] ersecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law is also considered a crime against humanity .  
The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child guarantees the rights therein to every child and states further that [ e ] very child shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in this Charter irrespective of the childs or his / her parents or legal guardians race , ethnic group , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national and social origin , fortune , birth or other status ( art . 
Any approach to combating discrimination against non-citizens should take into account several critical factors including different categories of non-citizens ( e.g . permanent residents , temporary residents , undocumented aliens , etc . ) regarding different categories of rights ( e.g . political rights , civil rights , right to education , social security , other economic rights , etc . ) in countries of different levels of development and offering differing rationales for such distinctions ( e.g . issues of national reciprocity ) .  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
Specifically designed to ensure an inclusive approach , the JWG is composed of representatives of the three major Kosovo Albanian political parties , a Kosovo Serb member ( who withdrew following the initial session and was replaced on 13 April by another representative of the Kosovo Serb community ) , a Bosniac who represented Kosovos other minority communities , a representative of civil society and an independent expert , as well as seven international members , including an international chairman .  
Following an exhaustive search and interview procedure that won compliments from Kosovo political leaders for its transparency and the subsequent appointment of a new General Director of RTK and , the first tranche of funding from the European Agency for Reconstruction ( EAR ) for RTK was approved in March , and a tripartite agreement was signed among EAR , RTK and OSCE , which clarifies the responsibilities of each party for monitoring the performance and fiscal accountability of RTK .  
In view of the likelihood of a hot summer resulting from the criminal actions of extremist elements opposed to increased minority returns and the reconstruction of historic religious sites , my Special Representative is engaging intensively with political , religious and community leaders and police officials to seek a substantial improvement in their mutual cooperation as an essential element in improving police performance .  
The UNMIBH police commissioner project remains an essential institutional initiative for creating an apolitical police service , shielded from direct political interference from the ministries by functioning under a single chain of command led by an experienced police professional , designated Police Commissioner or Director of Police .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
There was a broad consensus that the most promising approach was to develop long-term and integrated strategies , combining a wide range of political , economic , social and other measures aimed at reducing or eradicating the underlying causes of conflict .  
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter that indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
Acknowledging that non-discriminatory legislation and protective laws create a supportive legal and political environment for the success of public health development and national HIV / AIDS prevention efforts , the Latvian Government revised and adopted an adequate legislative infrastructure .  
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
Noting with grave concern that Africa , in particular sub-Saharan Africa , is currently the worst affected region where HIV / AIDS is considered as a state of emergency , which threatens development , social cohesion , political stability , food security and life expectancy and imposes a devastating economic burden and that the dramatic situation on the continent needs urgent and exceptional national , regional and international action ;  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
However , it was also recognized that , apart from that statistical definition , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and socio-cultural circumstances .  
The mission , composed of representatives of the Department for Disarmament Affairs , the Department of Political Affairs and the UNDP Cambodia Office , visited Cambodia from 23 to 30 January 2001 and concluded that Cambodias fragile peace was indeed threatened by the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons , which not only destabilized the countrys delicate political balance , but also contributed to a dramatic increase in criminal activity and the attendant insecurity of the population . 
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We regret the existence of inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions in which intolerance and racial discrimination breed and fester , and we believe that genuine equality of opportunity for development is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
We also understand that discrimination contributes to inequitable political , economic , cultural and social conditions , and that genuine equality of opportunity [ for development ] is fundamental for the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We firmly believe that education , development and the faithful implementation of our international human rights norms / obligations , including enactment of laws and political , social and economic policies , are crucial to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
We reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Urges States to take the necessary measures to ensure that no person will be expelled , extradited or returned to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture or persecution on account of his or her [ race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ] racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic , or national origin [ or political affiliation ] ;  
Urges States to promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
To guarantee and promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
Urges States to acknowledge that the centuries-long slave trade , enslavement and other forms of servitude of Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples have resulted in substantial and lasting economic , political and cultural damage to these peoples and in the retardation of their institutions and societies , and that justice now requires that to alleviate the inequalities that still persist because of these shameful legacies , substantial national and international efforts be made .  
East Timor is a good example of the need for the international community to build on a successful peacekeeping intervention by laying the political , economic , judicial and constitutional foundations for lasting peace and security .  
Bearing in mind that corruption and the close social , economic and political links existing between employers of bonded labour and government officials at local level may be responsible for the perpetuation of this abhorrent practice ,  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
Since industrial environments such as shipping and ports undergo continuous technological , organizational and commercial change in a world which is changing continuously in respect of social and political structures , the evaluation and validation of courses - as well as the updating of instructors - must also be continuous .  Otherwise , an admirable system may end up teaching the wrong things !  
It also sought to secure the participation of organizations and institutions that are actively involved in the political , economic and social development of those Territories and of selected non-governmental organizations with long and established experience in island Territories .  
The representative of Venezuela stated that the points of view expressed during the Seminar provided an important reference for the Special Committee since they represented a key source of up-to-date knowledge and information that demonstrated the close relationship between the political , economic and social variables in every territory under consideration .  
The Special Committee therefore regards this regional seminar as a critical first step in this second International Decade , as we proceed to devise international strategies in a concerted effort to ensure that this sacred right to self-determination , this basic human right , is realized in all of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , so that the people might achieve their full political equality consistent with recognized international standards . 
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter that indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The obligation not to discriminate is an immediate duty and discrimination in access to food on the basis of race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status , as stated in article 2 , paragraph 2 , of the International Covenant , can not be justified under any circumstances , including low levels of resources .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
Clearly economic , social , cultural and hence nutritional situations tend to be extremely varied from one country to another and a model law would fail to address the problems experienced by people in their everyday lives and produce legislative solutions ill-adapted to legal and political systems in different countries .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The Special Representative calls for concerted efforts on the part of the National Election Committee , all political parties , non-governmental organizations , both local and international , and the international and donor communities , to guarantee that the commune elections are fair , transparent , and free from violence , and that sufficient and adequate voter information is properly disseminated .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
The current political process might seem slow , but the sensitive nature of the issues involved and the far-reaching implications for the countrys future made it vitally important that the National Convention proceed slowly and systematically in order to safeguard the interests of all the national races and to avoid replicating the shortcomings of the two previous Constitutions .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
The armed conflict in the north and the south-west , which forced most of the countrys development projects to a halt , and the unstable social and political situation prevailing in Ethiopia and Somalia have accelerated the deterioration of the Djiboutian economy .  
The previous report noted that the situation was worsening year by year , and described challenges in the area of sustainable human development resulting from the chronic instability of the countrys political , economic , social and security environment .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
Rather than using its political and moral authority to stir up hatred and violence , the Palestinian leadership must act , in accordance with its signed obligations , to halt all violence and terrorism directed against Israel , to end the relentless incitement in the media and by other authoritative figures and to restore an atmosphere of calm conducive to the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement .  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
The new Services will appropriately reflect the level of responsibilities of each of the Service chiefs , who act as the principal advisers to senior management within the Department and also support field operations on all technical and logistics support issues within their respective areas of responsibility for some 30 peacekeeping missions and independent political offices appointed by the Secretary-General .  
A number of interventions recalled article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986 , which stated that The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in , contribute to , and enjoy economic , social , cultural and political development , in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized .  
He argued that indigenous peoples were effectively colonized peoples in the economic , political and historic sense and suffered unfair and unequal economic arrangements typical of other colonized peoples .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Noting that in its resolution 52 / 111 of 12 December 1997 , in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , the General Assembly set as one of the main objectives of the Conference the review of the political , historical , social , cultural and other factors leading to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
Moreover , in the half-century that has elapsed since its establishment on the island of Taiwan , the Republic of China has seen significant political , economic and social development which renders it in practice an important member of the international community , as has been widely recognized at the global level .  
While the United Front has recently stated its commitment to a negotiated political settlement based on the right of the Afghan people to self-determination , a position supported by those Afghans supporting the convening of an emergency loya jirga , the Taliban remain of the view that the selection by ulemas of Mullah Mohammad Omar as Amir-ul Momenin with lifelong untrammelled powers has already adequately expressed the wishes of the Afghan people .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
I am convinced that a political solution based on the twin pillars of enabling the Afghan people to freely determine their own future and securing the legitimate national interests of Afghanistans neighbours through mutually binding commitments offers the best guarantee for a lasting peace in Afghanistan .  
On 31 July 2000 , the Government of Denmark reported that immigrants and refugees generally enjoyed legal equality with Danish citizens and , like all citizens , they were protected by law against discrimination on the basis of race , colour , religious belief , political observation , sexual orientation or national , social or ethnic origin .  
He recognized the interconnectedness of economics and politics and made a reference to the universally recognized understanding that all rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural , and the right to development are indivisible and interconnected .  
Since the 1990s , the society in Myanmar has been confronted by a slow and often painful pace of transition , with continuing unrest , political tensions , civil and political rights violations , a complex humanitarian situation and economic crisis .  
Stressing the need for the maintenance of regional and international peace and stability and friendly relations among all States , and underlining the overriding political , humanitarian and moral imperatives as well as the economic advantages of preventing the outbreak and escalation of conflicts ,  
To all the parties to the conflict , political parties and key sectors of civil society in the country : ( a ) that they commit themselves fully and in good faith to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue , avoiding pointless arguments and always keeping their eyes on the goal the establishment of a democratic , participatory system and full respect for civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
In particular , Parties have raised specific concerns regarding : ( i ) the competence of participants in the CST , ( ii ) the political nature of discussions within the CST , rather than a focus on scientific and technological issues , ( iii ) the lack of continuity of representatives to the CST , and ( iv ) inadequate time within the agenda of the CST to allow for in-depth analysis and debate of the issues .  
We must pledge today in a joint , coordinated and concerted way , and for the medium and long term as is expected of this Organization , to fulfil our moral , legal and political obligation to construct , for ourselves and for future generations , a legacy of democracy , freedom , peace and security .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has done important and indispensable work in recent years to build a consensus on the basic principle that terrorist acts , wherever and by whomever they are committed , are criminal and unjustifiable by any political , religious or philosophical considerations .  
In this regard , the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism , from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions .  On the national level , requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities , bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts .  
That phenomenon is terrorism , which requires the formulation of comprehensive international plans and approaches in the context of international legitimacy to confront international threats that do not discriminate on the basis of nationality , colour or creed , and which most certainly do not recognize any political , social , economic or geographical borders between States and peoples .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political , military , diplomatic , economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it . 
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
It is precisely for that reason , and as a consequence of the effective application of the principle of the indivisibility of international security , that we must at this painful time commit ourselves firmly to multilateralism , value it as the appropriate instrument for confronting any threats to global security and return with renewed and positive political will to the multilateral disarmament agenda .  
For more than 50 years now , we have struggled to find ways to achieve that measure of global political coherence required to survive the grave risks posed by weapons of mass destruction , thermonuclear bombs foremost among them , whose blasts are thousands of times more powerful than those of 11 September arsenals that could lead to human extinction .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
Through the efforts of UNOA and in particular of my Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa , as well as my Representative in Angola , broad contacts have been established with the Government , political parties , civil society , and the church which could provide a strong support base in the common search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict . 
Emphasizing also , as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme , that ecological crises facing humanity are deeply rooted in a complex web of political , economic , social , technological as well as inadequate societal attitudes , belief systems and perceptions ,  
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .  
He stated that SRRC was deeply committed to a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Somalia through dialogue and genuine reconciliation , which can enable all parties to reach a satisfactory political solution acceptable to all as outlined in the SRRCs Charter and Political Programme .  
One panellist considered that the success of European monetary integration had been favoured by the close trade ties among the countries involved and had been based on a unique and historically motivated political commitment by EU member States , which so far was still lacking in Asia , for example , and which in general was difficult to replicate elsewhere .  
The majority of those in academic circles who dealt with the issue of terrorism shared the opinion that terrorism meant the following : the use of or threat to use violence for political purposes ; a method of fighting or reaching specific goals based on intimidation of a society and government by causing human casualties and loss of property , characterized by ruthlessness and violation of moral and legal norms .  
Reaffirms that a strong political commitment by the international community is needed to implement strengthened and effective international cooperation and assistance for development , including social development , that the mobilization of domestic and international resources for development from all sources is an essential component of the implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action and of the further initiatives for social development ;  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
The radio will provide accurate , credible and impartial information about all aspects of the peace process , including military and political developments , the inter-Congolese dialogue and the many humanitarian assistance programmes operating in the country .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
The Security Coordinator also formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Secretariat on current and potential security-related problems , coordinates , plans and implements inter-agency security and safety programmes and acts as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation regarding security .  
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
In accordance with paragraph 2 of the resolution , our country is making steady and active efforts to prevent the use , in violation of decisions made by the relevant United Nations organs , of unilateral measures of economic and political coercion inconsistent with the norms of international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations as a means of applying pressure on independent developing States .  
The adoption of laws encouraging the use of unilateral coercive economic measures in order to achieve political objectives constitutes a flagrant violation of the rules of international law , particularly the principles , objectives and rules governing trade among nations .  
The use of coercive measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , whether unilaterally or under the auspices of regional and international organizations , poses a genuine threat to international peace and security and is in manifest violation of human rights principles .  
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
Despite the indivisible nature of Euro-Mediterranean security and despite the promises of partnership that have been reiterated on many occasions , the Mediterranean , as a recent declaration of the European Parliament declared , has become a zone that is a microcosm of the principal contradictions of the twenty-first century and is likely to produce irreversible demographic , economic , political and cultural divisions .  
At the crossroads of three continents , the Mediterranean is in a state of constant tension and must cope with major political , economic , ecological and demographic challenges , let alone a host of global social scourges that affect this region .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
Bridges should be built in the political , economic , financial , commercial , technical and social realm , and institutions should be strengthened at all levels , to facilitate such integration in a just and equitable process .  
It is time that the necessary political will is displayed by those countries whose ambiguous positions have led the Conference on Disarmament to its current comatose state , so that the Conference can be activated to fulfil its intended role as the single multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
The establishment of an effective , functioning government administration was fundamental to the comprehensive mandate given to UNTAET under Security Council resolution 1272 ( 1999 ) , and is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
It also welcomed the decision of the special session to intensify political commitment to close the gender gap in primary and secondary education by 2005 and to ensure free , compulsory and universal primary education for both boys and girls by 2015 .  
At the same time , many delegates stressed that democracy was inconceivable without human rights and , in particular , the rights of women , children and minorities , and that it requires the gradual expansion of political space in order to guarantee the full exercise of the political , economic , social and cultural rights of all .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
The two aforementioned international forums , the Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the Community of Democracies which will have its second major conference at Seoul in 2002 , play an important role in mobilizing the political will for advancing democratic values , principles and practices and ensuring that the lessons learned from democratization processes in various parts of the world will not be lost by future generations .  
In addition to the loss of life and physical damage , international terrorism led to political instability , which was inimical to harmonious development of States , and made it necessary to devote huge human and financial resources to combating that scourge and eliminating its consequences .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
Equally aware of the fact that older women , in all regions of the world , represent an important human resource , and that their contribution to society and development in the economic , cultural , political and social fields often remains unseen or unrecognized ,  
The General Assemblys political decision on the level of the regular budget was often arbitrary and sometimes appeared to be motivated by budgetary and economic trends in national Governments or by what Member States contributed to other United Nations operations or entities .  
Nevertheless , the United States and the United Kingdom , with logistic support provided by Turkey and with both logistic support and funding provided by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , are persisting undeterred in their contempt for the Charter of the United Nations and international law and are engaging in this cowardly terrorist aggression against Iraqi civilians and against Iraqs sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence .  
The sides have stated that an essential precondition for the transfer of the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan to the political channel is the unconditional fulfilment of the demands of the anti-terrorist coalition , including the handing-over of those who inspired and organized the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 in New York and Washington , D.C . , the abolition of the rule of the Taliban , who have provided shelter for terrorist and extremist groups on the territory they control , and the disbandment and complete disarmament of their armed units . 
The sides have expressed their strong conviction that the political process must be aimed at creating a widely representative government , including the representatives of all the peoples and ethnic groups concerned , to be formed as a result of the free expression of their will . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance , if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that persons race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that persons position for any of these reasons .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .  
Demographic trends , such as ageing and urbanization , were affecting the social , economic and political functioning of almost all countries , and the interrelations between international migration and development were numerous and complex .  
They included the widening economic gap between countries of the South and countries of the North ; the existence in the countries of the North of a labour market capable of absorbing labour from countries of the South in specialized areas of technology ; the economic recession in developing countries ; increasing unemployment and inflation ; and the expansion of political conflicts , including in Africa , that increased insecurity and poverty .  
For this reason , we are not bound by such wording and concepts contained in that document which , therefore , shall not entail any political or legal consequences and do not oblige us to take any preventive , legislative , judicial , administrative , regulatory or other measures at the national level .  
Recognizing that the right of human beings to live free from fear and poverty can not be realized unless , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international human rights instruments , conditions are created enabling all human beings to enjoy to the full their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ,  
Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Reaffirming that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are mutually supportive concepts : democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural regime and their full participation in all aspects of life . 
Within the United Nations Development Assistance Framework , the programme contributes to broader national efforts to reduce geographical disparities in major social indicators ; introduce reforms designed to improve the quality and responsiveness of health and education services ; and create and sustain public and political concern for childrens and womens rights .  
The Secretary-General , in his report prepared in June 2000 ( A / 54 / 918-S / 2000 / 581 ) , had noted that 20 years after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and after billions of dollars had been expended to feed successive war efforts , Afghanistan remained in a state of acute crisis , with its resources depleted , its intelligentsia in exile , its people disenfranchised , its traditional political structures shattered and its human development indices among the lowest in the world .  
There is a widely shared expectation that the United Nations can play a vital role in facilitating a transition from war to peace and in enabling the Afghan people to involve themselves actively in an inclusive participatory process through which a comprehensive political plan could be devised and implemented .  
It is imperative that the Afghan people be central to the political plan , and that their human rights , long denied to them , and their legitimate expectation to live in freedom and with dignity in a society where peace is restored and the rule of law protects their lives and their livelihoods against violence and the depredations of powerful warlords , be realized .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Unlike the industrial age , which had been structured around vertically integrated organizations with high costs of communications , information and transportation , the age of networking was structured around horizontal networks , with each organization focusing on competitive niches in order to obtain maximum political economic and financial advantage by making the right decisions at the right time . 
With regard to the possible appointment of an independent expert on the issue of impunity , the Commission stated that , as impunity is a complex topic , impunity for violations of civil and political rights and for violations of economic and social rights give rise to different problems and should be treated separately . 
It could also include development of codes of conduct or ethics , an effective and impartial civil service , effective systems for financing political parties , establishment of independent oversight bodies , free and transparent media , transparent public procurement rules , effective regulation of financial systems , an independent judiciary and the effective implementation of the rule of law .  
Her delegation remained committed to participation in the special session at the highest political level , and to childrens participation in the planned local , national and international events , which would enhance the visibility of the session .  
In the present situation , the European Union calls on both parties to do their utmost , on the political , security , economic and social fronts , to return to the path of negotiation without prior conditions and with the objective of satisfying the legitimate expectations of the peoples in the region as expressed at the Madrid Conference in 1991 :  
Welcomes the convening of the donor meetings for East Timor at Tokyo in December 1999 , at Lisbon in June 2000 , at Brussels in December 2000 , at Canberra in June 2001 and at Oslo in December 2001 , which focused on the national budget and the transition towards independence in East Timor in four key areas : political , public administration , public finances , and economic and social reconstruction , and urges the international community to fulfil its pledges to meet the external requirements for rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities for East Timor ;  
Acknowledges that the establishment of an effective and functioning governmental administration is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment in East Timor , and in this regard urges the international community to continue to support efforts aimed at institution-building and training of civil servants , in particular in the areas of public finances , the judiciary , senior management and the development and maintenance of the central administrative systems of government ;  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Welcoming the efforts of the transitional Government of Somalia to promote national reconciliation within Somalia , recognizing that progress has been achieved in some regions in re-establishing economic and administrative stability , and urging the Transitional National Government , political and traditional leaders and factions to make every effort to complete , without preconditions , the peace and reconciliation process through dialogue and involvement of all parties in a spirit of mutual accommodation and tolerance ,  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
A key role for the international community was to support a Somali peace process , the establishment of the rule of law and the emergence of impartial national political and judicial institutions in Somalia ; and that Somalia would need help to rebuild its administrative and physical infrastructure .  
Among the recommendations of the Secretary-General was the strengthening of the mandate of BONUCA in order to enhance its effectiveness and the visibility of its activities by increasing its resource capabilities , strengthening its administrative capacities and making available to the Office a level of resources commensurate with its revised mandate , namely , bringing about political dialogue and national reconciliation , monitoring the security situation , ensuring respect for and the promotion of human rights ; and providing political support for the mobilization of resources with a view to the economic reconstruction of the country .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Our peoples wish to see the Commonwealth as an area of stability , security , and harmony among nations , a region of stable political , economic , social and scientific and technical development that occupies a fitting place in the international community .  
In Central America we have made great progress , not only in the process of transition involving painstaking work in the area of pacifying , disarming and reintegrating armed groups into civil life , as well as campaigns to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence and integration into political , social and cultural life but also in creating awareness among our peoples about the need to develop a culture of peace , which is closely related to the promotion of civic and democratic values .  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , the needs of local indigenous communities , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Believe that the strengthening of democratic institutions throughout the Latin American and Caribbean region , the advances made in peace processes in some countries of the region and greater public awareness have helped to incorporate the environmental dimension into the development process and to make people-centred sustainable development the first priority of the political , economic and social programmes of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Welcoming the New Partnership for Africas Development , which embodies a common African vision of the future and a shared conviction of the pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to place African countries , both individually and collectively , on a path of robust growth and sustainable development , thereby fully integrating Africa into the global economy and political system ,  
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , the needs of local indigenous communities , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
The Convening Group of the Community of Democracies particular note of the observation of the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 33 of his report ( A / 56 / 499 ) on the issue that two international forums namely , the Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the Community of Democracies play an important role in mobilizing the political will for advancing democratic values , principles and practices and ensuring that the lessons learned from democratization processes in various parts of the world will not be lost by future generations .  
Because of the expansion and the increase in travel within the Mission area it also planned to replace obsolete or faulty mobile phone sets provided to political and civil affairs units , and , therefore , the electronic voice mail system known as CarLog is requested in 2002 .  
Consequently , the entire range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , are relevant to intellectual property systems .  
Fourth , because the Commission can not possibly , for political and / or practical reasons , shed light on all countries in which there are severe and consistent patterns of human rights abuse , the Sub-Commission has used country-specific resolutions and statements by the Chairperson to help identify and put pressure on those countries which may not have received adequate attention in other human rights bodies .  
To implement the strategy , a series of integrated , systemic and phased programme inputs in the political , social and economic spheres are envisaged and interlinked to reinforce each other and to help the Government to achieve three core objectives : accountable and transparent governance within the context of a broad-based participatory political framework ; political and social stability that rests on equity and respect of human rights ; and broad-based economic prosperity .  
The tremendous qualitative difference from traditional forms of advertising is that no nations or individuals can refuse to be exposed to space advertising , which might be considered undesirable for scientific , aesthetic , political , or even religious reasons .  
This political will is reflected in the project for the creation of an Algerian Space Agency , which should help the country to strengthen its national capacities in economic and social development , knowledge of natural resources , environmental protection and the prevention and / or management of major disasters .  
Even without being exhaustive , these are basically the major areas in which international support is deemed to be crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment in East Timor . We would like to seize this opportunity to thank all delegations that contributed to this draft resolution with comments and inputs .  
Since environmental protection was a broad and complex issue with political , economic and social dimensions , the effective implementation of Agenda 21 required a considerable amount of resources , and its management required a multifaceted approach that balanced economic , social and environmental considerations and took into account the regional and international impact of the actions taken .  
Under Expected accomplishments , replace paragraph ( e ) with the following text : improved access by Governments and international bodies to analytical tools , options and adequate methodologies regarding the linkages between political and economic issues and policies , such as economic sanctions , imposition of coercive economic measures , the relationship between disarmament and development and relevant aspects of post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction .  
His approach to human rights is global and comprehensive , thus including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; he intends to pay serious attention to poverty as a fundamental human rights issue ;  
Monitor the observation , collection and analysis of legal , institutional , political , economic , social and cultural information by drawing on the skills of treaty bodies and national institutions for regulation and mediation ;  
At the systematic policy of the Government of Myanmar of persecuting the democratic opposition , National League for Democracy members and their families , as well as ethnic opposition parties , and at the use by the Government of intimidatory methods such as arbitrary arrest and detention , abuse of the legal system , including harsh long-term prison sentences , which has forced many to refrain from exercising their legitimate political rights ;  
The continuing violations of the human rights of women , in particular forced labour , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation , often committed by military personnel , and especially directed towards women who are returning refugees , internally displaced or belong to ethnic minorities or the political opposition ;  
The severe restrictions on the freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , the restrictions on citizens access to information , including censorship controls on all forms of domestic media and many international publications , and the restrictions imposed on citizens wishing to travel within the country and abroad , including the denial of passports on political grounds , and gross interference in private life , family , home or correspondence ; 5 .  Calls upon the Government of Myanmar :
