On 18 May , at a report meeting on " three stresses " and " review and reexamination " among leading bodies at the municipal level , Jia Qinglin , member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , required that party organizations at all levels of the municipality implement the " three represents " requirement set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin in their firm and correct implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies and in the strict enforcement of party discipline .  
Zhang Lichang , secretary of the municipal party committee , said that leading cadres at all levels must stand at the high plain of historical development to fully understand the urgency of implementing the important concept of " three represents " in close connection with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and with the actual conditions of Tianjin 's work , further emancipate people 's minds , further break new ground and make new progress , grasp opportunities , and develop by leaps and bounds .

To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
Sometimes , members of the party leading groups in the municipal people 's congress standing committee , the municipal government , and the CPPCC municipal committee , as well as comrades in relevant departments , are also invited to the meeting so that the collective decision made by the standing committee may give full consideration to the needs of all quarters concerned .  The fourth category is " implementation " .  After a decision is made by the standing committee , responsibilities are also made explicit .  
Standing committee members will take action to organize its implementation within the scope of their responsibilities .  The municipal party committee will supervise and inspect the implementation , and will coordinate and solve problems at a good time .  Thus , persistently integrating collective leadership with individual responsibility through the division of work plays a positive role in ensuring that the municipal party committee can effectively control the overall situation and coordinate the work of all quarters concerned when handling all major affairs of the whole city and acting as the core of leadership .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .

This guaranteed that the decisions and arrangements made by the municipal party committee more relevant and pertinent in giving guidance to the concrete work .

However , before deciding on the matter , the standing committees concerned should solicit views from the members of the party committees concerned .  
The municipal party committee explicitly requires : All major affairs in the capital city 's political , economic , cultural , and social life must be submitted to the Political Consultation Conference for deliberation .  In particular , before decisions are made on major projects and policies , before the change of administrative division of districts in the municipality , and before the formulation of local laws and regulations , political consultation must be conducted .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .

he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .

In the past three financial years as well as the current one ( four financial years ) , the total expenditure of the Government , the former provisional municipal councils and the Housing Authority on public works is about $ 188 billion , i.e . $ 47 billion per year on average .

The length of time required for the 14 major development projects varies according to their nature .

Going south along Hsin Sheng South Road past Hsin Yi Road , you pass the Chin Hua Girls ' Senior High and Taipei Mosque on the right , and on the left stretches the zone designated for the No . 7 municipal park .

In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere .

With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
One could argue that a municipal tribunal could be more sensitive to individual cases and more responsive to the needs of the local community because it is likely to be situated in , or close to , the site where alleged violations were perpetrated .  
Promotion of access to land and security of tenure for all urban residents , in particular the poor , through improved land market transparency and innovative mechanisms to utilize public and private land , including fiscal incentives to bring unutilized land into use , improved land-delivery and land-tenure systems and , where appropriate , direct government and municipal landownership ;  
Strengthening of the role of land as the cornerstone of urban municipal finance , including measures for more effective taxation of the value added on privately owned land resulting from public infrastructure investments , as well as adoption of land and property taxes designed to encourage more economical use of land and discourage speculative withholding of land suitable for development ;  
Today I am happy to be able to tell the international community that my country completed instituting its democratic republican institutions in June this year when we organized our multiparty legislative and municipal elections .  
It is to wonder how the scales of justice can operate and extend their influence when not backed up by a powerful sword if I may transpose into the international sphere the familiar thought patterns of the municipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy so dear to Montesquieu of legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
In reply to concerns raised by the Committee relating to the real force of this provision , the representative stated that , effectively , the Constitution of Peru provided that international treaties concluded by Peru formed part of municipal law , and , accordingly , article 2 , which established that everybody is equal and can not be discriminated against by reason of sex , was part of the law of the land .  
The following major levels of planning and management need to be distinguished : global , regional , national , provincial or district , local , municipal or village , and household or farm .  
Although the Marriage Act had been designed to ensure equal treatment for men and women , in reality , women sometimes found themselves in difficult financial circumstances after a divorce ; that eventuality was however covered by the social security system , and if necessary it was also possible to obtain a living allowance from the municipal authority .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
The urban poor are the primary victims of municipal sewage discharged into water bodies and the improper disposal of solid waste and toxic chemicals .  
Modification of the " first-past-the-post " system for municipal councils has yet to be addressed by the presidential commission and the political parties , but the expectation is that it will be included , together with the identity document and residential voting , in any package of reforms that may be considered by the Legislative Assembly in the coming months .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
They should be seen not as omnipotent decision makers and providers , as in the traditional management model , but rather as the focal point of a system that will work more effectively if it is expanded through cooperation with outside organizations and if its efficiency is enhanced through decentralization , giving more power to regional and municipal decision makers .

this fund is closely connected with several of the previous bureau directors .  Because of the seriousness of the charges made against Lin , and because of how widespread are the official and issues involved , with such a complicated background , the working group made up of officials from the Guangdong provincial Office of Discipline and Inspection and the censorate , with Beijing in agreement , undertook this sudden raid to arrest Lin Hui without notifying the Guangzhou municipal government .  
The meeting was chaired by Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan , who is also chairman of the preparatory committee .

The special police contingent of the criminal police corps of the Beijing municipal public security bureau is a specialized force formed in view of Beijing 's development into an international metropolis .  
It has been learned that except for central organs and the State Council , the leading bodies of all local provincial and municipal governments across the country have already completed the session-changing process without a hitch prior to the convocation of the " two sessions . "  In the future , barring special reasons or work needs , all ministerial-level cadres will have to leave office once they reach the age limit of 65 .  
Li Peng urged the Beijing municipal party committee and municipal government to tighten their leadership over Beijing 's community services , organized knowledgeable and educated cadres to work in various communities to develop their services and improve their operations so that these communities will play an even bigger part in ensuring social stability and improving the people 's living conditions .  
The General Office of the Ministry of Education the other day issued a circular among various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal education departments , in which it discussed an explosion incident , which broke out in a teaching building of a primary school in Jiangxi a week ago , and urged education departments in all areas as well as all types of schools at all levels to immediately take action to introduce a security and prevention system in schools so as to create favorable conditions for guaranteeing young people 's healthy growth .  
he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .  Furthermore , he provided concrete requests and suggestions for the next steps in the rescue work , helping the injured , cracking the case , and protecting social stability .  
The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government have extensively mobilized people in various circles to take a positive part in maintaining public order , and judicial , procuratorial , and public security organs have scrupulously performed their duties in protecting the environment of public security , thus ensuring political and social stability in the capital .  
Nevertheless , he said that due to the joint efforts of the Hong Kong Arts Development Council and the two municipal councils , Hong Kong does have , through the organisation of recreational and cultural exchanges and other activities , a sound base for gradually nurturing the public 's understanding of national history and culture and for building a greater sense of national identity .  
( a ) The relevant government departments are at the preliminary stage of drawing up the schedule of accommodation and conceptual layout for the planned municipal and social service facilities within the Government / Institution / Community ( G / IC ) sites in the West Kowloon Reclamation which include an Indoor Recreation Centre , a multi-storey carpark , a complex incorporating a home for the aged , a care and attention home , a family service centre and other uses . 
He together with 19 Hong Kong based officers are tasked to build a very crucial bridge to link up the CPG and the provincial / municipal authorities in the Mainland with the HKSARG . I sincerely look forward to the generous support of the central leadership , State and Provincial officials to this new Office , to help it establish its work on a sound foundation . 
On the part of the municipal services department , efforts would be made to ensure water in public and private swimming pools had been properly treated to meet the disinfection standard for the prevention of communicable diseases .  
The Administration has implemented the Senior Citizen Card Scheme ( SCC Scheme ) to foster respect for the elderly by encouraging the private and public sectors to provide price concessions or priority services for senior citizens .  We are delighted to note that franchised bus operators and the two provisional municipal councils have also joined in to promote respect for the elderly .  
We have learnt from the representatives of Guangdong and Shenzhen that the authorities concerned both at the provincial and municipal levels attach great importance to the issue .  They have stepped up the coordination of control point operation and have actively implemented a series of improvement measures such as enhancing human resources management and manpower deployment at the control points , acquiring new computer equipment and installing automatic electronic licence identification system etc .  Besides , an emergency coordination unit has also been set up at the Huanggang Control Point to promptly handle emergencies there .  
Taking into account the impending restructuring of the two municipal services departments and the need to ensure continued normal operations and services to the public when the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department are set up on January 1 , 2000 , the Government has decided to continue employing those with an operational need for a period so that the two new departments can make arrangements according to actual requirements .  
In the past three financial years as well as the current one ( four financial years ) , the total expenditure of the Government , the former provisional municipal councils and the Housing Authority on public works is about $ 188 billion , i.e . $ 47 billion per year on average .  
What is more , manned emergency 24-hour telephone hotlines will be set up during amber warning rainstorm or above , together with essential standby plant and labour , so that blockages to river flow due to accumulated debris / municipal wastes can be dealt with and cleared at the earliest possible time .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
The length of time required for the 14 major development projects varies according to their nature . For example , China Steel 's third expansion project can be completed this year , yet only about five kilometers a year can be completed of the Taipei municipal rapid transit system , which will reach 100 kilometers in length , while the urban waste disposal project is an ongoing one .  
Going south along Hsin Sheng South Road past Hsin Yi Road , you pass the Chin Hua Girls ' Senior High and Taipei Mosque on the right , and on the left stretches the zone designated for the No . 7 municipal park . Here stands a row of car repair garages which , once they close down after dark , turn into a deserted oasis of darkness long familiar to Taipei residents .  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
One could argue that a municipal tribunal could be more sensitive to individual cases and more responsive to the needs of the local community because it is likely to be situated in , or close to , the site where alleged violations were perpetrated .  
Promotion of access to land and security of tenure for all urban residents , in particular the poor , through improved land market transparency and innovative mechanisms to utilize public and private land , including fiscal incentives to bring unutilized land into use , improved land-delivery and land-tenure systems and , where appropriate , direct government and municipal landownership ;  
Strengthening of the role of land as the cornerstone of urban municipal finance , including measures for more effective taxation of the value added on privately owned land resulting from public infrastructure investments , as well as adoption of land and property taxes designed to encourage more economical use of land and discourage speculative withholding of land suitable for development ;  
Today I am happy to be able to tell the international community that my country completed instituting its democratic republican institutions in June this year when we organized our multiparty legislative and municipal elections .  
It is to wonder how the scales of justice can operate and extend their influence when not backed up by a powerful sword if I may transpose into the international sphere the familiar thought patterns of the municipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy so dear to Montesquieu of legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
In reply to concerns raised by the Committee relating to the real force of this provision , the representative stated that , effectively , the Constitution of Peru provided that international treaties concluded by Peru formed part of municipal law , and , accordingly , article 2 , which established that everybody is equal and can not be discriminated against by reason of sex , was part of the law of the land .  
The following major levels of planning and management need to be distinguished : global , regional , national , provincial or district , local , municipal or village , and household or farm .  
Although the Marriage Act had been designed to ensure equal treatment for men and women , in reality , women sometimes found themselves in difficult financial circumstances after a divorce ; that eventuality was however covered by the social security system , and if necessary it was also possible to obtain a living allowance from the municipal authority .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
The urban poor are the primary victims of municipal sewage discharged into water bodies and the improper disposal of solid waste and toxic chemicals .  
Modification of the " first-past-the-post " system for municipal councils has yet to be addressed by the presidential commission and the political parties , but the expectation is that it will be included , together with the identity document and residential voting , in any package of reforms that may be considered by the Legislative Assembly in the coming months .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
They should be seen not as omnipotent decision makers and providers , as in the traditional management model , but rather as the focal point of a system that will work more effectively if it is expanded through cooperation with outside organizations and if its efficiency is enhanced through decentralization , giving more power to regional and municipal decision makers .

The United Nations Mission in Haiti ( UNMIH ) has done a commendable job in assisting the Haitian authorities in sustaining a secure and stable environment , in organizing successful municipal and legislative elections and , above all , in managing the smooth transition from one democratically elected president to another no mean feat , given the tortured political history of Haiti .

In its concluding observations on the report of Finland , the Committee expressed concern at the absence of an integrated monitoring mechanism capable , inter alia , of supervising the effectiveness of decentralized and sometimes privatized social ( health , education and social care ) municipal policies and services for the most vulnerable groups of society , including minority children .  
Both major parties in the Government had made unequivocal statements that the coming national and municipal elections in 1998 would be free and fair , and had asked the armed forces and members of the electoral commission to remain neutral . 
The implementation of those recommendations , which included the creation of a national civil register responsible for issuing a single identity and voter card , the introduction of residential voting , and the introduction of proportional representation in the municipal councils , would constitute a significant advance in El Salvador 's electoral system .

Efforts to experiment with introducing new forms of democratic process to provide people with a choice of their elected representatives at the municipal or local level in certain countries deserve our notice and appreciation , if we are sincere about recognizing different historical traditions in the evolution of democratic political practice .  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
In some cities in Europe , campaigns to encourage communities to separate waste at the household level have been so successful that there is insufficient capacity to recycle all the waste collected by municipal authorities and , because of increased supply , the market price for recycled materials has dropped drastically .  
To ensure success , however , it is imperative to immediately provide employment opportunities and to generate incomes for the local population ; this will require focused action over a medium _ term period to relieve the population through communal and municipal local infrastructure works , food _ for _ work initiatives ( particularly for rural infrastructure development ) , integration of rural women into the local economy through training and related support for small _ scale economic activities , provision of ample micro _ and small _ scale credit at the individual and enterprise levels etc .

However , monitoring is basically carried out by governmental and non-governmental bodies which reflect the various interests of the community , given the close and multifaceted links between the institution in question , the President of the People 's Council and the district delegates to the municipal assemblies , who are popular leaders , elected by direct secret ballot ; all of these act as mechanisms for participatory democracy in the community where the institution is located .  
However , backed by international legal experts , including the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe , the President refused to accept the Court 's ruling and insisted on parliamentary elections , to be held in mid _ October 1997 .  15 .

This is a notion that has been deeply ingrained in the conceptual development , positive normativity and consistent jurisprudence of both municipal and international law since Roman Law was at its zenith more than five centuries ago , when modern European colonization began .  
Forms of participation by resident non-citizens should also be developed , including local voting rights after a certain period of residence and inclusion of elected non-citizen observers in municipal , regional and national legislative and decision-making assemblies ;

In fact , since 1991 , my country has been steadfastly undertaking an irreversible process of democratization that has led to several rounds of municipal , legislative and presidential elections under conditions recognized by international observers as being calm and unbiased .
