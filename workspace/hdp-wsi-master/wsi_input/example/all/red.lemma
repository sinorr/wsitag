Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
The tiles of the emperor 's palace in Peking shone " like gold " under the sun . The Bao En Temple in Nanking was particularly impressive , being constructed from a number of attractive buildings in the center of which was a porcelain pagoda of nine storeys , roofed with yellow and red tiles with hints of green . At its eaves were bells which rang continuously in the breeze .  
When mainland China 's band of political fraudsters raised high the red banner of " total dictatorship , " the minds of countless intellectuals groaned in the most abject despair in the dark corners of the " cowsheds " and prisons .  
In the late 1940s , the then bustling and cosmopolitan Shanghai rejoiced at having survived World War II relatively unscathed .

Seed boxes recreate the natural environment with artificial day and night and corresponding temperature changes , after which " winter " arrives , and the seeds are stored at low temperatures .

Grabbing the bird , I discovered that the webbing of her foot had been pierced by a hook caught in a rope used by the local aquaculturists . The swan 's blood was turning the water around her red . I quickly tried to pull out the fish hook with my hands , but the hook was too deeply caught in the flesh , and I ended up cutting my own index finger instead . All the while , the injured bird was splashing and struggling to fly away , drenching us with lake water .

Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
" Turning a corner , the bus had climbed to the height of the temperate forest . There was no longer the rustling of bamboo leaves ; through the windows came the sound of soughing pines , and both sides of the road were dark with Japanese red cedar , Taiwan red pine and Pinus morrisonicola .

The artificially cultivated rhododendrons in the cities come in shades ranging from deep to pale and in hues from purple or brick red to pink or white , like a jumbled rainbow .  
The higher the elevation , the later the flowers bloom , and spring flowering species are also followed by summer flowering ones . On the 18th day of the 9th lunar month , in a cold dark forest where all the spring birds had fallen silent , Mei Yao-chen ( 1002-1060 ) of the Northern Song dynasty was delighted to chance upon rhododendron flowers with a color more splendid than the red of a dawn sky .

He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
The Amita Sutra also notes that the Kingdom of Paradise contains the Seven Treasure Pond which brims over with the Water of Eight Deeds and Virtues , and the bottom of the pond is covered with gold dust . . . .

As for the Taiwan red cypress-merihi in Japanese-it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress . But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees . The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .

After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .

Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
The tiles of the emperor 's palace in Peking shone " like gold " under the sun . The Bao En Temple in Nanking was particularly impressive , being constructed from a number of attractive buildings in the center of which was a porcelain pagoda of nine storeys , roofed with yellow and red tiles with hints of green . At its eaves were bells which rang continuously in the breeze .  
When mainland China 's band of political fraudsters raised high the red banner of " total dictatorship , " the minds of countless intellectuals groaned in the most abject despair in the dark corners of the " cowsheds " and prisons .  
In the late 1940s , the then bustling and cosmopolitan Shanghai rejoiced at having survived World War II relatively unscathed .

Seed boxes recreate the natural environment with artificial day and night and corresponding temperature changes , after which " winter " arrives , and the seeds are stored at low temperatures . The process can not be hurried , and it demands far more patience of the silviculturists than propagating the Taiwan red cypress or Taiwan cypress , whose seeds ' dormancy can be broken in a week or two given adequate water and light .  
Grabbing the bird , I discovered that the webbing of her foot had been pierced by a hook caught in a rope used by the local aquaculturists . The swan 's blood was turning the water around her red .

He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
The Amita Sutra also notes that the Kingdom of Paradise contains the Seven Treasure Pond which brims over with the Water of Eight Deeds and Virtues , and the bottom of the pond is covered with gold dust . . . .

These unfamiliar strangers from the distant past left everyone speechless . Day and night , the archeologists dug feverishly for more ancient relics . About a month after the discovery of pit # 1 , another brick worker came running with the news that he had dug up two more heads some 30 meters away . He remarked , " The eyebrows are blue , and the lips are red . "  
The bushy eyebrows are " dyed " a deep green , the large eyes are accented with a deep-blue eye shadow , the lips are painted red , and the ears are pierced .

The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
At the door between the living room and dining room , there 's a tall ceramic cylinder suitable for storing scrolls , with a design that features the bright red canna blossom-a common sight in the countryside-around which bees are buzzing . Above are the words : " Busy Bees at Work . " The hardworking artist himself , who spends all day at his labors , is perhaps not unlike those bees .  
For instance , nowadays when one sees a Chinese-style roof with upswept eaves , the red beam high up in the middle is actually made from a tube of compressed paper . The light , cheap paper tube is wrapped in a layer of gauze and covered in red paint . Unless you actually tapped it , you would n't know it was paper .  
In design terms , to attract young people Peter Sung is tending even more to abandon ornate palace-style accessories in favor of bright , fresh white walls and red gingham tablecloths , along with movable screens carved with Chinese characters , and chairs made from black steel tubing in a Ming-dynasty style , to create a Chinese style with a young and modern feel .  
Inside the main door is a Guan Gong statue niche decorated with embroidered cloth . In front is an altar for offerings , and votive items are lined up on it .

As for the Taiwan red cypress-merihi in Japanese-it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress . But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees . The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .

The only thing they can do is control their weight by eating the proper foods . The hospital invented a game to teach children how to identify healthy snacks . Low-nutrition , high-calorie goodies such as cakes , chocolates , potato chips , and french fries are assigned a red light , indicating that they should not be eaten too often .

Theoretically , a rice wine unadulterated by ethanol should be more aromatic and tasty . But people still preferred the original formula . After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .

Or he may paint freely with mysterious black or melancholy blue yet harbor a growing zest for life in his heart . "  
The folk totems in the painstakingly executed works of potter Li Hsing-lung rearrange traditional linear patterns , transforming them into symbols , resulting in entirely new creations uniquely representative of the culture from which they sprang .

Leading the goddess Mazu are her chief bodyguards , Qianliyan ( Thousand-Mile Eyes ) on the left and Shunfeng'er ( Fair-Wind Ears ) on the right . Legend says that these two have tremendous paranormal powers ; Qianliyan , as his name suggests , can see a thousand miles in any direction , while Shunfeng'er can hear anything , no matter where it may happen . But at traffic intersections in our mortal world , even these two must wait patiently at red lights , while passersby take their chance to bask in the gods ' awesome presence .
