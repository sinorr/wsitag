The Taiwan independent forces have attempted to use the two-Korea model to solve the cross-strait relations .

In his " inaugural speech , " in order to leave a good impression , the new Taiwan leader used ambiguous and beautiful words to describe his viewpoints on the history , the nation , the state , and sovereignty .

While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .

For the purposes of the High Commissioner 's preliminary report , all participating national focal points , international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , specialized agencies and programmes , and interested others , shall be requested to provide relevant information to the High Commissioner , based upon their own independent assessments and activities .  
For purposes of the High Commissioner 's report , all participating national focal points , international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , specialized agencies and programmes , and interested others , shall be requested to provide relevant information to the High Commissioner , based upon their own independent assessments and activities .  
PASHAYEV ( Azerbaijan ) said that drug abuse , illegal drug trafficking and crime were increasing at alarming rates and had serious political , economic and social implications for countries , particularly the newly independent States , which had been confronted with problems resulting from aggression , large numbers of refugees and displaced persons , economies in transition and a geographical situation favourable to drug dealers .  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
The Commission decided to set up a working group composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the international instruments adopted by the States concerned .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
Moreover , pursuant to article 6 [ 27 ] of this Act , any clause of any contract , regulation or statute that is contrary to the principle of equal treatment of men and women in respect of access to employment , advancement , vocational guidance , training , refresher courses and retraining , or access to an independent profession and conditions of work shall automatically be invalid . 
They also have been asked by many States engaged in democratization to help encourage and facilitate the active participation of citizens in political processes , and to foster the emergence of a productive civil society , including responsible and independent communications media .  
NULLNonetheless , during that time the United Nations was active in keeping international organization alive , in promoting and facilitating decolonization , in easing the transition of newly independent peoples into the international State system , in promoting economic and social development , in building human rights machinery and in defending international law . 
The logic of the Charter is today made manifest as United Nations support for democratization helps to prevent aggression and to foster the construction and maintenance of viable and independent States as the basic guarantors of human rights , the basic mechanisms for solving national problems and the basic elements of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
She emphasized that UNEP must emerge as an independent , objective and authoritative organization , equipped and empowered to champion global environmental issues , lead the United Nations in a concerted attack on the worst aspects of global environmental degradation , and develop , monitor and perhaps even enforce international environmental law .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
In an exciting new development , the International Federation , non-governmental organizations , church agencies and the ICRC which between them are the end-point deliverers of some 95 per cent of international humanitarian assistance have come together to develop a second-generation code which will lay down minimal performance criteria for independent agencies and will define , for the first time , both a universal best practice for agencies and the quantity and quality of assistance disaster victims have a right to expect from assistance agencies . 
Today , as we celebrate the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People , my delegation would like to express to the Chairman and members of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People its appreciation for the role it has played in mobilizing international public opinion in support of the Palestinian people in their legitimate and just struggle to regain their inalienable rights to self-determination and to establish their own independent State on their national soil .  
The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity from the most critical phase in our independent development is , to a large extent , to the credit of the United Nations and its specialized agencies , which provided Georgia not only with moral support but with specific and timely financial and technical assistance . 
The Australian Government \ x { e5b8 } policy on the Middle East is based on long-standing and firmly established principles a fundamental commitment to Israel \ x { e5b8 } right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination acknowledging that the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity , including the possibility of an independent State , is subject to the final status negotiations between the parties directly involved .  
It will be composed of 29 members , of whom 14 will be drawn from the Government 10 of them ministers and 15 from the business , labour and academic spheres ; local authorities ; non-governmental organizations from the economic , social and environmental spheres ; congressional representatives ; and three independent members .  
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
The Canberra Commission was a body of independent experts and eminent persons commissioned by the Australian Government to address the fundamental questions of whether a nuclear _ weapon _ free world is feasible and , if so , the measures which could be taken to attain that objective .  
The establishment and functioning of the Commission on the Strengthening of the Justice System should provide the country with a historic opportunity to undertake , based on a broad debate , a judicial reform that meets society 's tremendous need for an independent , professionally sound justice system which can restore public confidence .  
The statements and utterances credited to the two Thematic Rapporteurs were not only unfortunate , they were also capable of undermining the impartiality and integrity of these independent and neutral experts appointed by sovereign independent states in the Commission of Human Rights in which Nigeria is an active member .  
A prevalence of environmental inequities based on socio _ economic and racial factors has been reported : of the two factors , race appears to have both an independent and a more important relationship with the distribution of commercial hazardous waste facilities than income .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
Observing scientifically the changes in the international situation , Mr . Deng Xiaoping led us in the reshaping of an international strategy adhering to an independent foreign policy of peace , safeguarding world peace , promoting world development and opposing hegemonism and power politics , thus opening up a new situation in China 's relations with foreign countries in a new era , and making historic contributions to developing and strengthening China 's friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
One way to introduce more rational pricing would be to eliminate politically motivated price controls , shifting the responsibility for determining and monitoring price guidelines to independent regulatory authorities , with consumer representation and acting within the framework of transparent rules .  
He called for increasing contacts across the Taiwan Straits and negotiations that would lead to reunification in which Taiwan would ' exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication ' and ' may also retain its armed forces and administer its party , governmental and military systems by itself ' .  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
Calls upon relevant cantonal governments and local authorities to take the necessary steps to end beatings , unlawful evictions and other forms of harassment , particularly in multi-ethnic areas such as Mostar and Stolac , complying fully with the demands of the Security Council contained in the statement of its President of 19 March 1997 , and to prosecute to the full extent of the law before an independent and impartial tribunal those identified in the report of the International Police Task Force concerning the incidents in Mostar on 10 February 1997 ;  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
Whereas the Oslo , Washington and Cairo accords raised hopeful prospects for a just and lasting peaceful solution leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital , the new Israeli Government has embarked on a policy of colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories with the aim of creating situations of fait accompli on the ground .  
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
Difficult and painful reform lies ahead if Albania is to succeed in fostering political and social reconciliation , economic development , consolidation of a fully functioning and independent judiciary and electronic media , and the creation of active civil-society institutions .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
An independent and powerful judiciary should have the capacity to establish sustainable lasting and autonomous control policies independent from the executive and legislative branches , with a clear responsibility oriented to public service , responding in an opportune , impartial , balanced , effective and transparent manner to all demands that are placed before it .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
On the other hand , they themselves engage in massive sales of advanced weapons and equipment to sensitive regions , infringing upon the national sovereignty of other countries and damaging regional peace and stability .  The Chinese Government adheres to Mr . Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on diplomatic endeavours and firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace .  
The present report has highlighted the growing role of independent national institutions in promoting and protecting human rights , a factor increasingly recognized as important in ensuring effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs , representatives and independent experts have regularly provided valuable information on specific human rights problems having the potential of generating mass exoduses or preventing their resolution , together with recommendations for corrective measures .  
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .  
The court should be impartial and independent , complementary to national criminal justice systems but not subordinate to them or to any national or international political body .  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
As public gatherings are considered by individuals and groups as the last remaining alternative means to express publicly differing views and opinions , given the denial of access to Government _ controlled media and the harassment of the independent press , the direct and indirect limitations presently imposed on such events must be considered highly undesirable .  
The annex makes reference to the identification by the Panel of numerous practical disadvantages to independent audits and management reviews by individual Member States and to the fact that the Financial Regulations of the United Nations stipulate that the external auditors appointed by the organizations ' governing bodies are solely responsible for the conduct of audits .  
A credible and independent human rights commission , along with a genuinely independent national electoral commission , could make an important contribution to protecting stability and promoting the observance of human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we strongly hope will be free , fair and credible elections in May next year .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
In conclusion , my delegation takes this opportunity to strongly reaffirm Malaysia 's well-known position of total commitment and unwavering support for , and abiding solidarity with , the Palestinian people in their valiant struggle for a just and lasting peace and for an independent sovereign state of Palestine , with Jerusalem , the sacred city of Muslims , Christians and Jews , as its capital . 
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
The Committee agreed on the indicative two-year work programme outlined below , and decided to prepare for its thirty-first session ( New York , May 1997 ) by convening three working groups , which would be supported by relevant studies to be undertaken by the Secretariat and independent experts on the themes selected .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
Approves the methods of work employed by the Special Rapporteur , in particular as regards urgent appeals , reiterates his need to be able to respond effectively to credible and reliable information that comes before him , invites him to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned , including Member States , in the elaboration of his report , and expresses its appreciation of the continuing discrete and independent way in which he carries out his work ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
At its fifty _ second session the Commission on Human Rights decided , without a vote , that all continuing thematic or country _ oriented mandates established by the Commission and entrusted to special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups are expected to report to the fifty _ third session ( decision 1996 / 113 ) .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
One of 20 substantive themes identified for the advisory services programme is treaty reporting and international obligations ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 , para . 23 ) , but the independent expert has not been able to identify from the available documentation any case in which assistance has been provided specifically for either the undertaking of a survey of the necessary measures to be taken prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or the preparation of a report to a treaty body .  
I would just like to mention several items deserving of careful consideration at this essential stage of the preparations : the urgent installation of the independent Electoral Commission and the reconstituted Supreme Court ; the registration of voters ; and the return of refugees and I would like to stress that this is indispensable for the credibility of the entire electoral process .  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
In this regard , they concurred on the need for a process of transition leading to transparent , fair and inclusive elections which would be organized and supervised by an independent body and monitored by the international community .  
Calls upon relevant cantonal governments and local authorities to take the necessary steps to end beatings , unlawful evictions and other forms of harassment , particularly in multi-ethnic areas such as Mostar and Stolac , complying fully with the demands of the Security Council contained in the statement of its President of 19 March 1997 , and to prosecute to the full extent of the law before an independent and impartial tribunal those identified in the report of the International Police Task Force concerning the incidents in Mostar on 10 February 1997 ;  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
The European Union welcomes the formal undertaking by the Belarus authorities to initiate consultations with all the deputies of the elected thirteenth Supreme Soviet to establish a proper balance between the functions and duties of the members of the legislative , executive and judicial powers , as well as devise mechanisms that would strengthen respect for human rights and the position of the independent media .  
Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
Particular attention should be paid to protecting the rights of children deprived of their liberty , especially those living in corrective labour institutions , to the establishment of an appropriate and independent monitoring mechanism , and to the improvement of the quality and adequacy of alternative measures to imprisonment .  
The Presidents agree that the peoples of the Russian Federation and Ukraine shall continue to live and work in peace and harmony , supporting each other at a crucial stage in their history , when they are carrying out , in their independent sovereign States , large-scale reforms with a view to establishing a democratic society and a State based on rule of law , with a socially oriented market economy .  
Additional views expressed were that the rules should address the issue of whether a member of the Commission who was a national of a coastal State making a submission could not serve in the subcommission considering that State 's submission while another member of the Commission who was a national of an adjacent or opposite State served in the subcommission ; that the Commission , being an independent body , might wish to consider the potential usefulness of drawing upon outside expertise ; however , the latter view was not shared by others .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and in particular to its Chairperson _ Rapporteur , Ms . Erica _ Irene Daes , for the important and constructive work accomplished during its fifteenth session ; 2 .  Requests the Secretary _ General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its fifteenth session to indigenous organizations , Governments and intergovernmental and non _ governmental organizations concerned , as well as to all thematic rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups ;  
It also firmly supported the work of the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) as the independent international authority responsible for the objective and balanced evaluation of the efforts of States to establish a global narcotics control policy and genuine international cooperation in that area .  
That initiative , which benefitted from substantial Government funding , had been very well received by organizations of the civil society and was the basis for the action to be taken to establish , under the supervision of an independent body composed of governmental and non-governmental representatives , minimum rules for the treatment of offenders .  
The lessons learned earlier in Rwanda and Somalia , and in Afghanistan during 1996 , showed that as long as political mediation , military and security operations , emergency relief and development assistance operated largely as independent policy instruments , the international response to large-scale violence would be incoherent and ineffective .  
The Bretton Woods institutions had made a major step in that direction by endorsing the action programme of the initiative to reduce the debt burden of highly indebted poor countries ; under that initiative the three main groups of creditor countries had confirmed that they would take coordinated , simultaneous , but independent action , and would share the costs equitably ; they had also accepted a flexible structure and a case-by-case approach to take into account the characteristics of the economies of the heavily indebted poor countries .  
The Government of Mexico , in full respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of self-determination of peoples , and the norms and principles which govern peaceful and friendly relations and cooperation among nations , believes that it is for the people of Cuba alone , in exercise of their inalienable rights , to continue to determine their own political , economic and social organization in a free , sovereign and independent manner .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent and representative , and it should influence both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners , and it must occur at all appropriate levels of government .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
Although his previous requests have remained unanswered , the Special Rapporteur is still waiting for the existing Government to carry out an independent , neutral , objective and complete investigation into the exact circumstances of the murder of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 1996 , near Mugina , Cibitoke province , to establish clearly who was responsible , and to publish the results without further delay .  
In subsequent statements , particularly , those entitled " political development policies " of the executive branches , emphasis was again placed on respecting human dignity and integrity ; ensuring civil rights and freedom ; defending public trials and the right to a lawyer ; fostering an independent mass media ; and fostering the principles of pluralism and diversity .  
From the time Kyrgyzstan became independent , we have pursued a policy of developing and strengthening broad regional and international cooperation in specific areas , including the control of narcotic drugs .  
The independent expert considered that the advisory services programme had not provided sufficient support for surveys required prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or for the preparation of reports by States in need of assistance .  
With regard to the right to a competent , independent and impartial judge , the Special Rapporteur would like to assess the civil and the military faceless judges in light of international standards .  
The human rights treaty system , established under the six operative international human rights treaties , consists of a voluntary system of self-monitoring by way of reporting , supervised by six independent and expert international committees .  
It also included a compilation of the views of Committee members on the report of the independent expert on the functioning of the human rights treaty bodies and addressed issues raised at the eighth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies .  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to facilitate a broad public debate on how a national human rights commission can be made an independent and effective institution , established by law and based on recognized international norms ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to facilitate a broad public debate on how a national human rights commission can be made an independent and effective institution , established by law and based on recognized international norms ;  
An independent central bank not only ensures low and stable rates of inflation , but through its autonomy from governmental interference in monetary policy also contributes to a healthy division of power in the economic sphere .  
In this context , let me emphasize Slovenia \ x { e5b8 } strong commitment to the establishment of an independent , impartial and effective permanent international criminal court at the Diplomatic Conference to be held in Rome in June and July of this year .  
The greatest challenge faced by Haiti was to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic and equitable judicial system available to all .  
DIOP ( Senegal ) supported the view expressed by earlier speakers that a strong , independent Prosecutor empowered to obtain information ex officio was crucial if the Court was to be effective .  
An independent and impartial court required full-time judges , who should have high intellectual and moral qualities and professional competence in both criminal law and international humanitarian law .  
By adopting the Statute of a permanent , independent , effective , transparent and non-selective international criminal court , the Conference would be leaving an enduring legacy to future generations .  
RAIG ( Estonia ) said that a permanent , independent , impartial and effective international criminal court was needed , in the light of persistent gross violations of human rights .  
Her organization agreed that a strong , independent and effective international criminal court was needed , and considered that the Conference should focus on the three core crimes , together with aggression if it was so decided .  
Some other critical elements include well-functioning legislative and judicial systems , respect for political , economic and social rights , an independent media , use of legal norms , and predictable rules for decision-making and conflict resolution .  
They stressed that the basic principles of a democratic State governed by the rule of law included multi-partyism , freedom of the press , an independent judiciary and free , fair and transparent elections .  
UNDCP has three main sources of expertise : its own internal experts appointed on permanent or fixed-term contracts ; national and international institutions involved in drug-related issues ; and independent consultants .  
As the expert had already observed , the greatest challenge faced by Haiti is to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable judicial system available to all .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
A strong and independent judiciary is unthinkable in any political system other than a genuine democracy in which there is a clear separation of the three state powers : the executive , the legislative and the judicial .

During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
The independent expert is closely associated with the implementation of this component , particularly since he shares the MICIVIH approach of according absolute priority to strengthening the network of local NGOs engaged in protecting human rights , a priority which is all the more justified because , to the great regret of the independent expert , the mandate of MICIVIH could not be renewed .

Peru had recognized the Inter-American Court 's jurisdiction unconditionally in 1991 , without reservations and for an indeterminate period , and by doing so had granted Peruvian citizens the benefit of access to independent international judicial proceedings in cases where their rights had been violated and it had not been possible to obtain suitable redress through the national courts . 
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .

My country reaffirms its principled position that just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East must be based , first and foremost , on the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , particularly their right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent State with Al-Quds as its capital .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52-227 , requested the Secretary-General to include in his tenth progress report a detailed plan of action and information on the final level of resources needed to resolve all outstanding problems so as to make the system fully operational , taking into account , inter alia , the study by the independent experts .

The independent experts had identified the shortcomings that had made the development of IMIS difficult , including the lack of a corporate information technology plan for the Secretariat , the continuous lack of adequate internal staff , the gross underestimation of the level of effort required for report-writing , and delays in setting up operations support within user offices .  
Furthermore , it has been alleged that trials being conducted for genocidal crimes in which the death penalty is the primary punishment continue to deny the accused rights ensured and protected by international law.This includes , but is not limited to , the right to legal representation , the right to appeal , and other safeguards such as the presumption of innocence and an independent judicial tribunal .

We therefore feel justified in wondering how it can be proper for the Commission to relay dubious information and issue it in a Security Council document without having had it verified by independent sources , in particular since this information relates to grave and sensitive issues , namely , the violation of Security Council resolutions concerning the embargo on the sale of arms .  
In order to achieve the desired level of independence it is advisable to separate the regulatory functions from operational ones by removing any regulatory functions that may still be vested with the public service providers and entrust them to a legally and functionally independent entity .  
Although it seems obvious , we must remember that this draft resolution calls for negotiating the complete , comprehensive prohibition of anti-personnel landmines , and that independent of the irresponsible or indiscriminate use of landmines on many occasions , it is no secret to anyone that even now , many countries use landmines to defend themselves against foreign aggression .  
It was of paramount importance that the Court be truly independent , fair , effective and efficient , so that it could dispense justice in accordance with principles acceptable to the international community , bearing in mind diverse legal systems and cultures .

Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , and the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;

In order to complete successfully the radical political and economic reforms which are being carried out in the country and to achieve the lofty goals set forth in the Constitution of our independent State , there is a great need for a healthy opposition .  
This involved the development of Land administrations , an independent judiciary , labour and social administrations , and the federal administrations and other institutions required for the functioning of a democratic constitutional State .

We wish to design the strategic guidelines for the development of East Timor as the most effective means to correctly allocate both human and material resources and to obtain genuine sustainable development for the newly emerging independent nation .  
My delegation remains convinced that an independent East Timor , established in democratic pluralism based on the national pact referred to by Mr . Ramos-Horta , should be assisted by the United Nations and the entire international community .  
Societies in which citizens can openly air their grievances ; choose their governments in free , open elections ; have a say , through elected local bodies , in aspects of governance that touch their daily lives the most ; and get redress when they need it from an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law , are far less likely to erupt into domestic conflict than those under totalitarian or military rule .

We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
However , for independence to be fully enjoyed , the following three pillars are essential for a functioning democracy in a new , independent country : an impartial and independent judiciary , a competent and fully trained civilian police service , and a solid and broad-based administrative framework .  
It is fitting that Ireland , as a strong and consistent supporter of East Timors peaceful transition to a stable , democratic and effective and independent State , is presiding over the Council at this important point in East Timors transition process .  
In conclusion , as East Timor grows into a full-fledged sovereign and independent nation , the international community has a solemn responsibility to support measures including building bridges of understanding towards achieving reconciliation , strengthening the foundations of government based on democratic and transparent practices , and promoting capacity-building programmes .  
In this context , we see the reported achievements especially as establishing conditions on the ground allowing the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be free to decide to return to their pre-war homes or to choose to live elsewhere , and as developing a modern , independent and effective judiciary system as well as responsible and non-political police structures .  
As far as France is concerned , this settlement must be based , on the one hand , on the reaffirmation and full recognition of Israels irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders , and , on the other hand , on the establishment of a viable , independent and democratic Palestinian State , and this means the end of the occupation of Palestinian territories .

I wrote to Ch'iao Kuan-hua pointing out that this analogy proved the opposite of what was intended . Ireland had been under English rule longer than Taiwan had been under Chinese rule but had become independent . What the argument actually showed was that the Chinese Communists were more imperialistic than the extreme British conservatives who opposed Irish independence . What Yeh Chien-ying 's proposals try to do is to make a concession to Western feelings by claiming the Chinese Communist Party would be satisfied with purely nominal unification .  
Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered .

Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle .

Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent .

Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .

The first book he ever bought himself was Stories from Chinese History .

On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .

As to paragraph 6 , in which Iraq was accused of impeding the equitable distribution of foodstuffs among the regions , it was completely divorced from reality as clearly reflected in independent international reports ; the latter were eloquent in their praises of the system whereby provisions were delivered to the north , as well as to the centre and the south , without any discrimination . 
Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 8 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .

The mission further recommended that Member States should be encouraged to support intensive and sustained efforts to develop a broad-based and independent media in Burundi as an essential complement to diplomatic , humanitarian , human rights and development efforts already under way .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in order to ensure a strong and independent administration of justice ;  
He also stressed that the establishment of an independent economy and sustainable economic development would necessarily require a diversified production base , free trade relations with Israel and the transformation from dependency on exporting the labour force to production and exports to foreign markets .  
This requires : complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 ; complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the internationally recognized boundaries ; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian territories , including Arab Jerusalem ; and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its right to exercise self-determination and establish an independent State on its own soil . 
In its resolution 1996 / 59 of 19 April 1996 , the Commission expressed its satisfaction with the boost given to the negotiations which sought to achieve agreements on the pending items on the agenda , with the corresponding mechanisms for verification ; regretted the persistence of serious violations ; recognized the positive role played by MINUGUA in promoting the peace process ; and decided to request the extension of the mandate of the independent expert .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
The Working Group was established by the Commission in its resolution 1991 / 42 of 5 March 1991 , by which the Commission decided " to create , for a three-year period , a working group composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned " . 
We in the OIC believe in speeding up the peace process and aim at putting it back on track with a view to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region and restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their right to return , their right to self-determination and their right to build their own independent State on their national soil with Al-Quds al - Sharif as its capital , as well as a complete and speedy Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and occupied Lebanese territories .  
Having reviewed the steps taken towards the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 50 / 145 and 50 / 146 , including other relevant mandates in this area , it can be concluded that the credibility of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme will be measured , to a large extent , by its ability to provide effective support to requesting countries in drafting legislation , creating independent systems for the administration of justice , establishing police forces that are respectful of the rule of law and setting up national institutions for protecting fundamental human rights .

At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .

The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
IMIS is progressively replacing the numerous independent systems , many of which , built many years ago and mostly for regular budget activities , are no longer able to provide the support needed by management at a time of rapidly changing needs and increasing demands made on the administrative sector to support extensive peacekeeping activities and those financed from extrabudgetary resources .

A credible and independent human rights commission , along with a genuinely independent national electoral commission , could make an important contribution to protecting stability and promoting the observance of human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we strongly hope will be free , fair and credible elections in May next year .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
In conclusion , my delegation takes this opportunity to strongly reaffirm Malaysia 's well-known position of total commitment and unwavering support for , and abiding solidarity with , the Palestinian people in their valiant struggle for a just and lasting peace and for an independent sovereign state of Palestine , with Jerusalem , the sacred city of Muslims , Christians and Jews , as its capital . 
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .

Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
Approves the methods of work employed by the Special Rapporteur , in particular as regards urgent appeals , reiterates his need to be able to respond effectively to credible and reliable information that comes before him , invites him to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned , including Member States , in the elaboration of his report , and expresses its appreciation of the continuing discrete and independent way in which he carries out his work ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;

Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
One of 20 substantive themes identified for the advisory services programme is treaty reporting and international obligations ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 , para . 23 ) , but the independent expert has not been able to identify from the available documentation any case in which assistance has been provided specifically for either the undertaking of a survey of the necessary measures to be taken prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or the preparation of a report to a treaty body .  
I would just like to mention several items deserving of careful consideration at this essential stage of the preparations : the urgent installation of the independent Electoral Commission and the reconstituted Supreme Court ; the registration of voters ; and the return of refugees and I would like to stress that this is indispensable for the credibility of the entire electoral process .  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;

In this regard , they concurred on the need for a process of transition leading to transparent , fair and inclusive elections which would be organized and supervised by an independent body and monitored by the international community .  
Calls upon relevant cantonal governments and local authorities to take the necessary steps to end beatings , unlawful evictions and other forms of harassment , particularly in multi-ethnic areas such as Mostar and Stolac , complying fully with the demands of the Security Council contained in the statement of its President of 19 March 1997 , and to prosecute to the full extent of the law before an independent and impartial tribunal those identified in the report of the International Police Task Force concerning the incidents in Mostar on 10 February 1997 ;  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .

Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;

At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .

In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
The European Union welcomes the formal undertaking by the Belarus authorities to initiate consultations with all the deputies of the elected thirteenth Supreme Soviet to establish a proper balance between the functions and duties of the members of the legislative , executive and judicial powers , as well as devise mechanisms that would strengthen respect for human rights and the position of the independent media .  
Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .

Additional views expressed were that the rules should address the issue of whether a member of the Commission who was a national of a coastal State making a submission could not serve in the subcommission considering that State 's submission while another member of the Commission who was a national of an adjacent or opposite State served in the subcommission ; that the Commission , being an independent body , might wish to consider the potential usefulness of drawing upon outside expertise ; however , the latter view was not shared by others .

The lessons learned earlier in Rwanda and Somalia , and in Afghanistan during 1996 , showed that as long as political mediation , military and security operations , emergency relief and development assistance operated largely as independent policy instruments , the international response to large-scale violence would be incoherent and ineffective .  
The Bretton Woods institutions had made a major step in that direction by endorsing the action programme of the initiative to reduce the debt burden of highly indebted poor countries ; under that initiative the three main groups of creditor countries had confirmed that they would take coordinated , simultaneous , but independent action , and would share the costs equitably ; they had also accepted a flexible structure and a case-by-case approach to take into account the characteristics of the economies of the heavily indebted poor countries .  
The Government of Mexico , in full respect for the sovereignty of States and the right of self-determination of peoples , and the norms and principles which govern peaceful and friendly relations and cooperation among nations , believes that it is for the people of Cuba alone , in exercise of their inalienable rights , to continue to determine their own political , economic and social organization in a free , sovereign and independent manner .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent and representative , and it should influence both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners , and it must occur at all appropriate levels of government .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
Although his previous requests have remained unanswered , the Special Rapporteur is still waiting for the existing Government to carry out an independent , neutral , objective and complete investigation into the exact circumstances of the murder of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 1996 , near Mugina , Cibitoke province , to establish clearly who was responsible , and to publish the results without further delay .

During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
The independent expert is closely associated with the implementation of this component , particularly since he shares the MICIVIH approach of according absolute priority to strengthening the network of local NGOs engaged in protecting human rights , a priority which is all the more justified because , to the great regret of the independent expert , the mandate of MICIVIH could not be renewed .

Many formally independent countries were really in a state of dependence because of a growing burden of indebtedness , dwindling official development assistance , and the negative impact of globalization and market liberalization , all aggravated by the imposition of standard political , economic and social models that took no account of differences in identity , culture , degree of development and the like .  
Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues , the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority , as set out in the international drug control treaties ,  
You are , of course , aware of the economic embargo of the past nine years and of the fact that these years have been punctuated by constant military assaults , planned and carried out by the United States , targeting all aspects of life and based on the refusal of that country to allow the people of Iraq to live a life of dignity and exercise its free and independent will .

We therefore feel justified in wondering how it can be proper for the Commission to relay dubious information and issue it in a Security Council document without having had it verified by independent sources , in particular since this information relates to grave and sensitive issues , namely , the violation of Security Council resolutions concerning the embargo on the sale of arms .  
In order to achieve the desired level of independence it is advisable to separate the regulatory functions from operational ones by removing any regulatory functions that may still be vested with the public service providers and entrust them to a legally and functionally independent entity .

Societies in which citizens can openly air their grievances ; choose their governments in free , open elections ; have a say , through elected local bodies , in aspects of governance that touch their daily lives the most ; and get redress when they need it from an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law , are far less likely to erupt into domestic conflict than those under totalitarian or military rule .

In this context , we see the reported achievements especially as establishing conditions on the ground allowing the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be free to decide to return to their pre-war homes or to choose to live elsewhere , and as developing a modern , independent and effective judiciary system as well as responsible and non-political police structures .
