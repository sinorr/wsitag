Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .

Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development .

Looking further ahead , " in fact , education for the gifted should n't be a monopoly of the elite , " teacher Lin Chih-chung says . " Everyone has the right to being trained in nonrigid thinking .

Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "

Fake silk is warmer , and tends to be more smooth and shiny .  
But if cars can pass through on a new cross-island highway , people will just drive through , passing Yuli in an instant . " It 's like when the southern cross-island highway was built , " he says . " At first everyone at the eastern starting point of Haituan was vigorously in favor of opening the road , thinking that people would be able to get to Taitung in only an hour , but since then the city has been in gradual decline . "  
With the zeal of a missionary , he grabs at any opportunity to pass along his views on art to the people of his homeland - - making up for the many years he was barred from coming home .

When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh .

The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?

" Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
Actually this is partly because since people feared vicious dogs , it was only natural for them to compare them jestingly with the even more ferocious tiger , as in this joke about an " illiterate dog " : In olden times legend had it that the written character for tiger , or the character for the tiger 's associated Earthly Branch yin , had the power to subdue a dog . There was once a dog which liked to bite people , and everyone was afraid of it and did not dare to pass it .

The banners blow in the wind as if swaying with the music . The divine generals having been called down , the heavenly soldiers and horses were also called upon , and the soul of the deceased was asked to enter the palanquin . With the old woman , one of three main players in the company , taking the role of the benevolent Mother Goddess walking in front , and the ang-yi medium trailing behind , the procession sets off to " pass through the obstacles and challenges on the road to Paradise . "  
There can be few among the travellers hurrying north or south along the section of the freeway between Tai-an and Sanyi who are not struck by the sudden appearance of this desolate , barren scenery where plain meets plateau , as they pass by the Taan River and Huoyan Mountains . As far as the eye can see , there is no sign of human activity , apart from the matchbox-like gravel trucks on the river embankments .  
Once I helped people pass out leaflets , but my boss got mad at me because I was slow , and I left . I went to a boxed lunch shop and helped them carry the boxed lunches , but it was too tiring . After a week , I did n't go back . Then I worked at my brother 's friend 's travel agency answering phones for two months .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did .

The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs . Some are bearing little palanquins in which are seated statues of the village gods ; they excitedly crowd around Matsu 's seat of honor as it moves its way forward .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
Then people would start yelling or crying or having other strong emotional reactions . When the physical problems appeared , Mesmer and his assistants would massage the afflicted part of the body to " prompt the magnetic fluid to pass through . " The results appeared to be quite good .  
On an ordinary day , however , the couple live very much at peace . They pass their time wandering about the compound , sleeping , bathing , and enjoying breakfast and dinner , which they receive at set times every day . The memories of war have already faded in the distance .  
According to our youngest writer and photographer , who with great courage and professionalism personally tried paragliding , it is worth it .

As for myself , however , I will pass - - my daring has faded with the years , and I will have to fly vicariously through our article .  
Lately Taipei has been all abuzz over the " Lu An-ni incident . " Lu , a student who did not pass the examination to enter a doctoral program , accused professors who gave her the oral examination of plagiarism and sexual harassment . The professors responded that they had done nothing of the kind , and that Lu had an ulterior motive for making the charges .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs .

With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species .

It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
Such endings are both happy and tragic , for they never go outside the conventional standards of life in the material world .

"  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times .

In the deep of night the flowers might be sleeping , but as every minute of spring is to be treasured like gold , why not light some candles and spread some lanterns to illuminate a night-time banquet , and pass the time in their company ?  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
" Today 's exam system produces people who only know how to pass exams . The ones who are no good at exams go into the dummies ' class , and those who fail are filled with a sense of inferiority ; by that time , it 's too late to save them . " Under soft yellow lamplight in a simple but elegant teahouse , a circle of listeners attentively watch the speaker in the middle .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Evidently some people have found chess so addictive that they have neither slept nor rested , and there is a saying to the effect that " thoughts of spring make it hard to sleep , but chess can help pass a clear night . " No wonder some ancient chess aficionados declared that unless they were in contact with chess , their chi ( energy flow ) and pulse would become irregular and unsteady , and their brains would atrophy .  
Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations . We do n't have any kind of life experience that 's worth being proud of , that we can pass on to the next generation . "  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
Then , in the 1930s , Bell Laboratories in the US detected radio waves coming from the Milky Way galaxy , and researchers became aware that there are many signals in the universe that are invisible to the naked eye . Some of these electromagnetic waves can pass through dust clouds that block visible light , and can thereby reveal many unknown celestial worlds .  
Finally the car arrives at legendary Danaiku , where you pass under two arched gateways to enter the Danaiku Ecological Park . This afternoon clouds and fog have come billowing in around the mountains , and the park 's meandering paths impart the feeling of a scenic spot in ancient China . You descend stairs along a path lined with ferns and other shade-loving plants .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .

In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair .

Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree .

" Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
Actually this is partly because since people feared vicious dogs , it was only natural for them to compare them jestingly with the even more ferocious tiger , as in this joke about an " illiterate dog " : In olden times legend had it that the written character for tiger , or the character for the tiger 's associated Earthly Branch yin , had the power to subdue a dog .

The banners blow in the wind as if swaying with the music .

There can be few among the travellers hurrying north or south along the section of the freeway between Tai-an and Sanyi who are not struck by the sudden appearance of this desolate , barren scenery where plain meets plateau , as they pass by the Taan River and Huoyan Mountains .

But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?

" Lu , a student who did not pass the examination to enter a doctoral program , accused professors who gave her the oral examination of plagiarism and sexual harassment . The professors responded that they had done nothing of the kind , and that Lu had an ulterior motive for making the charges .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . " One just has to pass the test to get a commercial driver 's license and sign up with a cab company , and one can immediately get on the road and start earning money .  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
Bruce Yang , who was a rehabilitation specialist at a major hospital in southern Taiwan , explains that physicians who are able to migrate to New Zealand are mostly already respected doctors at large hospitals in Taiwan , but to requalify in New Zealand they have to take examinations in both clinical practice and basic theory . Even if they do manage to pass and obtain a license to practice , they then have to serve a probationary period as junior hospital doctors .  
It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
Such endings are both happy and tragic , for they never go outside the conventional standards of life in the material world . Even today , many parents are tied to the notion that " in books one will naturally find a face as pretty as jade , " and admonish their children to " study hard-once you pass the exams and get into university , there 'll be plenty of pretty girls ! "  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
After cold fronts pass through , however , bird associations are always telling bird watchers to rush off to the seashore and mouths of rivers . If their luck is good , they may be able to see wild geese blown off course by the rough weather .  
When she had a big gash knocked in the back of her head , with her blood gushing out , the world moving in slow motion and the suddenly amplified sound of her heartbeat and breathing ringing in her ears , she did n't want go to a hospital because to save money she had n't bought health insurance . Meanwhile her friends were trying to staunch her bleeding while at the same time shaking her and shouting at her for all they were worth so as not to let her pass out . . . .  
In the deep of night the flowers might be sleeping , but as every minute of spring is to be treasured like gold , why not light some candles and spread some lanterns to illuminate a night-time banquet , and pass the time in their company ?  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
" Today 's exam system produces people who only know how to pass exams . The ones who are no good at exams go into the dummies ' class , and those who fail are filled with a sense of inferiority ; by that time , it 's too late to save them . " Under soft yellow lamplight in a simple but elegant teahouse , a circle of listeners attentively watch the speaker in the middle .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Evidently some people have found chess so addictive that they have neither slept nor rested , and there is a saying to the effect that " thoughts of spring make it hard to sleep , but chess can help pass a clear night . " No wonder some ancient chess aficionados declared that unless they were in contact with chess , their chi ( energy flow ) and pulse would become irregular and unsteady , and their brains would atrophy .  
Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations . We do n't have any kind of life experience that 's worth being proud of , that we can pass on to the next generation . "  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
Then , in the 1930s , Bell Laboratories in the US detected radio waves coming from the Milky Way galaxy , and researchers became aware that there are many signals in the universe that are invisible to the naked eye . Some of these electromagnetic waves can pass through dust clouds that block visible light , and can thereby reveal many unknown celestial worlds .  
Finally the car arrives at legendary Danaiku , where you pass under two arched gateways to enter the Danaiku Ecological Park . This afternoon clouds and fog have come billowing in around the mountains , and the park 's meandering paths impart the feeling of a scenic spot in ancient China . You descend stairs along a path lined with ferns and other shade-loving plants .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
In order to protect Penghu 's precious basalt formations , as well as the countless sea birds that pass by here , in 1993 the Council of Agriculture , acting on suggestions from academics , declared a group of islands in the southeast part of Penghu which rarely see human activity to be the Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Preserve . The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Boasting a total of over 200 Tang-era pieces that range from tricolor glazed pottery , ceramics , gold and silver works , glassware , and Buddhist relics , the exhibit assembles prized pieces from 12 museums in the mainland 's Shaanxi province . This is the most exhaustive and diverse single-dynasty exhibit to come along in recent years , and is something you do n't want to pass up .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
We 're not afraid of competition . The more people in Taiwan get into this industry the better , for strength comes from solidarity . " Eric Lee , president of Softstar Entertainment , a major local computer games company , says that companies such as Softstar , Wang Film and CGCG have already formed a strategic alliance . They have also set up an " academy of the new arts , " in which experienced industry workers teach courses in order to pass on their knowledge and skills as quickly as possible .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
Once you reduce its thickness to 50 nanometers , light can easily pass through it , so that it no longer reflects light . Its color changes from gold to red , and it becomes an excellent material for pregnancy test kits . Once gold is manufactured as thin as 50 nanometers , it goes from being extremely stable to being extremely volatile , allowing it to be used in many different applications as a catalyst or activator .  
In winter , the northeast monsoon makes for cold and wet weather with frequent fog and gusting rains on the northern side of the pass , while the southern side stays clear and dry . The very distinct climates make for radically different kinds of vegetation on the two sides of the pass .  
" I graduated second to last of my whole elementary school , " Lu explains . " My sister was my homeroom teacher during my first year in junior high . She felt that I learned too slowly , so she had me sent to the special education class . It took me four years to graduate from middle school , and because I could n't pass the high school entrance exam , I went to vocational school .  
Wang Dan 's identity gives his creative writing a free pass to the public , and even more to the mainstream media . But at the same time this also is a problem for him . It makes it unnecessary for him to pursue perfection in his literary life , and his obscure and emotional essay style readily reveals a literary technique that is not yet mature , and indeed a character that is equally childlike .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
" Exploration is a scientific endeavor , " he says . Aside from fostering personal courage , the ability to conquer fear , and other valuable characteristics , exploring can refine the skills needed for various outdoor activities and help foster discipline and self-improvement . " As a result , I can pass on the techniques I have learned to even more people . This is the main purpose of exploration , " Chen stresses .  
After the workshop concluded , the members went on to form the Wenshan Neovista Association , launching a series of talks , fighting for funding , planning the renovation effort , getting the opinions of local residents , and construction companies involved in the effort . After three years of hard work , they finally completed the project . Soon after completion the college opened the hall with a series of art and literature activities , using it to pass on the area 's rich art and culture .  
The man responsible for this is Liang Kuo-kuo , head of the Planning Department of the Taipei City Traffic Bureau 's Traffic Engineering Office . Hsinyi District is fairly big , says Liang , and the cycle lanes head along the " green belt " planned for each side of the district . The lanes pass along Sungkao Rd . , Sungchi Rd . , Sungjen Rd . and Sungteh Rd . , covering a total of 10.5 kilometers , and allow the public to ride along a shaded area and enjoy a bit of fresh air .  
" While the adjustments may be difficult for a time , these crises will pass , " he said , stressing that " stronger individual economies and a more robust and efficient international economic and financial system will surely emerge in their wake "  
Its failure to pass is regrettable , but that does not change the fact that a strict regime of economic measures directed at the Pale Serbs is already embodied in legal , binding resolutions of this Council , whose requirements are clear and unequivocal .  
Programmes for disadvantaged or vulnerable groups , in addition to reflecting a true understanding of the underlying problems of each group , must pass the test of being both equitable and efficient .  
Although there were guard posts at all gates and entry into the compound was limited to those who either held a regular pass or were given temporary passes , bogus passes , which were indistinguishable from the genuine ones , could easily be bought at the Bakara market of the city .  
Although the minimum qualifications required - eight years policing experience , ability to communicate in English and driving skills - have been specified to Governments , the number of those who failed to meet the criteria and to pass the required elementary tests upon arrival in the theatre has risen to alarming levels .  
It must be pointed out here that children and adolescents are targeted by this education-for-health programme as recipients and agents who can pass on the benefits , and health topics are increasingly incorporated in primary and secondary curricula as well as in cultural activities in schools and universities ( hygiene , nutrition , accident prevention , living with domestic animals , prevention of transmissible diseases , contraception , sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS . . . ) . 
I am firmly convinced that with the final fine tuning of these ultimate requirements , this United Nations compensation operation will pass into history as a model of effectiveness , correction and fairness in the delicate and difficult circumstances that led to its creation , and that its work , its rules and its results will guide and shape the outcome of future compensation operations .  
Whether through such a mechanism or direct allocations of budgetary expenditures by donors , the funds will need to be in place as increasing numbers of countries pass through the process .  50 .  Countries that begin the process are being told that at the end of an extended period of difficult adjustment measures they will still be in a parlous situation unless they receive a special degree of debt relief .  
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .

The Government , which has a minimal credit limit and is determined to abide by established budgetary norms , is making enormous financial sacrifices so as not to pass on the rising costs of petroleum products to the vulnerable segments of the population .  
The Government , which had been absorbing the bulk of this increase in international prices , was forced to pass it on at the pump . lectricit dHait then doubled its price per kilowatt , leading to a significant increase in production costs in the industrial sector , which was already in poor shape .
