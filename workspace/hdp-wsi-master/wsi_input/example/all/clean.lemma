The exposure and punishment according to law of black sheep and corrosive elements among customs personnel is in itself a major achievement in the anti-smuggling work and in the fight against corruption and in the campaign promoting clean and honest administration , which shows that our party and government not only persist in the reform and opening up policy but also harshly crack down on economic crimes , and demonstrates that our party and government have the determination and capabilities to punish corrupt elements and to eradicate cancerous tumors .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .

James Gradoville , a member of the delegation and Motorola regional director of Asia-Pacific government relations , told our reporters : We have consistently emphasized to members of Congress that it should pass a " clean resolution , without strings , " to enable American business to benefit from the opening up of the China market and enable Chinese enterprises to move toward the world still better ; at the same time this will provide a new and powerful motive force for spurring the steady and healthy development of Sino-US relations .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .

We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
Meanwhile , we should remain honest and clean in performing official duties , do a good job in the building of a sound party style , reinforce supervision by party organizations , strictly enforce discipline constraint , advocate a strict self-control , strictly demand leaders to assume responsibility for their work , and uphold the practice that every level is responsible for the work of its immediate subordinate level and that checks on implementation are made at all levels .

Practice has proved that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership mechanism , and the work setup and arrangements drawn up by the party Central Committee for the responsibility system over the building a sound party style and a clean administration are totally correct ; and so long as we can unswervingly carry them out in practice , the responsibility system for the building of a sound party style and a clean administration can surely play a greater role in the practice of running the party strictly .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .

Such policies should be complemented by other measures for promoting efficient and clean energy that take into account the widely differing institutional , social , economic , technical and natural resource endowment in individual countries and regions .  
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :

Leaders of respective places and units are convinced that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech has penetratingly analyzed the current situation and existing problems in party building from the strategic level of initiating a great project to improve the party , has incisively explained the great significance and utmost importance of tightening party discipline under the new situation , has put forward demands for tightening party discipline , and has clearly pointed out directions for improving the party 's style of work , promoting the building of a clean and honest government and launching struggles against corruption .  
In Sichuan Province , the secretary of the provincial party committee and the governor have assumed full responsibility for improving the style of the party , building a clean and honest government , and fighting against corruption .  They have divided this year 's anti-corruption work into 10 major tasks and 36 specific tasks .

The exposure and punishment according to law of black sheep and corrosive elements among customs personnel is in itself a major achievement in the anti-smuggling work and in the fight against corruption and in the campaign promoting clean and honest administration , which shows that our party and government not only persist in the reform and opening up policy but also harshly crack down on economic crimes , and demonstrates that our party and government have the determination and capabilities to punish corrupt elements and to eradicate cancerous tumors .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .

Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .

We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
Meanwhile , we should remain honest and clean in performing official duties , do a good job in the building of a sound party style , reinforce supervision by party organizations , strictly enforce discipline constraint , advocate a strict self-control , strictly demand leaders to assume responsibility for their work , and uphold the practice that every level is responsible for the work of its immediate subordinate level and that checks on implementation are made at all levels .

We should investigate and take actions against any leading cadre or any leading collective that has committed dereliction of duty in the building of a sound party style and clean administration and in anti-corruption work ; and if an individual leading cadre is found to be responsible , we should never allow anyone to shirk the responsibility on the excuse of collective responsibility , still less allow such a situation wherein no one is held responsible .  
Practice has proved that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership mechanism , and the work setup and arrangements drawn up by the party Central Committee for the responsibility system over the building a sound party style and a clean administration are totally correct ; and so long as we can unswervingly carry them out in practice , the responsibility system for the building of a sound party style and a clean administration can surely play a greater role in the practice of running the party strictly .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .
