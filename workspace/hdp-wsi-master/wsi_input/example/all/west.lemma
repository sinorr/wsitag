CPPCC Member Zhang Chunyuan answered a reporter 's question concerning the planning of this south-to-north water diversion project : Basing on their studies and verifications over the past 50 years , departments in charge of water conservancy have decided on a water diversion plan by which water will be diverted from the south to the north of China along three lines , namely , the east , the central , and the west lines , with a total water diversion volume of 38-40 billion cubic meters .  
The south-to-north water diversion project will be linked up with the Chang Jiang , the Huai He , the Huang He , and the Hai He , thus giving shape to the country 's overall water resources network characterized by " four horizontal and three vertical waterlines , water diversion from the south to the north , and mutual relief between the east and the west . "  
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .

Traditional Chinese desserts are quite different from the cakes , pies and puddings eaten in the west . They include sweet soups , steamed buns filled with sweet bean paste , and sweet glutinous rice topped with dried fruits and sweetened beans .  
The excited archeologists discovered that this trail was part of a lengthy road that traversed the central mountain range from the Chushan area in the west , to Yuli , near Hualien in the east . The total distance the trail covered was 120 kilometers . Known as Pat'ungkung in the native aboriginal dialect , the road was constructed during the reign of the Ching dynasty emperor Kuang Hsu ( also known as Teh Tsung , 1875-1908 ) .  
According to a Ching dynasty gazetteer , " Taiwan is surrounded on four sides by sea ; tall mountains extend from the north to the south . To the west our people live mixed with the indigenous people ; to the east live only the indigenous people . "

Malawi is located in southeast Africa , bordering on Zambia to the west , Tanzania to the northeast and Mozambique to the east and south . It has an area of 118,500 square kilometers , one fifth of which is covered by lakes .  
These combinations seem to accord with common sense , for instance wood " rules " the direction East because growing trees like the sunlight and the sun rises in the east . Metal similarly " rules " the West since metal is by nature cold and dead , and the west is the direction of the setting sun and the lack of light which spells etiolation for plant life .  
However , the east coast is shown as blank , and the central highlands are simply indicated by painted peaks , because the sheer mountains , and fierce tribes of those regions meant that Ching rule was ineffective beyond the coastal plain to the west .  
The majority are attracted by the numerous broad river estuaries and rich tidal marshes and mud-flats along Taiwan 's west coast , so there are far fewer migrant birds , and of fewer species , on the steeper eastern coast .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .

Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide . Taking the Sanmin area for example , within 8.4 kilometers to the west , the land rises from 500 meters above sea level to 3,300 meters , or an average of a rise of one meter for every three meters west that you go .  
You can find an oceanic current running by the islet on the east and west sides , the Kuroshio , which is a warm current from the equator . This comfortable and clear sea water has spawned a rich and beautiful foundation of ocean resources for Green Island .  
The aroma of caramel wafts into the room . A scent of roasted peanuts , the smell of stew , barbecued meat , herbal medicine , jasmine , dust , incense , charcoal . . . . " Such were the memories of Marguerite Duras , who was born and grew up in Vietnam under French colonial rule .

Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .

The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
" Chelungpu is a classic reverse fault . The east side of the fault was thrust diagonally upwards , and more or less everyone living along that side was killed or injured . But although the west side was subjected to the same violent shaking , most of the buildings remained standing . "

In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
The gleaming white Hsiyu Lighthouse , located at the island 's southwestern tip , guides ships as they ply between Xiamen , Penghu , and Taiwan , and fishermen working the seas to the west of Penghu depend on it in their nighttime operations .

In Lukang , the clans Hsu , Huang , and Shih controlled half the town / In the Qianlong reign , the city prospered , and the sails of boats were as numerous as flying fish / In Lukang , spring and autumn dreams , it rose and fell in a single 60-year cycle / Clouds from the west , currents from the east , tourists bring change without knowing what they do .  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .

The excited archeologists discovered that this trail was part of a lengthy road that traversed the central mountain range from the Chushan area in the west , to Yuli , near Hualien in the east . The total distance the trail covered was 120 kilometers . Known as Pat'ungkung in the native aboriginal dialect , the road was constructed during the reign of the Ching dynasty emperor Kuang Hsu ( also known as Teh Tsung , 1875-1908 ) .  
According to a Ching dynasty gazetteer , " Taiwan is surrounded on four sides by sea ; tall mountains extend from the north to the south . To the west our people live mixed with the indigenous people ; to the east live only the indigenous people . "  
One hundred years ago , Taipei was surrounded by a sturdy protective wall . The wall , completed in three years , was square , and had four gates , one in the north , south , east , and west . There was also another small gate on the southern side .  
According to the R . O . C . Tourism Society , geologic conditions in the west are not as favorable to the formation of gorges as in the east ; nevertheless , Matala has been especially favored by nature , and its waterfalls , caves , small lakes and other countless scenic wonders ( extremely reminiscent of Taroko Gorge in Hualien ) are a playground for the adventurous .  
In fact , flowers or " sacrifices , " aside from differences in religious connotation , both contain a single heartfelt meaning . And using animals as offerings has been known in both east and west ; in China , they also carry thousands of years of unbroken tradition and symbolic meaning .  
According to a survey done twenty years ago , the University of Chicago ranked third among American colleges and universities , enjoying a lofty academic reputation and battling it out for number one as a worthy representative for the Midwest against Harvard on the east coast and Stanford in the west .  
Malawi is located in southeast Africa , bordering on Zambia to the west , Tanzania to the northeast and Mozambique to the east and south . It has an area of 118,500 square kilometers , one fifth of which is covered by lakes .  
These combinations seem to accord with common sense , for instance wood " rules " the direction East because growing trees like the sunlight and the sun rises in the east . Metal similarly " rules " the West since metal is by nature cold and dead , and the west is the direction of the setting sun and the lack of light which spells etiolation for plant life .  
However , the east coast is shown as blank , and the central highlands are simply indicated by painted peaks , because the sheer mountains , and fierce tribes of those regions meant that Ching rule was ineffective beyond the coastal plain to the west .  
The majority are attracted by the numerous broad river estuaries and rich tidal marshes and mud-flats along Taiwan 's west coast , so there are far fewer migrant birds , and of fewer species , on the steeper eastern coast .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
We rested on a platform that seemed to overlook the whole planet . The settlement was visible far away at the mountain 's foot , girdled by a white stream flowing in a bow-shape to its left before meandering off into the west to shake hands with a row of low clouds .  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide . Taking the Sanmin area for example , within 8.4 kilometers to the west , the land rises from 500 meters above sea level to 3,300 meters , or an average of a rise of one meter for every three meters west that you go .  
You can find an oceanic current running by the islet on the east and west sides , the Kuroshio , which is a warm current from the equator . This comfortable and clear sea water has spawned a rich and beautiful foundation of ocean resources for Green Island .  
The aroma of caramel wafts into the room . A scent of roasted peanuts , the smell of stew , barbecued meat , herbal medicine , jasmine , dust , incense , charcoal . . . . " Such were the memories of Marguerite Duras , who was born and grew up in Vietnam under French colonial rule . In her novel L'amant , she recalls the elegance of Tan An , the Chinatown of Saigon ( today Ho Chi Minh City ) located in the west of the city 's sixth district .  
The road is named after the Chinese hero Tran Hung-dao , who led the Vietnamese in resistance against the invading Mongol armies of the Yuan dynasty in the fourteenth century . To the east of the road is the Vietnamese political and economic center ( now the first and third districts ) , while to the west is Tan An ( the fifth and sixth districts ) .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
Measurements show that it was an irregularly shaped rectangle , about 430 meters wide east to west and 540 meters long north to south . The area of the city was about 200,000 square meters . Archaeologists have even discovered remnants of city walls built to a height of six or seven meters . This dirt wall is from 4000 years before our time .  
Starting in the north at the mouth of the Hualien River , the designated area runs southward as far as Little Yehliu ; on the west it is bounded by the coastal mountain range running north-south parallel to the Central Mountain Range ; and in the east it runs into the Pacific Ocean .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
Waking from a dream of riches only to be executed , you feel that life is short / Life and death are fated , neither rich nor poor can escape / The seasons change , the sun sets in the west and the water still flows / Where is the general 's horse today , the field is covered with flowers and grass / Life is a lonely boat , day and night the water flows upward / The boat is smashed and repaired / Death brings respite from the affairs of the world .  
Tall and slender " Little Cutey " came onto the stage , a heavy cloak draped over her shoulders . Her body wriggled in serpentine motions . Every once in a while , she would unlatch her buttons and , walking toward the east end of the stage , flash open her cloak . Then she would walk toward the west end and flash her cloak open again .  
NanliaoOn the west coast of Green Island , there is a broad reef platform , about 20 to 30 meters across , connecting to a gently sloping coral reef , with coral hills , coral pillars and surge channels . The topographical variety is remarkable . With soft coral covering about 50-70% of the ocean floor , this is an " ocean flower garden " in its essence .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
As the end approaches it is best if the patient can lie in the auspicious position with their head to the north and their face to the west , but this should not be forced , and after breathing stops they should be left to lie naturally , and not moved .  
In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important . The single track was turned into a double track , and many of the old single-track tunnels were taken out of service . Now they are objects of our explorations .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
" Chelungpu is a classic reverse fault . The east side of the fault was thrust diagonally upwards , and more or less everyone living along that side was killed or injured . But although the west side was subjected to the same violent shaking , most of the buildings remained standing . "  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
Pinglin is located on the Taipei-Ilan Highway , 38 km east of Taipei , and 42 km west of Ilan . The area , covering 171 square kilometres , is mostly mountainous , with the Fushih Mountains to the north , the Ayu Mountains to the south , and the Peishih River meandering through it . Most of the population of more than 6000 is concentrated here in the river 's small floodplain .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
The gleaming white Hsiyu Lighthouse , located at the island 's southwestern tip , guides ships as they ply between Xiamen , Penghu , and Taiwan , and fishermen working the seas to the west of Penghu depend on it in their nighttime operations . The lighthouse is also a great spot for viewing the famous " Hsiyu sunset , " considered one of the eight most beautiful sights in Penghu .  
In Lukang , the clans Hsu , Huang , and Shih controlled half the town / In the Qianlong reign , the city prospered , and the sails of boats were as numerous as flying fish / In Lukang , spring and autumn dreams , it rose and fell in a single 60-year cycle / Clouds from the west , currents from the east , tourists bring change without knowing what they do .  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .

Bearing in mind the place where the unknown substance was released , it can be established that the most risky area for infection is a zone covering 15 to 20 kilometres to the west and 20 to 25 kilometres to the east of the Gir \ x { 93ee } air corridor , although the whole territory of Matanzas Province is considered a probable infected zone . 
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
However , my Office and the Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned that the authorities in west Mostar continue to ignore the international community 's demands that a full investigation and judicial proceedings based on new indictments be carried out in the cases of the three west Mostar policemen involved in the 10 February shooting incident , and that two other west Mostar policemen be suspended from their posts pending investigations into their involvement in the incident .  
The IPTF investigation concluded that the west Mostar police had used excessive force , in violation of national and international human rights standards , and that they had attempted to cover up the facts of the incident .  
According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .
