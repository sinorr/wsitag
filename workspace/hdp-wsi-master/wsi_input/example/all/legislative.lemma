The Ninth National People 's Congress [ NPC ] and its Standing Committee have continuously strengthened the legislative work over the past year , with a total of 33 draft laws examined and 24 of them approved .  The annual target of legislative work was thus achieved , and the endeavor of initially forming a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics during this term was moved forward .  
Qiao Xiaoyang said : Tremendous achievements have been scored in our country 's legislation work , but some problems have also cropped up in practical legislative work as legislation progresses at an accelerated pace and the number of laws enacted multiplies , such as legislation in excess of legal power , conflict and contradiction between different laws , regulations , and rules , low legislative quality , and lack of democratic procedures in legislation .  
Fourth , it is necessary to further improve the body of public security laws and regulations and comprehensively push forward the codification of public security work into the legal system and the building of the police force .  The 15th national party congress put forward the objectives and requirements for establishing and improving the socialist legal system .  It is necessary to go by these objectives and requirements and cater to the practical needs of public security work , making timely adjustments to the plans for , and pace of , public security legislative work ;  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .  They have made a positive , catalytic contribution to the consummation of the socialist legal system and to promoting the development of various local causes .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
President Jiang Zemin pointed out not long ago : After China participates in the " International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , " China will subject itself to the United Nations ' supervision , will conscientiously fulfill the state obligations specified by the " Covenant , " will effectively promote the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights for the Chinese citizens by legislative , administrative , and other means , and will thus make contributions to the human rights cause in the world .  
Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .  Both the ruling and the opposition parties have been trying their utmost to break through an encirclement at the year-end legislative elections .  
If we treat only the symptoms , not the root cause , we would not only be unable to consolidate the achievements that have been made in the rectification and improvement , but also lose such achievements altogether .  When that happened , the offense of making and selling counterfeit products would rear its ugly head again and may even become worse .  Therefore , firstly , the legislative work concerning market regulation should be strengthened and perfected .  
Official responsible for legislative affairs : Revision has been made in the following aspects : 1 .  To strictly guard against and severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities of printing pirated registered trademarks and forging and altering various kinds of papers , strict measures for the management of printing registered trademarks have been clearly stipulated and rules for the management of printing special papers , such as academic degree certificates , records of formal schooling and other scholastic documents , have been stipulated .  The scope of printing business of individuals has also been limited .  
Official responsible for legislative affairs : In order to effectively crack down on illegal and criminal activities in the printing industry , the new " Regulations " have emphasized that those who are engaged in the printing business must do their business according to law and have also emphasized that administrative departments must do administrative work according to law .  
In the last two years , since he was elected chairman of the Ninth NPC standing committee in 1998 , Li Peng has gained in-depth understanding of NPC work and has made considerable contributions to conducting legislative research and strengthening the rule of law in governing the country , according to the source .  His delivery of the NPC Standing Committee report to NPC deputies will help create a new situation in NPC work in the new century .  It will make NPC 's work more transparent and more oriented to society and the general public .  
On the major legislative activities at present , Zeng Jianhui said : We are mainly studying in earnest the revision of the Company Law , pushing forward the drafting of the Social Security Law , strengthening legislation in the areas of science and education , drawing up and revising laws pertaining to the financial services industry and international economic relations and trade , and paying close attention to drafting the Supervision Law .  
Therefore , it is imperative to enact a legislative law in accordance with the Constitution to institute unified regulations on the enactment of laws , ordinances and rules and regulations so that they will be more standardized and systematic in order to safeguard uniformity of the state 's legal system and establish and improve a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  This will be of great significance in advancing the rule of country in accordance with law and build a socialist country governed by law .  
The draft legislative law submitted for deliberations today , in accordance with the Constitution , provides more specific provisions regarding the basic principles to be observed in legislative work , and the respective scopes of authority , enactment procedures and applicable rules for laws , administrative laws and regulations , local ordinances , regulations on the exercise of autonomy , and special regulations .  
Third , the Basic Law is the HKSAR 's constitutional law that stipulates the various systems and policies practiced in the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems ; the system for safeguarding the residents ' fundamental rights and freedom ; the executive , legislative and judicial systems ;  
Hong Kong has kept its original way of life and social system , and continued to use the executive , legislative , and judicial systems that had proved effective .

Third , the Basic Law is the HKSAR 's constitutional law that stipulates the various systems and policies practiced in the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems ; the system for safeguarding the residents ' fundamental rights and freedom ; the executive , legislative and judicial systems ;  
Hong Kong has kept its original way of life and social system , and continued to use the executive , legislative , and judicial systems that had proved effective .  
Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .  
The circular demands that through implementing the legislation law , the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments should further standardize government legislative activities , improve the quality of government legislative work , and thus spur government legislative work to express still more comprehensively and accurately General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents , " so that government legislative work , execution of laws , and supervision of execution of laws can rise to a new level .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
This method of restricting competition disrupts the arrangement of the central authorities to coordinate all moves throughout the country as in a game of chess ; in addition to seriously hampering the normal development of the market and being unhelpful for forming a unified market , it also wrecks the integrity of state legislative , administrative , and judicial powers and weakens the proper authority of the center .  
Some people have pointed out that the new leader in Taiwan has been making a show everywhere , " talking big repeatedly " and lacking positive " policies , " that " officials all express their own different views and make frequent changes in policies , " and that the " executive yuan " and the " legislative yuan " are constantly engaged in verbal arguments .  
We must pay close attention to protecting the old people 's legal rights and privileges and vigorously strengthen legislative construction , step up law enforcement , inspection , and supervision .  We must actively launch legal system education and universal legal work to protect the old people 's legal rights and vigorously amplify the Chinese nation 's traditional virtue of respecting , providing for , and assist the old , and we must work hard to further increase every citizen 's legal awareness and moral quality toward protecting the old .  
While intensifying economic legislation , we should have a good grasp of the legislative work in terms of education , science and technology , culture , and so on with a view to creating a favorable legal environment and providing complete legal protection for developing China 's advanced culture , promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization , and carrying out the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and culture .  
Li Peng pointed out : Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , guided by the basic principle of developing the socialist democracy and amplifying the socialist legal system proposed by the party 's central committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping , China 's legislative work has scored spectacular achievements .  
In line with the party 's basic theory and basic line , the NPC and its standing committee have closely focused on economic construction , adapted themselves to the needs of reform , opening up , and modernization , and taken the legislative work as the most important task .  Apart from the passage of the current constitution and the three subsequent amendments , a large number of laws and decisions on legal issues have been made successively .  
In the meantime , the legislative work should reflect the direction of the advanced culture and , through properly grasping the legislative work in the spheres of education , science and technology , culture , and so on , create a fine legal environment for carrying forward China 's advanced culture , facilitating the building of socialist spiritual civilization , implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and education , and promoting social progress in a comprehensive way .  
During these five decades , the faculty of the Chinese People 's University Law School has positively participated in the state 's legislative and judicial building and made positive contributions to the country 's economic construction and social development , particularly to the political structural reform and the building of a democratic legal system .  
Jiang Zemin also told senior officials of the Macao SAR and the principal responsible persons of the first-term legislative and judicial organs that they shoulder the important tasks of making a good start to correctly implementing " one country , two systems " in Macao , laying a good basis for enduring peace and stability in the SAR in the future , and setting an example for their successors .  I hope that you will deal with your work with a high sense of responsibility and sense of mission and make contributions worthy of the age .  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
The basic laws were formulated by the supreme legislative organ of the country in accordance with the Constitution . They are country-wide laws embodying the guiding principle and policy of " one country , two systems . "  The status of basic laws is higher than all the other local laws in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions .  
Whether relevant laws are instrumental in combating corruption and advocating a clean government should be taken as an important part of legislative arguments .  The NPC should perfect the law on preventing and punishing corruption cases to ensure that a legally binding mechanism for exercising power according to law and preventing corruption is established to nip problems in the bud .  
- - In the area of legislative work , they carried out legislation in the light of the specific conditions and actual needs of economic and social development in their own administrative divisions , persistently making laws with local characteristics and avoiding duplicative legislation ;  
brought democracy into full play , kept to the mass line , and extensively solicited opinions before promulgating the drafts of important local laws and regulations .  Local people 's congresses with legislative power and their standing committees carried out anticipatory legislation in matters beyond the NPC and its standing committee 's exclusive legislative powers and where laws or administrative laws and regulations had yet to be drawn up , accumulating experience for the state to draw up corresponding laws .  
In the course of deliberating the work report , NPC deputies also raised positive proposals on strengthening and improving the work of the NPC Standing Committee , and called for quickening the legislative process of the supervisory work , increasing the feasibility of the supervision measures , regularizing the function of assessing the work of local government officials by local people 's congresses , further strengthening the ties between the NPC Standing Committee and local people 's congresses , encouraging and supporting local people 's congresses in making bold explorations for exercising legislative supervision .  
When attending the meeting of the Chongqing delegation , Jiang Chunyun , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , pointed out : The legislative work of the People 's Congress should be adapted to the new situation , new tasks , and new requirements .  The pace of legislation should be quickened and the quality of legislation should be enhanced so that a more effective legal guarantee can be provided for deepening reforms , expanding opening up , and quickening economic and social development .  
Buhe , vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , joined deputies of the Fujian delegation in discussing Chairman Li Peng 's work report .  He pointed out : In the next few years , we will be facing arduous legislative tasks , and the difficult points in the legislative work will be rather prominent .  We must further quicken the pace of legislation , establish and perfect the socialist legal system .  This is a fundamental measure concerning our country 's long-lasting order and stability and long-term development .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .  
At the government level , the Financial Services Bureau is responsible for ensuring that the SAR has in place an adequate and efficient policy and legislative framework conducive to a favourable and fair environment for the securities industry and to proper protection for investors .  
" As part of the territory of China , we have been authorised to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication , in accordance with our principal constitutional document , the Basic Law . "  
A set of administrative guidelines is being prepared for distribution to private and public hospitals , medical bodies and related organisations to advise those with the responsibility for transplant operations or importing of human organs intended for transplanting , of the relevant procedures and legislative requirements .  
Under the principle of " One Country , Two Systems " , the socialist system and policies are not practiced in Hong Kong , and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged .  The HKSAR enjoys executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  
On December 4 , 1998 , a Force strategy was promulgated to enhance the Force capability in handling these cases by taking prompt , proactive , preventive measures , assigning the appropriate investigative resources and maintaining a comprehensive database , and to enhance police ability in combating debt collection malpractice by pursuing legislative change .  
However , we are of the view that the CFA 's interpretation of Articles 22 and 24 of the Basic Law differs from the SAR Government 's understanding of the legislative intent of the provisions .  The CFA judgment has increased tremendously the number of people who are qualified for ROA in Hong Kong , which would impose a severe social and economic burden on Hong Kong . ExCo has decided that the Chief Executive should report to the Central Authorities and request for an interpretation of the relevant articles of the Basic Law .  
15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .  It can expound the express or implied meaning of the law only within the bounds of the legislative principle of the law in question ; it can not make any expansionist or restrictive interpretation which changes the true legislative intent , for otherwise it would be tantamount to legislative amendment .  
( ii ) The NPCSC will be able to consider our request for clarifying the true legislative intent of the relevant BL provisions at its coming meeting in June .  The following pressing problems call for swift actions to tackle them -  
( a ) clarify whether the views on BL 24 ( 2 ) , endorsed by the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR of the NPC at its fourth plenary session held on 10 August 1996 , has reflected the true legislative intent of the BL correctly and whether they have legal effect .  
In spite of strenuous efforts in implementing the CFA judgment , the implementation difficulties encountered in the past few months ; the population problems triggered by the ruling ; as well as the far-reaching impact on our society and economy have left us with no alternative but to contemplate repeatedly the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions of the Basic Law , with a view to resolving the crisis brought about by the CFA judgment .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Speaking at a business seminar in Kanazawa City of Ishikawa Prefecture , Mr Leung stressed that seeking an interpretation was not an attempt to overrule or reinterpret the CFA 's judgement , which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government ( HKSARG ) respected .  Instead , what the HKSARG had been doing was to seek a legal remedy to the problem of a potential influx of 1.67 million Mainland immigrants , and to establish the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions in the Basic Law governing the Right of Abode in Hong Kong .  
Major proposals in the legislative reforms include promulgating clear regulatory objectives for the SFC , introducing new checks and balances on the SFC , enhancing its investigatory and disciplinary powers to minimise market misconduct , streamlining of licensing regime for intermediaries to facilitate more effective regulation , and promoting quality disclosure for investors to make informed decisions .  
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .  Any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced in the context of the revision of the District Court civil procedural rules .  
Over the years , a wide range of administrative and legislative measures have been initiated and implemented through different Government bureaux and departments or NGOs to meet the diverse and changing needs of women in various areas , such as social welfare , health care , child care , retraining , etc .  
In response to a recent misleading agency report alleging that western criminals were laundering illicit money through the underground banking systems in Asian economies such as Hong Kong , the Commissioner for Narcotics , Mrs . Clarie Lo , said today ( Monday ) , " Hong Kong has all the necessary measures in place , including an ever improving legislative regime and strong enforcement actions , to counter money laundering .  
Research reveals that , in some countries such as Australia and England , there is no specific legislation on elder abuse .  They rely on other legislations to provide the necessary legislative protection but place emphasis on other measures , such as public education and enhanced training for professional and front-line staff giving care to the frail elderly , etc .  
The mental element forms a crucial basis for any prosecution action , " the spokesman explained .  " This legislative proposal aims to put forward a clear message to the market , and that is the providing of false , misleading or incomplete information to the SFC or the front-line market regulators will not be tolerated and is to be punished criminally , " he added .  
He said : " A number of the bills were not initially included in our legislative programme but circumstances had necessitated their urgent introduction .  On the other hand , preparatory action on a few other bills included in the programme is continuing .  This is because more work is involved and more time is required for consultation with interested parties and / or in preparing the relevant legislation . "  
In an opening address , Director of FEHD Mrs Rita Lau said that although there was no scientific evidence so far to suggest that GM food was inherently harmful to human health , the Government was aware that there were different views held in the society on the subject and there was the demand for legislative control and labelling of GM food so as to enable consumers to make informed choice .  
In accordance with the Basic Law , we have established the HKSAR Government and realised the principles of " One Country , Two Systems " , " Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong " and " a high degree of autonomy " .  Our lifestyle and social system remain unchanged .  The well established executive , legislative and judicial systems continue to function effectively .  Hong Kong society continues with its smooth and steady development .  
The Basic Law is the constitutional law of the HKSAR . It stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems , the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems , and the relevant policies .  
She said : " General legislative provisions can be , and indeed have to be , drafted in a precise and detailed way .  Even when frequent amendments to the provisions are required in order to accommodate the ever-changing social conditions , they will not create a profound impact on society .  However , the Basic Law is a piece of constitutional legislation which is fundamental to our society .  " Stability and foreseeability are paramount features of it , as they are of constitutions in other parts of the world .  
" The Basic Law can not be construed by adopting a narrow literal interpretation approach , its legislative intent must be considered .  Even in the common law system , there are a number of general rules governing statutory interpretation , such as littera scripta manet , ejusdem generis rule and intention of the legislation predominates and so on , " she added .

Speaking at a special meeting of the Legislative Council ( LegCo ) Panel on Security to discuss rendition , Mrs Ip noted the eventual proposal on rendition arrangement would have to be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong before it would be passed by the LegCo . She also stressed that the Mainland authorities understood and accepted the consultative and legislative procedures of the Special Administrative Region Government ( SARG ) . 
In federations , such as the United States of America , Australia and Canada , legislative power is divided between the central and regional governments .  Almost invariably , the central government is empowered to legislate on a wide range of subject matters , and the powers of regional governments are restricted .  
The Basic Law particularly provides that the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged ; the social and economic systems , the system for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems and the relevant policies shall be based on the provisions of the Basic Law .  
According to the terms of reference , the committee will review the current domestic rent policy , having regard to the evolving profile of both tenants and rental housing stock under the HA . The committee will take into account the need to reflect tenants ' affordability while ensuring public housing subsidy is given in relation to need , the existing legislative provisions of having a 10% cap on the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) after rent adjustment , and the financial performance of the Authority 's rental business .  
By Article 2 of ICESCR , all State Parties are required to take steps to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights recognised in it .  The steps to be taken include not only legislative , but also administrative , judicial , policy , economic , social and educational measures and other steps .  
In the past twelve months , the Administration introduced a number of legislative amendments aimed at enhancing road safety .  These included , inter alia , increasing the penalties for excessive speeding offences , prohibiting the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving , introducing a probationary driving licence for newly qualified motorcyclists and extending the fitting and wearing requirements of seat belts to the rear seats of taxis .  
" We have enacted the Electronic Transactions Ordinance and introduced a legislative framework for e-commerce to flourish , and established the local public key infrastructure needed for the conduct of secure electronic transactions , based on a minimalist regulatory approach . "  
In order to ensure that the pay adjustment decision , if approved , will be implemented with certainty , we propose to seek the enactment of a specific piece of legislation to cater for this year 's civil service pay adjustment .  The proposed legislative approach will provide for an express reduction of civil service pay by the specified percentages and provide that each officer 's contract shall be modified to the extent of the statutory variation .  
In addition , through relevant legislative amendment , CAD has banned all Chapter 2 wide-bodied subsonic jet aircraft as defined in Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation , which are subject to less stringent noise standards , from landing and taking off at the HKIA with effect from July 1 , 2002 .  
At the legislative level , sites and structures with outstanding historical and architectural / archaeological values are declared as monuments , and stringent statutory restrictions imposed to prohibit demolition and limit alteration .  
We will introduce legislative amendments in the middle of this year to require installation of particulate traps and catalytic converters on all pre-Euro light diesel vehicles .  The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
This situation , where the " supply " of transplant organs fails to meet " demand " , is one that concerned individuals from all walks of life have been doing their best to improve in Taiwan , aided by legislative backing . The law used to hold the position that clinical death only occurs once the respiratory and circulatory systems have ceased to function - - at which time the condition of physical organs begins to decline rapidly , limiting the possibilities for transplantation .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
In his university days , Liu Chao-neng took part in a social club at Chung-Yuan Christian University which published a magazine , and he helped organize a Logical Thinking Camp and an Environmental Living Camp . He also studied legislative procedure , joined in the student movement and demonstrated against the aging " perpetual parliamentarians " then still in office .  
Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent . According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
In 1978 , the legislative elections were canceled after the US announced it would switch diplomatic ties to the PRC . Many in the opposition camp ( represented by the newly published magazine Formosa ) favored working for change through street demonstrations , as opposed to the traditionally safer line of " reform through the system . " On December 10 , 1979 , the Kaohsiung riot occurred , and most of Formosa 's leaders were imprisoned . Democratization and the multi-party system were thus postponed .  
Saying it wants to block any rampant spread of gambling , the Executive Yuan has decided to propose additional amendments in the next legislative session . However , it will certainly meet strong opposition from the conglomerates and legislators who fought so hard to have the gambling rider passed .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
For unemployment problems of this magnitude , it is unlikely that extraordinary legislative measures will solve the problem overnight . At the end of December 2002 , the total budget was thoroughly examined . Why is n't a long-term employment bill being channeled into normal budgetary policy ? And why was a special budget suddenly rushed through ?  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
Moreover , both governing and opposition parties endorsed the ideal of a nuclear-free homeland as a long-term goal , with the executive and legislative branches reaching formal agreement on this point on October 13 , 2001 .

While reaffirming its importance for the purpose of making legislators aware of the implications of their policy choices in the field of privately financed infrastructure , the Working Group agreed that the recommendation had an educational rather than a prescriptive character and therefore was not suitable to be transformed into a model legislative provision .  
While that view attracted some support , a concern was that mentioning governmental financial or economic support in a model legislative provision would be tantamount to recommending that support be given by the Government , a result that was considered inappropriate in respect of those Governments whose policy was not to grant any support for privately financed infrastructure projects .  
Against that background , the Working Group held an extensive exchange of views on whether it would be desirable to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
Having considered the various views that were expressed , the Working Group agreed that it would be useful to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
Accordingly , it was agreed that it would be useful to draft a model legislative provision reflecting the recommendation , for the purpose of either eliminating existing legal obstacles or to overcoming possible contrary practices of judicial or administrative authorities .

Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .

If we treat only the symptoms , not the root cause , we would not only be unable to consolidate the achievements that have been made in the rectification and improvement , but also lose such achievements altogether .

Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .  
The circular demands that through implementing the legislation law , the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments should further standardize government legislative activities , improve the quality of government legislative work , and thus spur government legislative work to express still more comprehensively and accurately General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents , " so that government legislative work , execution of laws , and supervision of execution of laws can rise to a new level .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
This method of restricting competition disrupts the arrangement of the central authorities to coordinate all moves throughout the country as in a game of chess ; in addition to seriously hampering the normal development of the market and being unhelpful for forming a unified market , it also wrecks the integrity of state legislative , administrative , and judicial powers and weakens the proper authority of the center .  
Some people have pointed out that the new leader in Taiwan has been making a show everywhere , " talking big repeatedly " and lacking positive " policies , " that " officials all express their own different views and make frequent changes in policies , " and that the " executive yuan " and the " legislative yuan " are constantly engaged in verbal arguments .  
We must pay close attention to protecting the old people 's legal rights and privileges and vigorously strengthen legislative construction , step up law enforcement , inspection , and supervision .  We must actively launch legal system education and universal legal work to protect the old people 's legal rights and vigorously amplify the Chinese nation 's traditional virtue of respecting , providing for , and assist the old , and we must work hard to further increase every citizen 's legal awareness and moral quality toward protecting the old .  
While intensifying economic legislation , we should have a good grasp of the legislative work in terms of education , science and technology , culture , and so on with a view to creating a favorable legal environment and providing complete legal protection for developing China 's advanced culture , promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization , and carrying out the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and culture .  
Li Peng pointed out : Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , guided by the basic principle of developing the socialist democracy and amplifying the socialist legal system proposed by the party 's central committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping , China 's legislative work has scored spectacular achievements .  
In line with the party 's basic theory and basic line , the NPC and its standing committee have closely focused on economic construction , adapted themselves to the needs of reform , opening up , and modernization , and taken the legislative work as the most important task .  Apart from the passage of the current constitution and the three subsequent amendments , a large number of laws and decisions on legal issues have been made successively .  
In the meantime , the legislative work should reflect the direction of the advanced culture and , through properly grasping the legislative work in the spheres of education , science and technology , culture , and so on , create a fine legal environment for carrying forward China 's advanced culture , facilitating the building of socialist spiritual civilization , implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and education , and promoting social progress in a comprehensive way .  
During these five decades , the faculty of the Chinese People 's University Law School has positively participated in the state 's legislative and judicial building and made positive contributions to the country 's economic construction and social development , particularly to the political structural reform and the building of a democratic legal system .  
Jiang Zemin also told senior officials of the Macao SAR and the principal responsible persons of the first-term legislative and judicial organs that they shoulder the important tasks of making a good start to correctly implementing " one country , two systems " in Macao , laying a good basis for enduring peace and stability in the SAR in the future , and setting an example for their successors .  I hope that you will deal with your work with a high sense of responsibility and sense of mission and make contributions worthy of the age .  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
The basic laws were formulated by the supreme legislative organ of the country in accordance with the Constitution . They are country-wide laws embodying the guiding principle and policy of " one country , two systems . "  The status of basic laws is higher than all the other local laws in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions .  
Whether relevant laws are instrumental in combating corruption and advocating a clean government should be taken as an important part of legislative arguments .  The NPC should perfect the law on preventing and punishing corruption cases to ensure that a legally binding mechanism for exercising power according to law and preventing corruption is established to nip problems in the bud .  
- - In the area of legislative work , they carried out legislation in the light of the specific conditions and actual needs of economic and social development in their own administrative divisions , persistently making laws with local characteristics and avoiding duplicative legislation ;  
brought democracy into full play , kept to the mass line , and extensively solicited opinions before promulgating the drafts of important local laws and regulations .  Local people 's congresses with legislative power and their standing committees carried out anticipatory legislation in matters beyond the NPC and its standing committee 's exclusive legislative powers and where laws or administrative laws and regulations had yet to be drawn up , accumulating experience for the state to draw up corresponding laws .  
In the course of deliberating the work report , NPC deputies also raised positive proposals on strengthening and improving the work of the NPC Standing Committee , and called for quickening the legislative process of the supervisory work , increasing the feasibility of the supervision measures , regularizing the function of assessing the work of local government officials by local people 's congresses , further strengthening the ties between the NPC Standing Committee and local people 's congresses , encouraging and supporting local people 's congresses in making bold explorations for exercising legislative supervision .

He pointed out : In the next few years , we will be facing arduous legislative tasks , and the difficult points in the legislative work will be rather prominent .  We must further quicken the pace of legislation , establish and perfect the socialist legal system .  This is a fundamental measure concerning our country 's long-lasting order and stability and long-term development .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .

However , we are of the view that the CFA 's interpretation of Articles 22 and 24 of the Basic Law differs from the SAR Government 's understanding of the legislative intent of the provisions .  The CFA judgment has increased tremendously the number of people who are qualified for ROA in Hong Kong , which would impose a severe social and economic burden on Hong Kong . ExCo has decided that the Chief Executive should report to the Central Authorities and request for an interpretation of the relevant articles of the Basic Law .  
15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .  It can expound the express or implied meaning of the law only within the bounds of the legislative principle of the law in question ; it can not make any expansionist or restrictive interpretation which changes the true legislative intent , for otherwise it would be tantamount to legislative amendment .  
( ii ) The NPCSC will be able to consider our request for clarifying the true legislative intent of the relevant BL provisions at its coming meeting in June .  The following pressing problems call for swift actions to tackle them -  
( a ) clarify whether the views on BL 24 ( 2 ) , endorsed by the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR of the NPC at its fourth plenary session held on 10 August 1996 , has reflected the true legislative intent of the BL correctly and whether they have legal effect .  
In spite of strenuous efforts in implementing the CFA judgment , the implementation difficulties encountered in the past few months ; the population problems triggered by the ruling ; as well as the far-reaching impact on our society and economy have left us with no alternative but to contemplate repeatedly the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions of the Basic Law , with a view to resolving the crisis brought about by the CFA judgment .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Speaking at a business seminar in Kanazawa City of Ishikawa Prefecture , Mr Leung stressed that seeking an interpretation was not an attempt to overrule or reinterpret the CFA 's judgement , which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government ( HKSARG ) respected .  Instead , what the HKSARG had been doing was to seek a legal remedy to the problem of a potential influx of 1.67 million Mainland immigrants , and to establish the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions in the Basic Law governing the Right of Abode in Hong Kong .  
Major proposals in the legislative reforms include promulgating clear regulatory objectives for the SFC , introducing new checks and balances on the SFC , enhancing its investigatory and disciplinary powers to minimise market misconduct , streamlining of licensing regime for intermediaries to facilitate more effective regulation , and promoting quality disclosure for investors to make informed decisions .  
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .

Clarie Lo , said today ( Monday ) , " Hong Kong has all the necessary measures in place , including an ever improving legislative regime and strong enforcement actions , to counter money laundering .  
Research reveals that , in some countries such as Australia and England , there is no specific legislation on elder abuse .  They rely on other legislations to provide the necessary legislative protection but place emphasis on other measures , such as public education and enhanced training for professional and front-line staff giving care to the frail elderly , etc .  
The mental element forms a crucial basis for any prosecution action , " the spokesman explained .  " This legislative proposal aims to put forward a clear message to the market , and that is the providing of false , misleading or incomplete information to the SFC or the front-line market regulators will not be tolerated and is to be punished criminally , " he added .  
He said : " A number of the bills were not initially included in our legislative programme but circumstances had necessitated their urgent introduction .  On the other hand , preparatory action on a few other bills included in the programme is continuing .  This is because more work is involved and more time is required for consultation with interested parties and / or in preparing the relevant legislation . "  
In an opening address , Director of FEHD Mrs Rita Lau said that although there was no scientific evidence so far to suggest that GM food was inherently harmful to human health , the Government was aware that there were different views held in the society on the subject and there was the demand for legislative control and labelling of GM food so as to enable consumers to make informed choice .  
In accordance with the Basic Law , we have established the HKSAR Government and realised the principles of " One Country , Two Systems " , " Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong " and " a high degree of autonomy " .  Our lifestyle and social system remain unchanged .  The well established executive , legislative and judicial systems continue to function effectively .  Hong Kong society continues with its smooth and steady development .  
The Basic Law is the constitutional law of the HKSAR . It stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems , the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems , and the relevant policies .  
She said : " General legislative provisions can be , and indeed have to be , drafted in a precise and detailed way .  Even when frequent amendments to the provisions are required in order to accommodate the ever-changing social conditions , they will not create a profound impact on society .  However , the Basic Law is a piece of constitutional legislation which is fundamental to our society .  " Stability and foreseeability are paramount features of it , as they are of constitutions in other parts of the world .  
" The Basic Law can not be construed by adopting a narrow literal interpretation approach , its legislative intent must be considered .  Even in the common law system , there are a number of general rules governing statutory interpretation , such as littera scripta manet , ejusdem generis rule and intention of the legislation predominates and so on , " she added .

Speaking at a special meeting of the Legislative Council ( LegCo ) Panel on Security to discuss rendition , Mrs Ip noted the eventual proposal on rendition arrangement would have to be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong before it would be passed by the LegCo . She also stressed that the Mainland authorities understood and accepted the consultative and legislative procedures of the Special Administrative Region Government ( SARG ) . 
In federations , such as the United States of America , Australia and Canada , legislative power is divided between the central and regional governments .  Almost invariably , the central government is empowered to legislate on a wide range of subject matters , and the powers of regional governments are restricted .  
The Basic Law particularly provides that the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged ; the social and economic systems , the system for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems and the relevant policies shall be based on the provisions of the Basic Law .  
According to the terms of reference , the committee will review the current domestic rent policy , having regard to the evolving profile of both tenants and rental housing stock under the HA .

The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
This situation , where the " supply " of transplant organs fails to meet " demand " , is one that concerned individuals from all walks of life have been doing their best to improve in Taiwan , aided by legislative backing . The law used to hold the position that clinical death only occurs once the respiratory and circulatory systems have ceased to function - - at which time the condition of physical organs begins to decline rapidly , limiting the possibilities for transplantation .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
In his university days , Liu Chao-neng took part in a social club at Chung-Yuan Christian University which published a magazine , and he helped organize a Logical Thinking Camp and an Environmental Living Camp . He also studied legislative procedure , joined in the student movement and demonstrated against the aging " perpetual parliamentarians " then still in office .  
Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent . According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
In 1978 , the legislative elections were canceled after the US announced it would switch diplomatic ties to the PRC . Many in the opposition camp ( represented by the newly published magazine Formosa ) favored working for change through street demonstrations , as opposed to the traditionally safer line of " reform through the system . " On December 10 , 1979 , the Kaohsiung riot occurred , and most of Formosa 's leaders were imprisoned . Democratization and the multi-party system were thus postponed .  
Saying it wants to block any rampant spread of gambling , the Executive Yuan has decided to propose additional amendments in the next legislative session . However , it will certainly meet strong opposition from the conglomerates and legislators who fought so hard to have the gambling rider passed .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
For unemployment problems of this magnitude , it is unlikely that extraordinary legislative measures will solve the problem overnight . At the end of December 2002 , the total budget was thoroughly examined . Why is n't a long-term employment bill being channeled into normal budgetary policy ? And why was a special budget suddenly rushed through ?  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
Moreover , both governing and opposition parties endorsed the ideal of a nuclear-free homeland as a long-term goal , with the executive and legislative branches reaching formal agreement on this point on October 13 , 2001 . In 2002 , the Legislative Yuan formally codified a nuclear-free homeland as a strategic objective when it passed the Environmental Basic Law .

Today I am happy to be able to tell the international community that my country completed instituting its democratic republican institutions in June this year when we organized our multiparty legislative and municipal elections .  
It is to wonder how the scales of justice can operate and extend their influence when not backed up by a powerful sword if I may transpose into the international sphere the familiar thought patterns of the municipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy so dear to Montesquieu of legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
As has been pointed out on more than one occasion , the strengthening of the policy of continued economic aggression against Cuba through political pressure and various threats against sovereign Governments , which is being implemented at both the legislative and the governmental levels , in the well-known circumstances facing my country , is no mere accident , and my country has now abruptly lost more than 85 per cent of its traditional trade .  
During this year the international community has viewed with deep concern and alarm the approval by the United States Congress of legislative initiatives to move the economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba to unimaginable levels , particularly the new extraterritorial dimensions that the most conservative circles in the Congress want to give to a policy that , since its inception , has been designed to impose United States law on third States .  
On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
This position has been based on solid legal foundations that have been affirmed and reaffirmed by the General Assembly and the Security Council in numerous resolutions of which I mention in particular Security Council resolution 478 ( 1980 ) , which determines that all the legislative and administrative measures adopted by Israel with the aim of annexing or altering the character and status of the Holy City are null and void .  
We have drawn this issue to the attention of the Security Council , and we are confident that as a result urgent action at the national , regional and international levels will be taken to promote legislative harmonization and cooperation in the judicial , police and even intelligence spheres , in order to halt this insidious manifestation of terror .  
First , it would be very useful if each committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of an international human rights instrument , in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights and the necessary experts , issued a document specifying , on the one hand , those legislative norms which were contrary to the provisions of the instrument in question and , on the other hand , those which were most conducive to its implementation at the national level .

For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
In the absence of specialized theoretical and practical knowledge , and in view of the difficulties faced in obtaining such knowledge , as well as the results of the experience accumulated in other countries , the elaboration of strategies and their implementation through legislative and regulatory measures are daunting tasks for many countries , particularly developing countries and those with economies in transition .
