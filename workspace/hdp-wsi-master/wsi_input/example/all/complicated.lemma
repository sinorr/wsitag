Upon joining the missile company , Li Bin , with an education level of junior middle school only , felt completely at a loss when he faced all kinds of complicated pictures about structure of missiles , theories of constructing missiles , original elements of electrical equipment , and the dazzling red , blue , and green buttons of missile launching .  
In line with the major central plans for launching antismuggling joint action and special struggles , they have exposed and handled a number of complicated cases which have caused very bad influences .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
and the foundation of unity and stability has been further strengthened .  At the same time , with the continual deepening of reform and opening , there have emerged diverse economic elements and economic interests as well as diverse lifestyles and organizational forms in society , resulting in new changes in the economic structure and social relationships .  As a result , we are faced with many complicated issues entailing both benefits and harms and have encountered many tough and difficult contradictions .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .  With the exception of an extremely small number of complicated diseases that need more researches and studies to overcome them , common diseases can be cured by proper treatment .  
Under this circumstance , how do we prevent the United Nations from being swept to one side again ; how do we make the relations between big nations remain " unbroken amid fighting " ; and how do we conduct peacekeeping missions , under the auspices or with the approval of this major international organization , in a more cautious manner and on a more rationale scale , are " complicated arts " that need to be studied .  
The conferences conscientiously reviewed and summed up the work practice and main experience of the people of our country in prevailing over difficulties and overcoming risks under a complicated domestic and international environment and in continuing to advance the cause of reform , opening , and socialist modernization construction , and the two conferences also planned and assigned important work tasks for the country for the last year of this century .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : Both China and Vietnam are socialist countries under the leadership of the communist party .  In the face of the present complicated and changeable international situation , we two countries should seize the current favorable opportunity , meet the challenges head-on , step up cooperation , and strive for common development .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
We soon had an interview with Che Guevara , and obtained a lot of inside information from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , head of the daily newspaper Hoy . Confined by objective historical conditions and delicate and complicated international relations , however , we found that many of the questions could not be reported openly .  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
Then we should build corresponding mathematical models and set up information-linkage relations among them .  In this way , it will be easy for us to carry out a systematic analysis on as well as a demonstration and proof of complicated commanding problems .  It is also helpful to form connecting ties between various links so as to meet the requirement of stability in command and control .  
The achievements of the " Ninth 5-Year Plan " have been attained on the basis of the rapid developments of reform and opening up , which are not easily won .  They can fully demonstrate the super leading part of the Party 's third generation collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in mastering the overall macroscopic situation , handling various complicated situations , and leading the people of the whole country to advance in a pioneering spirit .  
Over the last five years , in the face of all difficulties arising in the very complicated internal and external environments and economic ad social life , we have always regarded speeding up development as a basic guiding ideology in the economic work , upheld employing methods of development to revolve issues in our forging ahead , adopted a series of policies and measures to promote economic developments , and maintained relatively fast speed developments . 
Meanwhile , the current international situation remains relatively complicated .  While peace and development are the main themes at present , hegemonism and power politics still exist .  The unfair and unreasonable international economic order is still playing its role , and the wealth gap between developing and developed countries keeps widening .  
When we are exultant at the great achievements made in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and review the extraordinary course traversed by the people in the whole country under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we deeply feel that the party central leading body indeed has the superb ability to bring the overall situation under control and apply regulatory mechanisms to scientifically handle complicated situations while exercising leadership , and this was the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
Under the " Ninth Five-year Plan " in particular , despite the complicated domestic and international situations , China 's national economy still sustained rapid and healthy development ; the GDP grew at an average rate of 8 percent a year , and it is estimated that the year 2000 ' s GDP will top more than 8.7-trillion yuan , or more than $ 1-trillion at today 's exchange rate .  
Only by comprehensively improving the tactical technological performance of the network of fire according to the needs of operation so that it will remain in perfect shape under various complicated circumstances of the battlefield before it can give full play to its potential in an actual operation and can it really become an " unbeatable rival " of missiles .  
Compared to the rather complicated and profound changes of last year , the international situation this year has been relatively stable with no major collisions .  What is particularly conspicuous is the fact that various countries have been making adjustments to their internal and external policies that are oriented to the new century .  
The world is still not free from disturbance .  In face of the complicated situation in which international relations are undergoing profound adjustments , opportunities and challenges coexist , political parties of all countries , including the ruling , participating , and opposition parties , are keeping eyes on the 21st century in a bid to explore a development strategy that better fits the trend of the times and their respective reality .  
At the same time , understanding and mastering these laws is a process where subjective and objective factors converge .  In reality , this convergence frequently has experienced the interference and impact of various factors .  That is why mastering the laws of the building of socialism takes repeated exploration and experimentation and is a historical process that is sure to be prolonged and complicated .  
In the current international circumstances which are undergoing profound changes , while concentrating our strength on advancing the modernization drive and continuing to open up to the outside world , we must keep ourselves sober-headed against the infiltration of the Western ideology .  An important thing we should do is to persistently apply the dialectical materialist and historical materialist point of view to observe the complicated social phenomena .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
Faced with the extremely sharp and complicated international struggle , in the past 10-plus years , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core judged the hour and sized up the situation , took the initiative , maneuvered among various states , and defeated western hostile forces ' attempts to disturb us .  Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
We should help our cadres raise their political ability in appraising things , maintain a sober mind in the face of a complicated situation , and be bold and courageous while be prudent like standing on the edge of a cliff or ice .  
Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .  
Facing the complex and complicated international and domestic environments , the vast number of officers and soldiers in the whole army have always affirmed their faith in Marxism , their conviction in socialism , their confidence in the reform and opening up and the modernization drive , and their trust in the party and the government .  They have further strengthened the concept of absolute leadership of the party over the army and more consciously maintained uniformity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Although overseas media vied with one another in carrying " disclosures " on issues such as when Xu Junping defected , what post he assumed in the military , what were the motives for his defection , and what impact his defection would have on the Chinese Communist military , no conclusion had even been drawn .  Moreover , there were even many contradictory stories circulating around , making the already mysterious and unpredictable case more complicated and confusing .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
Law Suk-ching , a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC , said : By allowing the US crew to leave China , China has based itself on a humanitarian stance , taken the overall situation into consideration , been devoted to maintaining long-term China-US relations , and safeguarded China 's major task of reform , opening up , and economic construction .  All this has shown China 's diplomatic skills in proficiently handling complicated international issues .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
Zhu Feng : The Chinese government has all along assigned importance to and treasured the stability and constructive development of Sino-US relations .  Sustained intervention by the United States on China 's human rights condition in this process has hurt the friendly feelings of the Chinese people .  It has also widened the scope of disputes between the two countries and artificially complicated and sharpened bilateral relations .  
Those ranked at the second level are chivalrous experts .  They are the " middle-aged mainstay " in the world of hackers .  They are mature and stable in terms of their technological standard , and capable of independently handling more complicated situations .  Moreover , since they are the ones who give demonstrations and guidance to novices , they are considered the " high production units " in the operation .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
Over the past few years , our country 's social order situation has witnessed some new situations and new problems owing to some complicated social factors , and also because the leaders in some regions have laid one-sided emphasis on economic growth but neglected the work of maintaining social order and a legal system , and this has become a major contributing factor .  
The armed helicopters conceal themselves by using complicated weather conditions , and make a sudden attack by conducting low-altitude flights and hedgehopping .  The armed helicopters land behind the " enemy " lines , and transport special task forces to press straight on the important target when conducting sabotage operations behind the enemy lines .  This kind of sudden attack is commonly seen in modern warfare , and is called figuratively as the " surgical operation " on the combat field .  
We must fully understand the protracted , arduous and complicated nature of pollution management and environmental improvement , and maintain healthy , stable and sustainable economic growth in our region .  A the same time , we must make efforts to do a good job at environmental protection .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another . 
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
In an editorial on 7 June , the China Times pointed out structural factors behind the island 's current economic malaise .  If the root cause of the problems is not dealt with and if overhasty actions are adopted , the paper stated , economic problems would only be made even more complicated and intractable .  
During flight training , the regiment ordered its personnel to train on a number of applied tactical topics under complicated meteorological conditions , trained its pilots in terms of will and endurance to the maximum extent , and assigned its pilots to fulfill during one flight combat missions that had previously taken two flights to accomplish , thus enhancing its pilots ' continuous fighting capabilities by a large margin .  
The brigade 's new equipment is technology intensive and requires complicated operations .  In connection with this reality , the brigade made the training of a contingent of personnel capable of tackling key scientific and technological problems a core issue in resolving training problems and the improvement of quality and performance an important way to shortening the cycle for transforming new equipment into combat strength .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
In the face of a drastic change in the world 's pattern , as well as heavy and arduous reform tasks , our party judged the hour and sized up the situation , made wise policy decisions , eliminated all kinds of interference , properly handled a series of major and complicated issues , withstood the buffet caused by the Asian financial crisis , overcame the historically unprecedented floods , and succeeded in maintaining a sustained , rapid and sound economic development .  
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
Faced with complicated and dynamic international situations and domestic situations which are rapidly changing , some particularly significant unexpected issues over the past years , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , took a broad and long-term view of issues , devised strategies in a confident manner , and handled expected and sudden issues in a confident and calm manner , which embodied extraordinary leadership skills and the ability to handle complicated situations .  
Although the external environment for exports in China 's foreign trade in the second half of the year may become even more complicated , we should notice that the international market is still expanding and there is still room and huge potential for the country and different localities to increase exports .  To reach the 8 percent growth set for the year 's exports is completely possible if hard efforts are exerted .  
Through a special form of redemption , that is , the paying of fixed interest to original owners of the private businesses , the most complicated task in our country 's socialist transformation was smoothly and stably accomplished .  
Under the conditions of socialism , reform is carried out in a peaceful and orderly form , it does not only resolve some minor problems , but is directed at the old economic structure as a whole .  Therefore it is arduous and complicated , and inevitably produces a strong impact that shocks society in may aspects .  
successfully maintained a sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; and has brought about a comprehensive progress in society .  Meanwhile , our party has successfully removed all kinds of interruptions , properly handled a series of major and complicated issues both at home and abroad , resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics , effectively maintained the stability of our society , defended the state sovereignty and the national dignity of our country , and made positive contribution to world peace and development .  
and the party 's leading collective of the third generation has the extraordinary political wisdom and the superb capability to keep a complicated situation under control , and is a firm leading collective that leads the whole party and the people of the entire country to constantly push forward the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
When facing the complicated international situation marked by the confrontation between the Eastern and the Western camps , the leaders of new China represented by Mao Zedong , proceeding from the fundamental interests of our country , adopted the foreign policy of " totally leaning to " the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union .  
Despite the fact that the current situation at home and abroad is favorable to us , we must soberly realize that China is developing its modernization program in a more complicated international environment .  Right now , the world is undergoing profound changes .  It is becoming more and more multi-polarized , and continuously marching toward economic globalization .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
Through extensive investigation , the unit concerned discovered from information obtained that the Chinese communists are in the process of drawing up a complicated plan for conducting united front work among Taiwan troops , and the case is an experiment to test how well Officer Liu can assimilate into the PLA and whether their plan to form a united front with our national armed forces is feasible .  
Thus far , pilots of this flight squadron have independently fulfilled the highly difficult tasks of two planes flying parallel at night , landing under the guidance of airport lights , and flying at night in extremely complicated weather .  As a result , the night flexible operation capacity of this squadron has been enhanced greatly .  
The exceptionally large smuggling case recently cracked in Xiamen is among the worst smuggling cases ever handled ever since the founding of New China , for it involved an immense amount of money , showed complicated details , did severe harm to society , and left extremely bad impressions ; and the problems exposed in the case have proved a shock to the public .  
Reform is being carried out under the complicated environment at home and abroad .  It is faced with the interference and sabotage of the hostile forces .  This demands that we further enhance our political awareness , adopt a firm and clear-cut stand in our major political struggles , and resolutely safeguard the Party 's leadership and the socialist system .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
the strong central leadership which is experienced and can have various complicated situations well in hand ; the correct line focusing on economic construction ; and the successful experience of handling well the relationship between reform on the one hand and development and stability on the other and of maintaining social stability , we are fully confident that our state will make further progress and our nation will prosper .  
It is impossible to successfully organize such a colossal and complicated support by relying on the army 's logistic department alone .  The only way to meet the operational needs is to rely on the economic strength of the state as a whole to blend operational logistics support into the " vast logistics " for society to effect an army-civilian integral support .  
By using force against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia , US-led NATO had not only seriously violated the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law and set an extremely dangerous example of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries , but had also further complicated the situation in the region .  
Over the past year , CPC disciplinary-enforcement and law-enforcement organs at all levels exposed , investigated , and took actions against a number of major cases characterized by high-ranking officials , huge amounts of money , large numbers of people involved , hidden methods of crime , complicated situations , and rather vicious effects on public perceptions ;  
The Chinese Government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .  
Zhou Tianyong also believed that while China has attained tremendous achievements in its economic development in recent years , a number of deep-seated contradictions have gradually manifested themselves .  Nevertheless , thanks to its timely major readjustments in many fields , China has been able to meet the various indexes set for its national economic reform , development , and stability under an extremely complicated situation both inside and outside the country .  
In the face of the complicated Middle East situation , China always has maintained that the countries concerned should truly implement the relevant UN resolution and abide by the principle of " exchanging land for peace . "  In accordance with the spirit of respecting history , facing reality and having their eyes on the future , they should conduct peace talks in an unremitting , flexible and pragmatic way so that the long-drawn-out Middle East problem can be resolved in an all-round , just and thorough way .  
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .

When elucidating the human rights situation of the motherland of China , it is very correct to emphasize that the right to survive is fundamental .  However , explaining " democracy and human rights " to the Taiwan compatriots is even more complicated , and is also very difficult to manage .  But , this is possibly much more powerful than guided missiles , so it is worth striving to try to do .  
At the turn of the century , when the international situation is complicated and ever changing , strengthening and developing Sino-DPRK friendly relations not only is in line with the common wish and fundamental interests of the people of the two countries , but also is conducive to peace and stability in this region as well as of the world .  
At the Sino-DPRK summit , leaders of the two countries unanimously held that at the turn of the century when the international situation is complicated and ever-changing , consolidating and developing Sino-DPRK friendly relations is not only in accord with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the people of the two countries but also beneficial to peace and stability in the region and the world as well .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
We should build a corps of high-quality cadres who should be politically firm and who are able to cope with all kinds of dangers and are skillful in dealing with complicated situations .  All these are for the purpose of enabling our party to meet challenges , grasp the opportunity , gain the initiative , bring about development , and gain a favorable strategic position in the 21st century .  
Today , faced with complicated and profound changes in the international situation , in order to safeguard world peace and stability , the principle of respect for a country 's sovereignty , the principle of non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and various other principles must be further strengthened rather than weakened .  Li Peng 's remarks have attested to China 's stand of upholding justice and fairness in international affairs .  
Over the past year , facing the complicated and ever-changing international situation and fierce international competition , the company , while having straightened out its internal relationships and striving to enable its new system to work effectively , has continued to raise the level of astronautical development and applied itself to improving quality , enabling it to successfully launch satellites and to test fly large astronautical vehicles .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
Chen Zhili stressed : While fully affirming our achievements , we must soberly notice that there are still quite pronounced problems facing party building and ideological and political work in colleges and universities and that we are faced with a more complicated situation , heavier tasks , and more arduous work ahead .  
In the face of a complicated and changing post-Cold War international situation , the two countries share broad consensus in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries , and in building a new international political and economic order that is just and rational . 
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
It is a complicated and long-term task to correctly appraise the social situation and the will of the people .  The SAR Government and all people loving the country and Hong Kong must build firm confidence .  The principle of " one country , two systems " has enjoyed abundant popular support and stands a very good chance of success .  The chief executive and the SAR Government have done substantial and effective work .  Local economic discovery is under way .  Our society is now stable and united .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .  
Under the complicated situation , we have been able to make a correct assessment of the situation , deal with the problems calmly , pursue what is favorable and steer clear of what is unfavorable to us .  In so doing , we have not only successfully brought inflation under control and achieved a " soft landing " for our economy , but have effectively enlarged demand , injected new vitality to economic development , and ensured the smooth implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
General Secretary Jiang 's important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , from a higher starting point , with a broader vision , and in a deeper sense , has brought to light the profound historical background , complicated social environment , and many other formidable challenges facing ideological and political work , and has raised our understanding of the life-line position of ideological and political work to the new height .  
In particular , in the complicated and changeable international situation and with the increasingly strained cross-strait relations , the CPC must speed up its modernization on the one hand and make preparations to " meet emergencies " on the other , in order to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to ensure that its independent foreign policy is preserved .  
Remarkable changes have been noticed in the ideological thinking , discipline , and work style of the country 's police contingent ; the unifying force and the competitive effectiveness of the contingent have both been enhanced on a constant basis ; and the vast numbers of public security personnel and police officers have stood the test of severe and complicated struggles , and have made outstanding contribution to safeguarding the state security , to ensuring a sound social and political stability , and to maintaining a stable public order .  
In view of the complicated and arduous nature of the reforms of the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the medical and health system and the fact that the two reforms must be well-coordinated and carried out simultaneously , every province , autonomous region and city must assign one leading comrade to take charge of this work , coordinate all quarters concerned and promptly work out solutions to major contradictions and problems encountered in the course of reform .

Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
We should help our cadres raise their political ability in appraising things , maintain a sober mind in the face of a complicated situation , and be bold and courageous while be prudent like standing on the edge of a cliff or ice .  
Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .  
Facing the complex and complicated international and domestic environments , the vast number of officers and soldiers in the whole army have always affirmed their faith in Marxism , their conviction in socialism , their confidence in the reform and opening up and the modernization drive , and their trust in the party and the government .  They have further strengthened the concept of absolute leadership of the party over the army and more consciously maintained uniformity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Although overseas media vied with one another in carrying " disclosures " on issues such as when Xu Junping defected , what post he assumed in the military , what were the motives for his defection , and what impact his defection would have on the Chinese Communist military , no conclusion had even been drawn .  Moreover , there were even many contradictory stories circulating around , making the already mysterious and unpredictable case more complicated and confusing .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
Law Suk-ching , a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC , said : By allowing the US crew to leave China , China has based itself on a humanitarian stance , taken the overall situation into consideration , been devoted to maintaining long-term China-US relations , and safeguarded China 's major task of reform , opening up , and economic construction .  All this has shown China 's diplomatic skills in proficiently handling complicated international issues .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
Zhu Feng : The Chinese government has all along assigned importance to and treasured the stability and constructive development of Sino-US relations .  Sustained intervention by the United States on China 's human rights condition in this process has hurt the friendly feelings of the Chinese people .  It has also widened the scope of disputes between the two countries and artificially complicated and sharpened bilateral relations .  
Those ranked at the second level are chivalrous experts .  They are the " middle-aged mainstay " in the world of hackers .  They are mature and stable in terms of their technological standard , and capable of independently handling more complicated situations .  Moreover , since they are the ones who give demonstrations and guidance to novices , they are considered the " high production units " in the operation .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
Over the past few years , our country 's social order situation has witnessed some new situations and new problems owing to some complicated social factors , and also because the leaders in some regions have laid one-sided emphasis on economic growth but neglected the work of maintaining social order and a legal system , and this has become a major contributing factor .  
The armed helicopters conceal themselves by using complicated weather conditions , and make a sudden attack by conducting low-altitude flights and hedgehopping .  The armed helicopters land behind the " enemy " lines , and transport special task forces to press straight on the important target when conducting sabotage operations behind the enemy lines .  This kind of sudden attack is commonly seen in modern warfare , and is called figuratively as the " surgical operation " on the combat field .  
We must fully understand the protracted , arduous and complicated nature of pollution management and environmental improvement , and maintain healthy , stable and sustainable economic growth in our region .  A the same time , we must make efforts to do a good job at environmental protection .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another . 
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
In an editorial on 7 June , the China Times pointed out structural factors behind the island 's current economic malaise .  If the root cause of the problems is not dealt with and if overhasty actions are adopted , the paper stated , economic problems would only be made even more complicated and intractable .  
During flight training , the regiment ordered its personnel to train on a number of applied tactical topics under complicated meteorological conditions , trained its pilots in terms of will and endurance to the maximum extent , and assigned its pilots to fulfill during one flight combat missions that had previously taken two flights to accomplish , thus enhancing its pilots ' continuous fighting capabilities by a large margin .  
The brigade 's new equipment is technology intensive and requires complicated operations .  In connection with this reality , the brigade made the training of a contingent of personnel capable of tackling key scientific and technological problems a core issue in resolving training problems and the improvement of quality and performance an important way to shortening the cycle for transforming new equipment into combat strength .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
In the face of a drastic change in the world 's pattern , as well as heavy and arduous reform tasks , our party judged the hour and sized up the situation , made wise policy decisions , eliminated all kinds of interference , properly handled a series of major and complicated issues , withstood the buffet caused by the Asian financial crisis , overcame the historically unprecedented floods , and succeeded in maintaining a sustained , rapid and sound economic development .  
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
Faced with complicated and dynamic international situations and domestic situations which are rapidly changing , some particularly significant unexpected issues over the past years , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , took a broad and long-term view of issues , devised strategies in a confident manner , and handled expected and sudden issues in a confident and calm manner , which embodied extraordinary leadership skills and the ability to handle complicated situations .  
Although the external environment for exports in China 's foreign trade in the second half of the year may become even more complicated , we should notice that the international market is still expanding and there is still room and huge potential for the country and different localities to increase exports .  To reach the 8 percent growth set for the year 's exports is completely possible if hard efforts are exerted .  
Through a special form of redemption , that is , the paying of fixed interest to original owners of the private businesses , the most complicated task in our country 's socialist transformation was smoothly and stably accomplished .  
Under the conditions of socialism , reform is carried out in a peaceful and orderly form , it does not only resolve some minor problems , but is directed at the old economic structure as a whole .  Therefore it is arduous and complicated , and inevitably produces a strong impact that shocks society in may aspects .

Meanwhile , our party has successfully removed all kinds of interruptions , properly handled a series of major and complicated issues both at home and abroad , resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics , effectively maintained the stability of our society , defended the state sovereignty and the national dignity of our country , and made positive contribution to world peace and development .  
and the party 's leading collective of the third generation has the extraordinary political wisdom and the superb capability to keep a complicated situation under control , and is a firm leading collective that leads the whole party and the people of the entire country to constantly push forward the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
When facing the complicated international situation marked by the confrontation between the Eastern and the Western camps , the leaders of new China represented by Mao Zedong , proceeding from the fundamental interests of our country , adopted the foreign policy of " totally leaning to " the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union .  
Despite the fact that the current situation at home and abroad is favorable to us , we must soberly realize that China is developing its modernization program in a more complicated international environment .  Right now , the world is undergoing profound changes .  It is becoming more and more multi-polarized , and continuously marching toward economic globalization .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
Through extensive investigation , the unit concerned discovered from information obtained that the Chinese communists are in the process of drawing up a complicated plan for conducting united front work among Taiwan troops , and the case is an experiment to test how well Officer Liu can assimilate into the PLA and whether their plan to form a united front with our national armed forces is feasible .  
Thus far , pilots of this flight squadron have independently fulfilled the highly difficult tasks of two planes flying parallel at night , landing under the guidance of airport lights , and flying at night in extremely complicated weather .  As a result , the night flexible operation capacity of this squadron has been enhanced greatly .  
The exceptionally large smuggling case recently cracked in Xiamen is among the worst smuggling cases ever handled ever since the founding of New China , for it involved an immense amount of money , showed complicated details , did severe harm to society , and left extremely bad impressions ; and the problems exposed in the case have proved a shock to the public .  
Reform is being carried out under the complicated environment at home and abroad .  It is faced with the interference and sabotage of the hostile forces .  This demands that we further enhance our political awareness , adopt a firm and clear-cut stand in our major political struggles , and resolutely safeguard the Party 's leadership and the socialist system .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
the strong central leadership which is experienced and can have various complicated situations well in hand ; the correct line focusing on economic construction ; and the successful experience of handling well the relationship between reform on the one hand and development and stability on the other and of maintaining social stability , we are fully confident that our state will make further progress and our nation will prosper .  
It is impossible to successfully organize such a colossal and complicated support by relying on the army 's logistic department alone .  The only way to meet the operational needs is to rely on the economic strength of the state as a whole to blend operational logistics support into the " vast logistics " for society to effect an army-civilian integral support .

The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .
