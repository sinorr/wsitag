Pop queen Madonna 's upcoming spiritual tour to Israel to study a mysterious Jewish philosophy has raised questions over her true faith .  Does the self-proclaimed material girl really have faith in the traditional ancient Jewish mysticism or is this simply the latest fashion of self-help for celebrities .  
After the spring term begins , all middle and primary schools , education administrative departments and relevant organizations should publicize the government 's educational policy and the correct educational thinking and methods to the parents , exchange with them or introduce to them the experience of educating children scientifically , guide them to take a correct attitude toward education and know the true meaning of talent , and guide their eagerness to see their children succeed in life to the right direction .  
Without concentrating our energy , we can neither accelerate development nor bring true its advancedment and since the productive forces of our country never experienced a full development under capitalist conditions , we must complete , under socialist conditions , the task of industrialization and economic socialization , marketization , and modernization which advanced countries will complete under capitalist conditions .  
6 .  Find Market Prestige Through Quality After-Sales Service Household electrical appliances are expensive durable consumer goods ; only part of an appliance is sold when it leaves a store , as a sale in its true meaning is completed only when it is fully installed and fit for safe usage .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
When the training entered the stage of camouflage concentration target confrontation , offices and soldiers of the " red army " set up concentration targets , such as real and false artillery positions , missile positions , and field airports using camouflage to make true targets invisible while leaving false targets exposed , such as shaped defilade , smoke screen , and false target .  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
In consumption , last year 84-million medium and low-wage townsfolk increased their income , bank interest was reduced , tax on interest was levied , and the system of true names for deposits was put into effect , festival holidays were extended , and other policies for stimulating consumption were put into effect ; all this played a role in encouraging people , with the result that social consumption changed out of the slackness of the previous two years .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
We should learn from his noble character of selflessness , with which he has become a model of virtue for others , realized the true value of his life through making selfless dedications , and has retained the true political color of a communist party member .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
They are used to social entertainment , talking in a flamboyant manner and even employ trickery and conceal the true state of affairs from their supervisors and subordinates .  These negative working styles have damaged the Party 's image , contaminated Party conduct and hurt the enthusiasm of the masses .  This has been extremely harmful to the Party 's causes .  
Sinking into the mire deeper and deeper , they were finally devoid of all senses and lost self-control .  It is true that Li Hongzhi and his like are cunning and their fallacies are quite deceitful , but the tragic end of some " Falungong " infatuates could not be separated from their ignorance and a lack of a correct world outlook and a correct outlook on life .  
Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
Our military 's current budget-making method was based on the planned economy .  It is true that this method has played a positive role in ensuringassuring the all aspects of military in every construction , but this method has such problems , such as being too general in contents , not being transparent and being too weak to bein binding .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
China has cracked down on " Falungong " according to the law , exposed Li Hongzhi 's deception , cut off the murdering paws of the cults , made most " Falungong " practitioners see through the true nature of the cult and enabled them to return to normal life , rescued those fanatic practitioners who fell into the trap set up by the cult , and helped avoid the occurrence of human tragedy .  
The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
This indicates that what he said one year ago about not pursuing " Taiwan independence " was just a forced move to which he had no alternative , and as soon as he held that he had firm footing , or had a certain support from foreign forces , he showed his true features .  
It is true that the party , before long after its establishment , realized that , in light of the Chinese real situation of a semicolonial and semi-feudalistic society , the party should give priority to toppling imperialist and feudalistic forces over the immediate establishment of a socialist society not to mention a communist society , a task for far ahead in the future .  
In order to meet the needs of modern warfare , and make sure that the unit will master the true skills of being " prompt in mobilization , prompt in operations , prompt in coordination , and worthy of performance assessments , " the unit established a small group for training soldiers with science and technology in 2000 .  The small group , composed of key elements of all departments , has conducted active explorations by focusing on the topic of " emergency mobilization of non-motorized radar . "  
Internet media should adopt a serious and responsible attitude and build a whole set of standard systems for posting news and information and guarding the door , and practice strict self-discipline , so as to provide true and accurate news and information for society , establish public trustworthiness , and build a good social image of Internet media .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .  
You have been fulfilling the general demand of Chairman Jiang 's " five phrases " , meeting high standards , and completely improving the quality of the troops bearing in mind the historical mission of " fighting to win " and " maintaining the true qualities , " thus outstandingly accomplishing all tasks bestowed on you by the people , forging the veteran Tibetan spirit of " being particularly able to bear hardship , to fight , to endure , to remain united , and to dedicate yourselves , " and producing large numbers of advanced role models .  
This horrifying incident and brutal tragedy has once again thoroughly unmasked the ugly face of Li Hongzhi and his so called " the true , the good , and the tolerant , " and has further laid bare to the world the ugly and inhumane nature of the " Falungong " as an evil cult that harms life .  
You have always maintained the true political qualities of being loyal to the party , to the country , to the people and to socialism .  You have resolutely waged struggles against western hostile forces and the national splittists , won great victories in suppressing rebels and bandits and in the self-defense counterattack , forcefully maintained border and social stability in Tibet , and defended our state sovereignty , territorial integrity and national unity .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
We should learn from them their true political qualities of carrying forward and developing the glorious traditions of our party and our army , consciously resisting temptations , firmly holding the defense line , and always " resisting and keeping away from corrosive influences . "  We should learn from them their up-to-the-mark work style of running the inspection post strictly , ensuring a strict enforcement of the law , stressing on decorum , and observing discipline .  
It goes without saying that our foreign policy should be a steady one , and we should conceal our true features and gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck .  However , Japanese authorities have behaved with unbearable insolence for a long time ; their unfriendly attitude towards China has been clearly showed by a series of incidents , such as the Diaoyutai incident , the incident of altering textbooks , the incident of paying homage to Yasukuni Shrine , and the incident of imposing punitive tariffs on imported Chinese farm products .  
We have gathered a lot of female " Falungong " practitioners who disturbed social order and through our help , most of them have realized Li Hongzhi 's true colors and " Falungong 's " evil nature .  Consequently , Masanjia Reeducation Center has become the most prominent target that has been attacked and slandered by Li Hongzhi and his gang .  
The Soviet Union was all along reticent about the true figures of its military spending .  The total amount of its defense expenditures , published for the first time in 1989 , was 77.3 billion rubles .  It was further admitted in 1990 that its military spending represented one-fourth of its national budget .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .  
In facing the complex situation before them , we hope that Taiwan 's leaders will deeply consider the true and the false , and set a beneficial policy , under the principle of one China , and with the two sides of the Strait as its center , with the people as its center , to promote a constructive trust and peaceful stability as the way forward , instead of a conflict creating a new potential conflict .

In fact , the United States has never intended to make Taiwan an " independent " country in the true sense of the word .  Taiwan is a mere pawn on the US strategic chessboard and an " unsinkable aircraft carrier " deployed in the Far East Pacific region by the United States . Whether the United States will retain or abandon this pawn is determined not by its consideration of Taiwan people 's interests but solely by the consideration of its own national interests .  
It is true that the new Taiwan leader purposely and very nicely packaged " Taiwan independence " theories and did not specifically mention " Taiwan independence " at all .  However , the main theme of " Taiwan independence " permeated the whole speech .  He particularly stressed the " democratic and equal " status between " Taiwan " and " China , " purposely severed the connections between Taiwan and mother mainland , and words and sentences about splittist concepts and separatism were abundant .  
As may be seen from Chen Shuibian 's [ Ch'en Shui-pian ] inaugural speech on 20 May , this " minority leader " who took power with 39 percent of the popular vote is still hard-pressed to promote " Taiwan Independence " at present .  Under domestic and international pressure , he has forged compromises with all sides , and his government is presented with pretty wording and an academic wrapping .  However , all these are unable to conceal the consistently true nature of things .  
At this summit , both Kim Chong-il and Kim Yong Nam have emphatically stressed the importance of " independence and reunification " ; and have pointed out that since " foreign countries are not happy to see a united Korean Peninsula to become a strong country " and will surely place various kinds of obstacles to hinder reunification , the Korean nation must rely on its own strength , independently resolve the nation 's internal contradictions , and bring true the country 's grand cause of reunification .  
Minister of Public Security , Jia Chunwang , spoke at the meeting .  He said : Liu Jinguo 's advanced deeds embody the firm faith of a communist and demonstrate the true color of a public functionary as well as the loyalty and dauntlessness of people 's police .  He is an outstanding representative of so many heroic models of public security organs across the country .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .  
Associate Professor Liu Guoshen said : Mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors seem like the first light of the day in the current critical cross-strait relations .  These visits , serving as an opportunity for both sides of the strait to advance toward mutual trust and reconciliation , can not come true because of obstructions by the Taiwan side under " all sorts of pretexts . "  This is regrettable .  
Second , we should earnestly make the administrative activities open to the masses and let them know about the situation and exercise supervision , and also strengthen the internal supervisory and binding mechanism of the administrative organs so as to ensure that the contents made public are true , fair , and trustworthy .  
The rapid development of the Internet has played an important role in bringing about world economic growth and the strengthening of contacts among the people of various countries .  However , we must realize that there exist some problems regarding the Internet that make people worried : There is an overflow of junk information that is anti-science , pseudo-science , unhealthy or even very harmful .  Some people intentionally publish information that does not conform to the truth to mislead people 's understanding about the true situation .  
Their struggle would also bring endless disasters to humankind .  If , on the other hand , these two poles become true " constructive strategic partners " and join hands in safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world with concerted efforts , the 21st century will have lasting peace and become the most peaceful century in modern history .  This will be the two countries ' greatest contributions to all humankind .  
This responsible person noted that ever since the true features the " Falungong " as a religious cult were revealed , over 98 percent of the " Falungong " practitioners have seen the error of their ways and are determined to make a clean break with their past .  Today , they have successfully extricated themselves from Li Hongzhi 's spiritual control , and are leading a normal life .  
However , their moves met with strong opposition from the local overseas Chinese students , ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese nationals , who wrote to the press , denouncing their perverse and evil preaching and exposing their tricks in hoodwinking the public as well as the despicable deeds of the " Falungong " members who robbed people in the streets because they were possessed by the devil , thus laying bear the true features of the " Falungong " as a cult .  
Although the story might not be true , the idea expressed by the story really calls for deep thought .  The reason why our country , a country with a civilization of 5,000 years , has not declined despite tribulation but has risen in high spirit despite repeated adversity is that it has many broad and profound ideas and has a powerful intrinsic cohesive force .  
According to an informed source , the tragedy of building collapse in Houjie , Dongguan , has aroused great attention of the central authorities .  The fact that relevant departments in Dongguan concealed the true death toll on purpose for several days in a row has drawn the ire of Beijing authorities .  The Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Public Security have dispatched an investigation group to Dongguan to learn about the truth of the incident through non-governmental channels .  
We advise those " Falungong " members who have not yet come to their senses that they should see through the true features of Li Hongzhi from his lies , have a clear understanding of the cult essence of " Falungong , " and return to normal social life ; they should listen no more to lies about the " final consummation , " stop being duped , and stop acting as Li Hongzhi 's instruments and sacrificial victims for opposing society , the people , the motherland , and the law .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Thus , the Taiwan side may possibly ask for procuring Kidd-class destroyers before the opening of the annual US-Taiwan arms sales negotiations scheduled to be held in April . If this is really true , newly elected President Bush will meet , for the first time , a grim challenge in handling the subtle military balance between " China " and Taiwan .  
The local authorities have made great efforts to thoroughly expose the true features of the Falungong cult and the sinister political schemes of Li Hongzhi , popularize scientific and cultural knowledge as well as legal knowledge , and increase the ability of the masses to recognize and stay immune from the cult .  
Through patient , meticulous and earnest ideological and political work over the past year and more , the overwhelming majority of Falungong followers have come to recognize Li Hongzhi 's true features , left the Falungong of their own accord and returned to their normal work , study and life .  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
In the past year and more , the Chinese Government , in the spirit of uniting , educating , and converting the majority , has made a tremendous amount of persuasive , patient , and careful publicity , education , and rescue work .  As a result , the majority of " Falungong " practitioners have recognized Li Hongzhi 's true character and cast off the mental control by the " Falungong " cult and conscientiously left the organization .  
The flames burning those obsessed with " Falungong , " who had set themselves on fire , have also burnt down a mask Li Hongzhi has worn , namely , " the true , the good , and the tolerant " ; have woken up quite a few " lambs that have gone astray " ; and have brought to light such a truth as well : Should we fail to weed out this evil cult , there would be no stability in our country and no security for our people .  
" Being small but highly trained , economical , legitimate , and highly efficient should be the basic norm guiding our efforts in building a modern government , said member Yang Haikun , who added : It is true that we have seen everywhere phenomena like over-staffed institutions , redundant personnel , overlapped functions , or misplaced roles .  
Only by conscientiously implementing the party 's policy towards minority nationalities and put into effect the regional national autonomy can the equal rights of different minority nationalities , as well as the right of autonomy in national autonomous areas , be fully protected ; can the enthusiasm of the people of different ethnic groups be fully aroused ; and can a common prosperity be brought true among different nationalities .  
" With a sparse population , Tibet is rich in resources , the central authorities implement many preferential policies toward the region , and various parts of the country vigorously provide support for it ; In addition , it has late-coming advantages .  By carrying out the strategy of bringing about great-leap-forward development , we are confident in making Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's wish come true that Tibet will advance in the front ranks of China 's modernization drive by the middle of the 21st century . "  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
These energetic and keen VRAs not only help register eligible voters who may otherwise be left out of the electoral roll for one reason or another .  They are also spreading the message of civic education .  This is the perfect exercise for introducing our young people to the democratic process , and to help them develop a true sense of belonging and commitment to Hong Kong , their home , " she said .  
15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .  It can expound the express or implied meaning of the law only within the bounds of the legislative principle of the law in question ; it can not make any expansionist or restrictive interpretation which changes the true legislative intent , for otherwise it would be tantamount to legislative amendment .  
( ii ) The NPCSC will be able to consider our request for clarifying the true legislative intent of the relevant BL provisions at its coming meeting in June .  The following pressing problems call for swift actions to tackle them -  
( a ) clarify whether the views on BL 24 ( 2 ) , endorsed by the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR of the NPC at its fourth plenary session held on 10 August 1996 , has reflected the true legislative intent of the BL correctly and whether they have legal effect .  
In spite of strenuous efforts in implementing the CFA judgment , the implementation difficulties encountered in the past few months ; the population problems triggered by the ruling ; as well as the far-reaching impact on our society and economy have left us with no alternative but to contemplate repeatedly the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions of the Basic Law , with a view to resolving the crisis brought about by the CFA judgment .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Speaking at a business seminar in Kanazawa City of Ishikawa Prefecture , Mr Leung stressed that seeking an interpretation was not an attempt to overrule or reinterpret the CFA 's judgement , which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government ( HKSARG ) respected .  Instead , what the HKSARG had been doing was to seek a legal remedy to the problem of a potential influx of 1.67 million Mainland immigrants , and to establish the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions in the Basic Law governing the Right of Abode in Hong Kong .  
" The principal element of the offence is that the person knowingly provides information to the SFC or the market operator in question that is false , misleading or incomplete in a material particular , or that he does not believe that the information provided is true , complete and accurate in every material particular .  
Sponsored by the Beat Drugs Fund , and co-produced by the Outstanding Young Persons ' Association and the Media Evangelism Ltd . , an anti-drug film entitled " The Final Turn " is now on show until August . The film is based on true case stories provided by Long Ke Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre operated by Wu Oi Christian Centre and is considered a very powerful and creative medium to get across the anti-drug messages to the public . 
To ensure a reflection of the true pictures of the history , Museum staff conducted a series of dedicated exercises to collect relevant information after the content of each exhibit area had been decided on .  Besides consulting reference materials , local and overseas scholars , they also conducted site visits and interviews to enrich the contents of the exhibition .  
The coins will bear the standard Bauhinia design on the obverse side .  On the reverse side , there will be special commemorative designs , each depicting one of five traditional blessings or felicitations in Chinese : " May your wishes come true " , " May every year bring a surplus " , " Speedy success " , " Flowers bloom for prosperity " , and " May your stock turn over like a spinning wheel " .  
" It is no longer true that all Hong Kong people are too wrapped up in making money to pay heed and appreciate their heritage .  Perhaps a majority of them still does but a significant minority is demanding spiritual sustenance from Hong Kong 's rich heritage , be it archeological relics , historical buildings , traditional and cultural practices and all manners of antiquities .  
Miss Willis said Hong Kong has remained true to its foundations of success : the rule of law underpinned by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for business ; free flow of information ; a society which respects human rights and a clean , efficient and effective civil service despite the challenges faced in the past five years .  
Fancinating programmes include doves appearing from nowhere , animation true man show , flash mask changing , manipulation illusions , grand illusions and interactive magic , etc .  Local musician and magician Harry Wong will host the show and lead you to a multicultural magical journey .  
In the true Vandekeybus style , " Blush " is about isolation and liberation .  It is confrontational and intensely physical .  Central to the piece is the human body : restless , unpredictable , powerful yet fragile .  
Six years after reunification , we in Hong Kong remain true to the values and institutions that buttress our development as a separate social , economic and political system from the Mainland ; a free society under the rule of law and an open , pluralistic , tolerant and outward-looking community . " 
Pastor Chou pointed out that the free translation , adoption of special literary styles such as parallelism , and the elimination of conjunctions as far as possible , have allowed the true meaning of the Bible 's religious terminology and idioms to be preserved . The manipulation of punctuation marks , verbs and direct and indirect quotations , have also helped to make the modern Chinese Bible more colloquial , simple , graceful and beautiful .  
Lee survived her college years because she learned early when and to whom it would be safe to speak from her heart , when to conceal her true thoughts , and how to avoid beatings or the excruciating pain of being brainwashed . " I was always nervous , " she says , " not knowing when the Red Guards would find out my real feelings .  
During the shooting of the film Dr . Ngor , still with vivid pictures in his mind about his ordeal , often expressed his displeasure to the producer and director that the film was n't explicit enough in showing the true terror of what went on . Although many of his suggestions were incorporated into the film , many were not because the producer felt it would be too brutal , too real to be accepted as the truth .  
And even Ch'ien-lung had his lapses . Museum experts discovered that a favorite painting from the Yuan dynasty ( 1279-1368 ) , which he had covered with imperial seals and comments , was really a copy and the alleged imitation was the true original .  
Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
May you grow old together " is a traditional good-luck wish for newlyweds . However , according to historians , the chances of that wish coming true were mighty slim in days past . Life expectancy in the Chou dynasty 2,600 years ago was eighteen . In the Han it was a mere 22 , and even as late as 260 years ago , in the Ching dynasty , it was only 28 .  
Thus , the three major government planning departments should use an integrated method for a long-term plan and not only use economic planning to cope with future social change . Only then can there be a " social miracle " to create a true People 's Livelihood " welfare state . " ( 2 ) A planning law should be established and interchange between planning personnel and line agencies strengthened .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
Such words ring only partially true , especially bearing in mind how often the ancients went astray in their observation of nature , as seen in their quaint notion that consuming cinnabar refined from metal and stone could make you live as eternally as those . Resting on the basis of Five Elements theories , no wonder the Eight Cyclical Characters divination method offers skeptics a field day .  
Mahjongg 's compulsive hold over its aficionados can be seen from the following true stories : A typhoon had forced Liu Hsiao-chen to cut short her trip down south , and worriedly she made her way back to Taipei . As she neared home through knee-deep flood water and in the pitch dark of a power blackout her anxiety grew . But stepping in at the door , there were her parents and a couple of neighbors happily engrossed in a game of mahjongg , playing by candlelight and with their feet perched up on stools .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
Although air forces on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have not really tangled since 1958 and there 's no way of measuring the ROC Air Force 's true capabilities , occasional contacts with foreign pilots gives the tactical training center the chance to compare flying skills .  
The Kumon Cultural and Educational Foundation once looked into a true case like this : a child that was bright enough to begin was admitted to a class for gifted students through intensive cramming but found he could n't keep up and had to transfer out . His classmates made fun of him and called him " a phony who was kicked out of the brainy kids ' class " - - a heavy trial for a child at his tender age . "  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
Even though they gave their lives in the air , since they never graduated , the monthly compensation afforded to their families is based on that of a sergeant , not an official pilot - - a mere NT $ 10,000 or so a month , only enough to reopen the wounds of grief of their aging parents . Air force pilots share a passion for flying , and they know that in making their dream come true they may eventually have to pay the ultimate price .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
If it is true that in popular fashion " there is no such thing as absolute rebellion or subversion " and that anti-social and counter-cultural behavior will ultimately be co-opted by the mainstream , then flashy protest can only bring fleeting personal pleasure and has no real function in terms of bringing about social change . Moreover , gender performance can only be done for performance 's sake .  
Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
As the situation threatened to get out of control , Hsu Hsiao-ming broke out in a cold sweat . Under a blazing sun in Chiayi 's Tungshih , a fishing boat going out to sea was to be filmed for Tropical Fish . Chen Yu-hsun anticipated that the film crew might get seasick , so he gave everyone a motion sickness pill before departure . Maybe someone bought the wrong pills - - true , no one got seasick , but everyone became so drowsy that they spent the entire day sound asleep .  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
But Chinese herbal pharmacists distinguish between this drained gall and the gall taken from wild bears , which they call " true gall . " Drained gall , they say , lacks three active medicinal ingredients , and they have indeed shown that it is not as effective as true gall . But because it is only a tenth as expensive , consumers and pharmacies alike are gradually taking to using it for chronic illnesses .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
Whether concerned about knowing love at least once , or about attaining everlasting love , the true meaning of " free love " is listening to your own genuine needs and making responsible choices . The same is also true of Sun Chung-hsing 's personal mission in the " cause " of love .  
The Chinese narcissus ' graceful poise in the water inspired Yang to call it his " guest who floats on the waves . " For him , the light yellow and pale white double-flowered " Delicate Jade " daffodil represented the true narcissus .  
However , as in the example of author Lin Ching-hsuen , people are often wrongly categorized based on these test results , and more and more doubts are being cast on this type of testing . This has been particularly true in recent years with Taiwan 's active promotion of special gifted and talented programs . Because such a large proportion of gifted students are chosen based on IQ tests , the question of the practicality and fairness of such measures has stirred up a great deal of controversy .  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind . The point should be to pursue the true meaning of health and happiness , not such superficial viewpoints as distinguishing EQ grades or gaining advantages .  
Moreover , Islam 's greatest emotional power is in the Qur'an . " It clears the mind and teaches the true way , " he says . The faithful believe that the Qur'an is a record of what the Prophet Mohammed received from Allah . Mohammed was illiterate ; the Qur'an was compiled by his successors based on what Mohammed told them , and completed after his death , in the seventh century CE .  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation . Many ancient Egyptian myths are connected to the water lily . In Egypt , where they worshipped the sun , they have discovered designs in which the sun god Ra sits as a child on a water lily .  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
Yet he was also left with a deep impression of Fang-liang as happy and lively , hospitable , talkative , and sociable . Chiang Ching-kuo 's attitude towards her was one of extreme closeness , and he was full of love and respect for her , leaving her the true master of the house .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Recently Taiwan prime-time variety shows , traditionally devoted to singing and silliness , have taken part in a new wave-telling " true life " stories with such themes as " searching for a long-lost loved one , " " repaying a benefactor , " " charity , " and " warmth . " Striking like a tear-gas canister , they not only set the people immediately involved weeping , they turn the usually light-hearted hosts red-eyed with emotion ; many audience members are likewise deeply moved .  
With improved technology , doctors rely increasingly on machines , and are unwilling to make any judgments before tests are completed . One book called Why Things Bite Back tells the true story of a Stanford University medical student who had a stomach ailment for four weeks . He entered the university hospital , and underwent a series of painful tests , and was told that the problem was with his appendix . But a retired old doctor only had to hear his descriptions of his symptoms , and that veteran physician knew immediately what the problem was .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
The reason dZi beads have been connected to living Buddhas in Taiwan is that many believers take them to Buddhist masters to be " invested with spiritual power . " When Namgyal must tell people that what they supposed was a valuable old dZi bead is just a well-crafted reproduction , even he cushions the blow by saying that they can always ask a master to invest it with spiritual power so that it will become just as effective as a true old dZi bead .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
It is true that Beijing is some way from the ocean , but having been an imperial capital for many centuries , in Wu Weiye 's day it had no lack of fine foods from mountain and sea . If he had only been a little more adventurous : there were no fresh oysters or clams , but as gastronome Tang Lu-sun reminds us , outside Qianmen Gate merchants sold rich , plump , fresh crabs of such exquisite flavor that even Emperor Qianlong was apt to slip out of the Forbidden City in disguise to sample them .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
Lin Shih-hua also recommends that consumers be wary of online retailers who offer goods at prices which seem too good to be true . Often , excited consumers rush to complete their transactions only to discover that they are responsible for hefty shipping charges .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
This independent film festival , which aimed to present the Amis ' own world view , brought together 14 films by four Amis directors and one Japanese director . The organizers attempted to cast off impressions of the aboriginal peoples based on a mishmash of cultural cliches , and also hoped that the festival and its accompanying seminars , concert and gourmet buffet would help city people understand the true " Pangcah . " " Pangcah " is the Amis word for " human being , " and also the term by which the Amis refer to themselves .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Intersexuals ( also known as hermaphrodites ) are people who were born with two sets of sexual organs . They have chromosomal abnormalities or hormonal imbalances and are not transsexuals . People who adopt a persona of the opposite sex for a special reason , such as Mulan ( who took her father 's place in the army ) or the transvestites who change their sex to make a living , can not be counted as true transsexuals .  
Once rice wine became the main type of cooking wine in kitchens , it became part of virtually every dish and every style of cooking , from wok-frying , deep-fat-frying , and pan-frying to stewing , steaming , and sauteing . Great chefs can not do without rice wine , and this is even more true of eateries specializing in wintertime " tonic foods " like shaojiuji , ginger duck , and mutton hot pot , who literally use it like water to create stews that are at once relaxing and invigorating .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what . To paraphrase a doctor who participates in the volunteer overseas medical services provided by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation , no amount of material goods can bring the happiness felt upon seeing the smile of a happy patient .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
" When the sky lanterns themselves only account for 5% of an NT $ 6 million budget , I think the organizers are leaning in the wrong direction , " says Hu Min-shih . Adding singing and dancing may make the celebration more festive , but Hu wishes that the responsible county agencies would spend more on the actual construction and release of sky lanterns , since they are after all the true leading lights of the festival .  
But these lines are only a bit of introductory camouflage ; the song 's true import is revealed a few lines later : " Separated , separated , we grow more resolute . / You may be as distant as a star , as tiny as a firefly / But so long as I have a little of your light , just the merest trace of you . . . / Everything else may alter , but my love will be unchanged . "  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
If the curse of the hardy , abundant , and inexpensive tilapia in the domestic market is its " poor man 's fish " image , the greatest obstacle to foreign sales is the intractable problem of drug residues . This is especially true for the EU market , with its stricter testing standards .  
For example , German scientists are adept at experiments , while scientists from the former Soviet republics are strong in math . Italian scientists often use little tricks , while Finnish scientists are not only capable but also enthusiastic and reliable . American scientists are very straightforward , but sometimes make it hard for people to grasp their true intentions .  
As for questions raised by women 's groups , Shih Chao-hui , who also supports the pro-life position , acknowledges that facing up to the " realities " of abortion may indeed seem like a cruel thing to subject audiences to . And yet , she asks , are not modern terms such as " genetic health , " " termination of pregnancy , " and " induced abortion " simply linguistic traps designed to beautify the act of abortion ? A true view of the body  
With regard to the shocking nature of both the Body Worlds exhibit and the abortion film , all of the above scholars agree that without accompanying documents , lectures , explanations or discussions to allay audience anxieties , simply relying on what is visually apparent will not suffice to reveal the true meaning of life education . Instead , such events may lead to further confusion of public values and errors in understanding . This is where their real concern lies .  
A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
Chang specifically targeted seasoned pedagogues who were at or close to retirement age , reasoning that it would be the best way to attract true lovers of the teaching profession . Such individuals would be teaching primarily for the sheer pleasure of it rather than merely for profit . The teachers ' essentially altruistic persuasion along with their experience and dedication would combine to create an academic atmosphere high in quality but low in expense .  
Although it is true that the untaxed informal sector may escape some legitimate tax burdens and necessary social regulation , its continued existence leads to socially valuable production .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
It is true that some of them have been successfully resolved , but many others , of an ethnic , racial and religious nature , are arising in various parts of the world and are raging unabated , rendering the world situation fragile and precarious .  
While it is true that without a judicial body responsible for implementing and enforcing it , a code would be superfluous , it is also true that without a prior strict definition of the applicable law , a court would be merely an ineffectual body .  
Programmes for disadvantaged or vulnerable groups , in addition to reflecting a true understanding of the underlying problems of each group , must pass the test of being both equitable and efficient .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
This is equally true in the economic and social sphere , and with regard to the constant modernization and honing of democratic institutions , governance , control of the exercise of political power , full and absolute respect for human rights and the daily exercise of such rights and obligations on the part both of those who govern and of those who are governed .  
This is true not only for the economic and social sectors , but also for the reform of the Security Council , which is already the subject of a detailed Italian proposal inspired by the principles of democracy , equitable geographical representation and efficiency . 
A decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity ; in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man 's historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
My proposal to the Assembly is to create an international United Nations fair-play prize to be awarded every year to the student athlete who , in the judgement of a special committee , has acted most in a spirit of generosity and solidarity with his or her team-mates and competitors and demonstrated the true meaning of fair play in student sporting events throughout the year . 
This means that nothing could be done in the absence of the political will of States that bear the responsibility of dispelling doubts and remedying the disaffection that is noticeable today vis - - vis the United Nations by giving true meaning to the Organization 's invaluable and multifarious contributions towards the promotion of an international society that is more just , better organized and better structured .  
Proceeding from this , it is only by improving the collective capabilities of the international community to face up to the urgent and most intolerable injustices that a true meaning could be given to preventive efforts of diplomacy , to peace-keeping operations and to the elaboration of a genuine structure of international cooperation .  
As I have stated , not only is it not true that a majority of the people voted for continued or enhanced territorial status , not only did fewer than half of the eligible voters vote at all , but because of the low percentage , the referendum , on its own legal terms , was invalid .  
We should therefore like to stress the importance of advancing in the creation of a true partnership between the less developed and the more developed , at an appropriate pace , as a crucial step in fostering an equitable and peaceful international system at the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations .  
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
In order to attain such an objective , it is essential for all States to respect established rules governing relations among States , to comply with the principles and objectives of the United Nations , and therefore , to cease supporting terrorism , sowing terror throughout entire societies , resorting to sabotage , following extremist policies , betraying the true religion , and distorting thought .  
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Although the use of this recourse legally conceals an individual 's real status as a mercenary , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services arranged for and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports may serve as evidence in establishing the true status of persons who are justifiably suspected of engaging in mercenary activities .  
This holds true for other United Nations operations , designed to render humanitarian assistance , where a propitious environment is essential and the safe delivery of goods and services to target populations the very purpose - too often threatened by disruptions and the illegal diversion of aid .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from ten to seven , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
My country believes that all Members of the Organization should rise above their differences and shoulder their responsibilities in order to show their true intentions and stand for a common peace that will take the United Nations into the twenty-first century , in which sustainable development will become integral to all nations in the search for a peaceful , secure and bright future for succeeding generations .  
NULLWhile it is true that a high rate of investment is not by itself sufficient to bring about sustained development , no developing country has achieved sustainable , vigorous economic development with low rates of investment .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .  
Mr . AYALA LASSO ( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ) said that the collective vision of the United Nations of the future was that of an Organization reflecting the fact that all human beings were the true participants in the historical process and should be the direct beneficiaries of national and international policies and actions .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
Not only is this new Constitution the best we have ever had , but it also embraces the people 's political expectations for the advent of a true sense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of freedom , respect for human rights , and a strong nationalistic feeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of the world on a free and equitable basis . 
Moreover , it will be in the cities and towns of this urban world that growing social tensions and conflict , rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources , will be resolved , and where the key to true human security will be found .  
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
The Social Summit expressed the political will to take advantage of a window of opportunity that has opened in the world with the end of the cold war to let in fresh air and to overcome the age-old ideological intolerance and rivalries of power politics , which were impediments to true international solidarity and served only selfish self-interest .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
This is particularly true since the United Nations Charter , in our view a view shared by many others still represents a major instrument governing international life , and since any international order , be it old or new , must be based on a solid foundation that respects rights , determines obligations and opens the door to an era of interaction among societies on the basis of acceptance and understanding , not imposition or oppression .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
The international response , however , will to a large extent remain insufficient if it is not reflected in concrete action in line with three requirements : the establishment of true international cooperation ; a show of greater solidarity ; and determination commensurate with regularly stated political commitments .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
In his inaugural address of 26 November 1995 , President Shevardnadze stated , inter alia , that his main strategic goal was the transformation of the old totalitarian social economic formation , " the old order " , into a new social economic system , " the true establishment of democracy and freedom " .  
Perhaps the most accurate picture of the true human rights situation in the United States was to be found in its judicial and penitentiary system , where 1.5-million persons filled the prisons of that country , which had the highest rate of imprisonment and the largest juvenile penal system in the world .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Owing to his personal prestige and his great political stature and vast political experience , President Mobutu is a true adept at regional , African and international affairs alike whether or not his detractors agree .  
" Accuracy " : usually measured in terms of inaccuracy , defined as the maximum deviation , positive or negative , of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value .  
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
Even if the actors involved in our region had doubts as to the true intentions of the new Burundian authorities , the negotiations required a minimum period of time devoted to specifying negotiable points , to approving an agenda , to determining practical modalities , to identifying negotiators and to the forming of the delegations of the various groups that are parties to the conflict .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
If actions at the national level were to be sustained and yield their intended results , international supportive measures ought to be forthcoming in a true spirit of partnership for development .  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
Mechanisms like the present draft protocol must serve as a tool for embodying in international law the obvious need to set up committees of inquiry that would take responsibility together with Governments for the preparation of national reports determined to present the true facts and statistical data reflecting the truth .  
It is true that the Rules are not legally binding , but the way in which they were elaborated in close cooperation between numerous Governments and the community of major international non-governmental organizations , should foster a strong commitment on the part of all parties concerned to promote their implementation .  
But would it be outrageous to say that it is not completely true either , because it is obvious that in Africa there exist countries whose development level is already allowing them to cherish some legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the international market as well as countries that still require assistance , at least in certain areas , and particularly in the social area . 
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
While it was true that fees for courts and lawyers were higher than the average Kenyan might be able to afford , this problem was economic in nature and could best be solved by development projects geared to raising the standards of living of the entire citizenry .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
However , it is fundamentally true that the overall monitoring system could only be made comprehensive when the Council is able to conclude that Iraq 's prohibited programmes have been destroyed , removed or rendered harmless and the full extent of the level of technical development achieved in each of the prohibited programmes is known .  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
While it is true that responsibility for social development lies , first and foremost , with States themselves , which have the right and duty to implement appropriate policies to achieve that objective , it is no less true that this responsibility must be assumed , in a spirit of solidarity , by the international community as a whole , not just because of moral and political requirements that are broadly shared today , but also because of the enlightened self-interest of us all .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
It has become quite obvious that true comprehensive reforms aimed at rendering the Security Council more efficient and more effective are impossible without resolving the problems of its size and equitable composition .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
While it is true that appropriate technologies to limit environmental degradation and reverse the trend can easily be identified , the fact remains that the connection between environmental degradation and egotistically driven consumption which , though it serves as an impetus to economic growth , does not apportion properly the resulting benefits remains to be made , notwithstanding all the fine words to the contrary .  
While it is true that many studies have been made of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment from the point of view of their history , legal basis , regulation or scope , there have been very few on ways of combating violations of them .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
But for many developing country enterprises , quite the opposite may also be true : exposed to international competition , or to domestic competition from firms established with the help of FDI , they may be unable to compete .  
We shall continue our determined action to promote a national and global order based on justice and equity in which all human rights are preserved , promoted and protected in the true spirit of the Universal Declaration . The President took the Chair . 
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
While it was true that there was considerable cultural , historical and political diversity , combined with differing degrees of development , in the Asia and the Pacific region , that only enriched the regions unique character in the area of human rights .  
The girl child was added as the twelfth critical area during the preparatory process , as a result of regional preparations and of pressure to recognize that true progress could be realized only if the next generation was also the subject of special attention .  
The most important of these observations and recommendations stressed that a true saving from the introduction of efficiency measures is achieved if costs are reduced while the level and quality of service is maintained or further improved .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
It was also important to find new ways of gauging international economic performance , not only by using formal economic indicators but also by measuring the informal and even the illegal economy in order to have a true measure of the global , or total , economy .  
The situation of deadlock in which the Conference finds itself now in connection with procedural or organizational issues , which , it is true , have a very important relationship to the substantive consideration of the topics falling within the competence of the Conference , regrettably have a negative impact on its credibility , in which the international community has vested its confidence so that it will consider issues of disarmament and nuclear disarmament in particular . 
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
It is true that in certain outlying areas teachers salaries are below the minimum , because resources are insufficient to pay equal salaries throughout the country : this is one reason why there is a shortage of teaching staff , since they prefer to move to the capital in search of a better standard of living .  
It is true that the death penalty is established in extremely serious cases for the perpetrators of some truly appalling crimes , such as using the country for international drug trafficking , and serious acts of rape or corruption of minors , since in the prevailing global circumstances Cuba deems the death penalty indispensable for deterring these repugnant conducts . 
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
The true victims of wars are children and elderly persons who are displaced or made refugees , women who are raped , young people who are murdered , mothers who lose their economic livelihoods , innocent workers whose workplaces are destroyed , students whose schools are bombed and sick people who can not go to hospitals because there are neither bridges nor medicines . 
If true reconciliation and cooperation are to be realized , mutual visits should be effected between the north and the south of Korea and free discussion and activities by patriotic organizations for reunification ensured .  
As a representative of a State subjected to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the aggression carried out daily by two permanent Council Members , I launch an appeal to the Council to abandon the double standard and to be true to the role assigned to it in the Charter .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
Mindful of the potential opportunities and risks inherent in the globalization process , the States members of UNCTAD commit themselves to engage in a true partnership for development designed to promote a dynamic and equitable global economic environment .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
Even though it was true that primary responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 lay with each individual country , it was also true that international cooperation was an important complementary factor in taking advantage of the real benefits of sustainable development .  
Ms . Faetanini ( San Marino ) said that the General Assembly , at its twentieth special session , had stressed that drug supply and demand were closely linked and had placed the drug problem in its true perspective by emphasizing its social , economic and political implications .  
While it is true that achieving social development , improving our economic performance and eradicating poverty are first and foremost national responsibilities , they can be successfully achieved only through the collective will and collective efforts of the international community as outlined by the principles and objectives of Copenhagen . 
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
While it goes without saying that we have a legal obligation to abide by relevant international law , it is also true , regrettably , that compliance with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict needs to be further improved in the wake of numerous violations of such norms .  
It is true that the small island developing States will have to make their own efforts for development , but the vigorous support of the international community is indispensable given that economic globalization is creating unprecedented and fierce competition .  
Together , we must seek the objective of non-proliferation from all aspects , with a view to ensuring that the Treaty will become a true international tool for effective nuclear disarmament as well as a solid foundation for more productive international cooperation on the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes on a non-discriminatory basis , and within the context of a system of recognized international guarantees .  
The universal ratification of the six core human rights treaties , including the optional protocols thereto , within the next five years , would not only serve as a decisive step towards a shared international legal commitment to the implementation of all human rights but would also symbolize the international communitys willingness to work in a true spirit of partnership to reach common goals .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
This is also true for the more general subject of transparency in conventional weapons , where we consider the Conference can and must complete the valuable work accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee established between the years 1992 and 1995 , to define concrete measures likely to increase confidence amongst States and strengthen international security .  
It is sad but true that the sovereignty arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical result of finding excuses for repressive , even murderous Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the human rights of their own citizens .  
This is especially true where products ( especially services ) are difficult to specify clearly and may vary significantly in quality ( for which sufficient adjustment is not made ) , and where annual national average prices are able to fall , quite logically , within a wide price band ( as say , in the case of India or China ) .  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
Modern criminals long ago realized the true advantages of close international links , and they have not been slow to use them for their antisocial purposes , often keeping a few steps ahead of the forces of law and order .  
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
He noted that the Paris Declaration 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely , that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
The true impact of the meeting would become apparent in the months ahead , but UNDP was confident that the meeting represented a major step towards regaining for its work the political support and attention that it deserved .  
While it is true that East Timor must rely on its bilateral and multilateral partners and that the mission should not do anything that those partners are prepared to do , I nevertheless believe that there are vital parts of government , particularly in the areas mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report those of central management , fiscal management , justice and human rights , and security and national sovereignty where it would be entirely justified to place advisory staff and a small number of line managers in the East Timor Government . 
To ensure true respect for freedom of the press and equal access of the various political forces to the public and private media , whether written or audio-visual , under a regulatory system that is in line with democratic principles ;  
He noted that the Paris Declaration of 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
We request you to intervene and to designate a time and place for the handover of this property without reference to the mechanisms established by Security Council resolution 1284 ( 1999 ) , whose true objective , as has now become clear one and a half years after its adoption , is to deceive world public opinion , to impose a long series of conditions on the lifting of the unjust embargo being maintained against Iraq and to rewrite the previous Security Council resolutions in a tendentious and unlawful manner .  
Powers vying for the territories of the Ottoman Empire indeed found a willing collaborator in the ultra-nationalist Armenian leadership , which , at such a historic juncture , forsook the true and lasting interests of their people , threw all the peoples of eastern Anatolia into imminent danger knowingly risking widespread communal violence in their haste to carve out an independent Armenia .  
Third countries should remain wary of returning certain categories of refugees to Bosnia and Herzegovina , especially when those refugees are determined to be in continued need of international protection by UNHCR or are from such areas where ethnically motivated violations of economic and social rights persists and where there is no true climate of security .  
He did so because his sense as a true believer told him that the correct standards of the faith may be inadequate when a man and his family are starving , and because he regarded hunger as something more heinous than theft , and considered that saving someone from ruin was more important than protecting a persons property .  
Pop queen Madonna 's upcoming spiritual tour to Israel to study a mysterious Jewish philosophy has raised questions over her true faith .  Does the self-proclaimed material girl really have faith in the traditional ancient Jewish mysticism or is this simply the latest fashion of self-help for celebrities .  
After the spring term begins , all middle and primary schools , education administrative departments and relevant organizations should publicize the government 's educational policy and the correct educational thinking and methods to the parents , exchange with them or introduce to them the experience of educating children scientifically , guide them to take a correct attitude toward education and know the true meaning of talent , and guide their eagerness to see their children succeed in life to the right direction .  
Without concentrating our energy , we can neither accelerate development nor bring true its advancedment and since the productive forces of our country never experienced a full development under capitalist conditions , we must complete , under socialist conditions , the task of industrialization and economic socialization , marketization , and modernization which advanced countries will complete under capitalist conditions .  
6 .  Find Market Prestige Through Quality After-Sales Service Household electrical appliances are expensive durable consumer goods ; only part of an appliance is sold when it leaves a store , as a sale in its true meaning is completed only when it is fully installed and fit for safe usage .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
When the training entered the stage of camouflage concentration target confrontation , offices and soldiers of the " red army " set up concentration targets , such as real and false artillery positions , missile positions , and field airports using camouflage to make true targets invisible while leaving false targets exposed , such as shaped defilade , smoke screen , and false target .  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
In consumption , last year 84-million medium and low-wage townsfolk increased their income , bank interest was reduced , tax on interest was levied , and the system of true names for deposits was put into effect , festival holidays were extended , and other policies for stimulating consumption were put into effect ; all this played a role in encouraging people , with the result that social consumption changed out of the slackness of the previous two years .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
We should learn from his noble character of selflessness , with which he has become a model of virtue for others , realized the true value of his life through making selfless dedications , and has retained the true political color of a communist party member .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
They are used to social entertainment , talking in a flamboyant manner and even employ trickery and conceal the true state of affairs from their supervisors and subordinates .  These negative working styles have damaged the Party 's image , contaminated Party conduct and hurt the enthusiasm of the masses .  This has been extremely harmful to the Party 's causes .  
Sinking into the mire deeper and deeper , they were finally devoid of all senses and lost self-control .  It is true that Li Hongzhi and his like are cunning and their fallacies are quite deceitful , but the tragic end of some " Falungong " infatuates could not be separated from their ignorance and a lack of a correct world outlook and a correct outlook on life .  
Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
Our military 's current budget-making method was based on the planned economy .  It is true that this method has played a positive role in ensuringassuring the all aspects of military in every construction , but this method has such problems , such as being too general in contents , not being transparent and being too weak to bein binding .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
China has cracked down on " Falungong " according to the law , exposed Li Hongzhi 's deception , cut off the murdering paws of the cults , made most " Falungong " practitioners see through the true nature of the cult and enabled them to return to normal life , rescued those fanatic practitioners who fell into the trap set up by the cult , and helped avoid the occurrence of human tragedy .  
The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
This indicates that what he said one year ago about not pursuing " Taiwan independence " was just a forced move to which he had no alternative , and as soon as he held that he had firm footing , or had a certain support from foreign forces , he showed his true features .  
It is true that the party , before long after its establishment , realized that , in light of the Chinese real situation of a semicolonial and semi-feudalistic society , the party should give priority to toppling imperialist and feudalistic forces over the immediate establishment of a socialist society not to mention a communist society , a task for far ahead in the future .  
In order to meet the needs of modern warfare , and make sure that the unit will master the true skills of being " prompt in mobilization , prompt in operations , prompt in coordination , and worthy of performance assessments , " the unit established a small group for training soldiers with science and technology in 2000 .  The small group , composed of key elements of all departments , has conducted active explorations by focusing on the topic of " emergency mobilization of non-motorized radar . "  
Internet media should adopt a serious and responsible attitude and build a whole set of standard systems for posting news and information and guarding the door , and practice strict self-discipline , so as to provide true and accurate news and information for society , establish public trustworthiness , and build a good social image of Internet media .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .  
You have been fulfilling the general demand of Chairman Jiang 's " five phrases " , meeting high standards , and completely improving the quality of the troops bearing in mind the historical mission of " fighting to win " and " maintaining the true qualities , " thus outstandingly accomplishing all tasks bestowed on you by the people , forging the veteran Tibetan spirit of " being particularly able to bear hardship , to fight , to endure , to remain united , and to dedicate yourselves , " and producing large numbers of advanced role models .  
This horrifying incident and brutal tragedy has once again thoroughly unmasked the ugly face of Li Hongzhi and his so called " the true , the good , and the tolerant , " and has further laid bare to the world the ugly and inhumane nature of the " Falungong " as an evil cult that harms life .  
You have always maintained the true political qualities of being loyal to the party , to the country , to the people and to socialism .  You have resolutely waged struggles against western hostile forces and the national splittists , won great victories in suppressing rebels and bandits and in the self-defense counterattack , forcefully maintained border and social stability in Tibet , and defended our state sovereignty , territorial integrity and national unity .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
We should learn from them their true political qualities of carrying forward and developing the glorious traditions of our party and our army , consciously resisting temptations , firmly holding the defense line , and always " resisting and keeping away from corrosive influences . "  We should learn from them their up-to-the-mark work style of running the inspection post strictly , ensuring a strict enforcement of the law , stressing on decorum , and observing discipline .  
It goes without saying that our foreign policy should be a steady one , and we should conceal our true features and gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck .  However , Japanese authorities have behaved with unbearable insolence for a long time ; their unfriendly attitude towards China has been clearly showed by a series of incidents , such as the Diaoyutai incident , the incident of altering textbooks , the incident of paying homage to Yasukuni Shrine , and the incident of imposing punitive tariffs on imported Chinese farm products .  
We have gathered a lot of female " Falungong " practitioners who disturbed social order and through our help , most of them have realized Li Hongzhi 's true colors and " Falungong 's " evil nature .  Consequently , Masanjia Reeducation Center has become the most prominent target that has been attacked and slandered by Li Hongzhi and his gang .  
The Soviet Union was all along reticent about the true figures of its military spending .  The total amount of its defense expenditures , published for the first time in 1989 , was 77.3 billion rubles .  It was further admitted in 1990 that its military spending represented one-fourth of its national budget .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .  
In facing the complex situation before them , we hope that Taiwan 's leaders will deeply consider the true and the false , and set a beneficial policy , under the principle of one China , and with the two sides of the Strait as its center , with the people as its center , to promote a constructive trust and peaceful stability as the way forward , instead of a conflict creating a new potential conflict .

In fact , the United States has never intended to make Taiwan an " independent " country in the true sense of the word .  Taiwan is a mere pawn on the US strategic chessboard and an " unsinkable aircraft carrier " deployed in the Far East Pacific region by the United States . Whether the United States will retain or abandon this pawn is determined not by its consideration of Taiwan people 's interests but solely by the consideration of its own national interests .  
It is true that the new Taiwan leader purposely and very nicely packaged " Taiwan independence " theories and did not specifically mention " Taiwan independence " at all .  However , the main theme of " Taiwan independence " permeated the whole speech .  He particularly stressed the " democratic and equal " status between " Taiwan " and " China , " purposely severed the connections between Taiwan and mother mainland , and words and sentences about splittist concepts and separatism were abundant .  
As may be seen from Chen Shuibian 's [ Ch'en Shui-pian ] inaugural speech on 20 May , this " minority leader " who took power with 39 percent of the popular vote is still hard-pressed to promote " Taiwan Independence " at present .  Under domestic and international pressure , he has forged compromises with all sides , and his government is presented with pretty wording and an academic wrapping .  However , all these are unable to conceal the consistently true nature of things .  
At this summit , both Kim Chong-il and Kim Yong Nam have emphatically stressed the importance of " independence and reunification " ; and have pointed out that since " foreign countries are not happy to see a united Korean Peninsula to become a strong country " and will surely place various kinds of obstacles to hinder reunification , the Korean nation must rely on its own strength , independently resolve the nation 's internal contradictions , and bring true the country 's grand cause of reunification .  
Minister of Public Security , Jia Chunwang , spoke at the meeting .  He said : Liu Jinguo 's advanced deeds embody the firm faith of a communist and demonstrate the true color of a public functionary as well as the loyalty and dauntlessness of people 's police .  He is an outstanding representative of so many heroic models of public security organs across the country .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .  
Associate Professor Liu Guoshen said : Mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors seem like the first light of the day in the current critical cross-strait relations .  These visits , serving as an opportunity for both sides of the strait to advance toward mutual trust and reconciliation , can not come true because of obstructions by the Taiwan side under " all sorts of pretexts . "  This is regrettable .  
Second , we should earnestly make the administrative activities open to the masses and let them know about the situation and exercise supervision , and also strengthen the internal supervisory and binding mechanism of the administrative organs so as to ensure that the contents made public are true , fair , and trustworthy .  
The rapid development of the Internet has played an important role in bringing about world economic growth and the strengthening of contacts among the people of various countries .  However , we must realize that there exist some problems regarding the Internet that make people worried : There is an overflow of junk information that is anti-science , pseudo-science , unhealthy or even very harmful .  Some people intentionally publish information that does not conform to the truth to mislead people 's understanding about the true situation .  
Their struggle would also bring endless disasters to humankind .  If , on the other hand , these two poles become true " constructive strategic partners " and join hands in safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world with concerted efforts , the 21st century will have lasting peace and become the most peaceful century in modern history .  This will be the two countries ' greatest contributions to all humankind .  
This responsible person noted that ever since the true features the " Falungong " as a religious cult were revealed , over 98 percent of the " Falungong " practitioners have seen the error of their ways and are determined to make a clean break with their past .  Today , they have successfully extricated themselves from Li Hongzhi 's spiritual control , and are leading a normal life .  
However , their moves met with strong opposition from the local overseas Chinese students , ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese nationals , who wrote to the press , denouncing their perverse and evil preaching and exposing their tricks in hoodwinking the public as well as the despicable deeds of the " Falungong " members who robbed people in the streets because they were possessed by the devil , thus laying bear the true features of the " Falungong " as a cult .  
Although the story might not be true , the idea expressed by the story really calls for deep thought .  The reason why our country , a country with a civilization of 5,000 years , has not declined despite tribulation but has risen in high spirit despite repeated adversity is that it has many broad and profound ideas and has a powerful intrinsic cohesive force .  
According to an informed source , the tragedy of building collapse in Houjie , Dongguan , has aroused great attention of the central authorities .  The fact that relevant departments in Dongguan concealed the true death toll on purpose for several days in a row has drawn the ire of Beijing authorities .  The Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Public Security have dispatched an investigation group to Dongguan to learn about the truth of the incident through non-governmental channels .  
We advise those " Falungong " members who have not yet come to their senses that they should see through the true features of Li Hongzhi from his lies , have a clear understanding of the cult essence of " Falungong , " and return to normal social life ; they should listen no more to lies about the " final consummation , " stop being duped , and stop acting as Li Hongzhi 's instruments and sacrificial victims for opposing society , the people , the motherland , and the law .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Thus , the Taiwan side may possibly ask for procuring Kidd-class destroyers before the opening of the annual US-Taiwan arms sales negotiations scheduled to be held in April . If this is really true , newly elected President Bush will meet , for the first time , a grim challenge in handling the subtle military balance between " China " and Taiwan .  
The local authorities have made great efforts to thoroughly expose the true features of the Falungong cult and the sinister political schemes of Li Hongzhi , popularize scientific and cultural knowledge as well as legal knowledge , and increase the ability of the masses to recognize and stay immune from the cult .  
Through patient , meticulous and earnest ideological and political work over the past year and more , the overwhelming majority of Falungong followers have come to recognize Li Hongzhi 's true features , left the Falungong of their own accord and returned to their normal work , study and life .  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
In the past year and more , the Chinese Government , in the spirit of uniting , educating , and converting the majority , has made a tremendous amount of persuasive , patient , and careful publicity , education , and rescue work .  As a result , the majority of " Falungong " practitioners have recognized Li Hongzhi 's true character and cast off the mental control by the " Falungong " cult and conscientiously left the organization .  
The flames burning those obsessed with " Falungong , " who had set themselves on fire , have also burnt down a mask Li Hongzhi has worn , namely , " the true , the good , and the tolerant " ; have woken up quite a few " lambs that have gone astray " ; and have brought to light such a truth as well : Should we fail to weed out this evil cult , there would be no stability in our country and no security for our people .  
" Being small but highly trained , economical , legitimate , and highly efficient should be the basic norm guiding our efforts in building a modern government , said member Yang Haikun , who added : It is true that we have seen everywhere phenomena like over-staffed institutions , redundant personnel , overlapped functions , or misplaced roles .  
Only by conscientiously implementing the party 's policy towards minority nationalities and put into effect the regional national autonomy can the equal rights of different minority nationalities , as well as the right of autonomy in national autonomous areas , be fully protected ; can the enthusiasm of the people of different ethnic groups be fully aroused ; and can a common prosperity be brought true among different nationalities .  
" With a sparse population , Tibet is rich in resources , the central authorities implement many preferential policies toward the region , and various parts of the country vigorously provide support for it ; In addition , it has late-coming advantages .  By carrying out the strategy of bringing about great-leap-forward development , we are confident in making Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's wish come true that Tibet will advance in the front ranks of China 's modernization drive by the middle of the 21st century . "  
People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
These energetic and keen VRAs not only help register eligible voters who may otherwise be left out of the electoral roll for one reason or another .  They are also spreading the message of civic education .  This is the perfect exercise for introducing our young people to the democratic process , and to help them develop a true sense of belonging and commitment to Hong Kong , their home , " she said .  
15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .  It can expound the express or implied meaning of the law only within the bounds of the legislative principle of the law in question ; it can not make any expansionist or restrictive interpretation which changes the true legislative intent , for otherwise it would be tantamount to legislative amendment .  
( ii ) The NPCSC will be able to consider our request for clarifying the true legislative intent of the relevant BL provisions at its coming meeting in June .  The following pressing problems call for swift actions to tackle them -  
( a ) clarify whether the views on BL 24 ( 2 ) , endorsed by the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR of the NPC at its fourth plenary session held on 10 August 1996 , has reflected the true legislative intent of the BL correctly and whether they have legal effect .  
In spite of strenuous efforts in implementing the CFA judgment , the implementation difficulties encountered in the past few months ; the population problems triggered by the ruling ; as well as the far-reaching impact on our society and economy have left us with no alternative but to contemplate repeatedly the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions of the Basic Law , with a view to resolving the crisis brought about by the CFA judgment .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Speaking at a business seminar in Kanazawa City of Ishikawa Prefecture , Mr Leung stressed that seeking an interpretation was not an attempt to overrule or reinterpret the CFA 's judgement , which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government ( HKSARG ) respected .  Instead , what the HKSARG had been doing was to seek a legal remedy to the problem of a potential influx of 1.67 million Mainland immigrants , and to establish the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions in the Basic Law governing the Right of Abode in Hong Kong .  
" The principal element of the offence is that the person knowingly provides information to the SFC or the market operator in question that is false , misleading or incomplete in a material particular , or that he does not believe that the information provided is true , complete and accurate in every material particular .  
Sponsored by the Beat Drugs Fund , and co-produced by the Outstanding Young Persons ' Association and the Media Evangelism Ltd . , an anti-drug film entitled " The Final Turn " is now on show until August . The film is based on true case stories provided by Long Ke Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre operated by Wu Oi Christian Centre and is considered a very powerful and creative medium to get across the anti-drug messages to the public . 
To ensure a reflection of the true pictures of the history , Museum staff conducted a series of dedicated exercises to collect relevant information after the content of each exhibit area had been decided on .  Besides consulting reference materials , local and overseas scholars , they also conducted site visits and interviews to enrich the contents of the exhibition .  
The coins will bear the standard Bauhinia design on the obverse side .  On the reverse side , there will be special commemorative designs , each depicting one of five traditional blessings or felicitations in Chinese : " May your wishes come true " , " May every year bring a surplus " , " Speedy success " , " Flowers bloom for prosperity " , and " May your stock turn over like a spinning wheel " .  
" It is no longer true that all Hong Kong people are too wrapped up in making money to pay heed and appreciate their heritage .  Perhaps a majority of them still does but a significant minority is demanding spiritual sustenance from Hong Kong 's rich heritage , be it archeological relics , historical buildings , traditional and cultural practices and all manners of antiquities .  
Miss Willis said Hong Kong has remained true to its foundations of success : the rule of law underpinned by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for business ; free flow of information ; a society which respects human rights and a clean , efficient and effective civil service despite the challenges faced in the past five years .  
Fancinating programmes include doves appearing from nowhere , animation true man show , flash mask changing , manipulation illusions , grand illusions and interactive magic , etc .  Local musician and magician Harry Wong will host the show and lead you to a multicultural magical journey .  
In the true Vandekeybus style , " Blush " is about isolation and liberation .  It is confrontational and intensely physical .  Central to the piece is the human body : restless , unpredictable , powerful yet fragile .  
Six years after reunification , we in Hong Kong remain true to the values and institutions that buttress our development as a separate social , economic and political system from the Mainland ; a free society under the rule of law and an open , pluralistic , tolerant and outward-looking community . " 
Pastor Chou pointed out that the free translation , adoption of special literary styles such as parallelism , and the elimination of conjunctions as far as possible , have allowed the true meaning of the Bible 's religious terminology and idioms to be preserved . The manipulation of punctuation marks , verbs and direct and indirect quotations , have also helped to make the modern Chinese Bible more colloquial , simple , graceful and beautiful .  
Lee survived her college years because she learned early when and to whom it would be safe to speak from her heart , when to conceal her true thoughts , and how to avoid beatings or the excruciating pain of being brainwashed . " I was always nervous , " she says , " not knowing when the Red Guards would find out my real feelings .  
During the shooting of the film Dr . Ngor , still with vivid pictures in his mind about his ordeal , often expressed his displeasure to the producer and director that the film was n't explicit enough in showing the true terror of what went on . Although many of his suggestions were incorporated into the film , many were not because the producer felt it would be too brutal , too real to be accepted as the truth .  
And even Ch'ien-lung had his lapses . Museum experts discovered that a favorite painting from the Yuan dynasty ( 1279-1368 ) , which he had covered with imperial seals and comments , was really a copy and the alleged imitation was the true original .  
Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
May you grow old together " is a traditional good-luck wish for newlyweds . However , according to historians , the chances of that wish coming true were mighty slim in days past . Life expectancy in the Chou dynasty 2,600 years ago was eighteen . In the Han it was a mere 22 , and even as late as 260 years ago , in the Ching dynasty , it was only 28 .  
Thus , the three major government planning departments should use an integrated method for a long-term plan and not only use economic planning to cope with future social change . Only then can there be a " social miracle " to create a true People 's Livelihood " welfare state . " ( 2 ) A planning law should be established and interchange between planning personnel and line agencies strengthened .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
Such words ring only partially true , especially bearing in mind how often the ancients went astray in their observation of nature , as seen in their quaint notion that consuming cinnabar refined from metal and stone could make you live as eternally as those . Resting on the basis of Five Elements theories , no wonder the Eight Cyclical Characters divination method offers skeptics a field day .  
Mahjongg 's compulsive hold over its aficionados can be seen from the following true stories : A typhoon had forced Liu Hsiao-chen to cut short her trip down south , and worriedly she made her way back to Taipei . As she neared home through knee-deep flood water and in the pitch dark of a power blackout her anxiety grew . But stepping in at the door , there were her parents and a couple of neighbors happily engrossed in a game of mahjongg , playing by candlelight and with their feet perched up on stools .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
Although air forces on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have not really tangled since 1958 and there 's no way of measuring the ROC Air Force 's true capabilities , occasional contacts with foreign pilots gives the tactical training center the chance to compare flying skills .  
The Kumon Cultural and Educational Foundation once looked into a true case like this : a child that was bright enough to begin was admitted to a class for gifted students through intensive cramming but found he could n't keep up and had to transfer out . His classmates made fun of him and called him " a phony who was kicked out of the brainy kids ' class " - - a heavy trial for a child at his tender age . "  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
Even though they gave their lives in the air , since they never graduated , the monthly compensation afforded to their families is based on that of a sergeant , not an official pilot - - a mere NT $ 10,000 or so a month , only enough to reopen the wounds of grief of their aging parents . Air force pilots share a passion for flying , and they know that in making their dream come true they may eventually have to pay the ultimate price .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
If it is true that in popular fashion " there is no such thing as absolute rebellion or subversion " and that anti-social and counter-cultural behavior will ultimately be co-opted by the mainstream , then flashy protest can only bring fleeting personal pleasure and has no real function in terms of bringing about social change . Moreover , gender performance can only be done for performance 's sake .  
Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
My knowledge of Taiwan comes only from newspapers and television . I have only a blurred impression , which is quite far from true understanding . Also , continued political hostility and the lack of direct travel between the two sides are even bigger barriers to real understanding between Taiwan and mainland China .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
As the situation threatened to get out of control , Hsu Hsiao-ming broke out in a cold sweat . Under a blazing sun in Chiayi 's Tungshih , a fishing boat going out to sea was to be filmed for Tropical Fish . Chen Yu-hsun anticipated that the film crew might get seasick , so he gave everyone a motion sickness pill before departure . Maybe someone bought the wrong pills - - true , no one got seasick , but everyone became so drowsy that they spent the entire day sound asleep .  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
But Chinese herbal pharmacists distinguish between this drained gall and the gall taken from wild bears , which they call " true gall . " Drained gall , they say , lacks three active medicinal ingredients , and they have indeed shown that it is not as effective as true gall . But because it is only a tenth as expensive , consumers and pharmacies alike are gradually taking to using it for chronic illnesses .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
Whether concerned about knowing love at least once , or about attaining everlasting love , the true meaning of " free love " is listening to your own genuine needs and making responsible choices . The same is also true of Sun Chung-hsing 's personal mission in the " cause " of love .  
The Chinese narcissus ' graceful poise in the water inspired Yang to call it his " guest who floats on the waves . " For him , the light yellow and pale white double-flowered " Delicate Jade " daffodil represented the true narcissus .  
However , as in the example of author Lin Ching-hsuen , people are often wrongly categorized based on these test results , and more and more doubts are being cast on this type of testing . This has been particularly true in recent years with Taiwan 's active promotion of special gifted and talented programs . Because such a large proportion of gifted students are chosen based on IQ tests , the question of the practicality and fairness of such measures has stirred up a great deal of controversy .  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind . The point should be to pursue the true meaning of health and happiness , not such superficial viewpoints as distinguishing EQ grades or gaining advantages .  
Moreover , Islam 's greatest emotional power is in the Qur'an . " It clears the mind and teaches the true way , " he says . The faithful believe that the Qur'an is a record of what the Prophet Mohammed received from Allah . Mohammed was illiterate ; the Qur'an was compiled by his successors based on what Mohammed told them , and completed after his death , in the seventh century CE .  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation . Many ancient Egyptian myths are connected to the water lily . In Egypt , where they worshipped the sun , they have discovered designs in which the sun god Ra sits as a child on a water lily .  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
Yet he was also left with a deep impression of Fang-liang as happy and lively , hospitable , talkative , and sociable . Chiang Ching-kuo 's attitude towards her was one of extreme closeness , and he was full of love and respect for her , leaving her the true master of the house .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Recently Taiwan prime-time variety shows , traditionally devoted to singing and silliness , have taken part in a new wave-telling " true life " stories with such themes as " searching for a long-lost loved one , " " repaying a benefactor , " " charity , " and " warmth . " Striking like a tear-gas canister , they not only set the people immediately involved weeping , they turn the usually light-hearted hosts red-eyed with emotion ; many audience members are likewise deeply moved .  
With improved technology , doctors rely increasingly on machines , and are unwilling to make any judgments before tests are completed . One book called Why Things Bite Back tells the true story of a Stanford University medical student who had a stomach ailment for four weeks . He entered the university hospital , and underwent a series of painful tests , and was told that the problem was with his appendix . But a retired old doctor only had to hear his descriptions of his symptoms , and that veteran physician knew immediately what the problem was .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
The reason dZi beads have been connected to living Buddhas in Taiwan is that many believers take them to Buddhist masters to be " invested with spiritual power . " When Namgyal must tell people that what they supposed was a valuable old dZi bead is just a well-crafted reproduction , even he cushions the blow by saying that they can always ask a master to invest it with spiritual power so that it will become just as effective as a true old dZi bead .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
It is true that Beijing is some way from the ocean , but having been an imperial capital for many centuries , in Wu Weiye 's day it had no lack of fine foods from mountain and sea . If he had only been a little more adventurous : there were no fresh oysters or clams , but as gastronome Tang Lu-sun reminds us , outside Qianmen Gate merchants sold rich , plump , fresh crabs of such exquisite flavor that even Emperor Qianlong was apt to slip out of the Forbidden City in disguise to sample them .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
Lin Shih-hua also recommends that consumers be wary of online retailers who offer goods at prices which seem too good to be true . Often , excited consumers rush to complete their transactions only to discover that they are responsible for hefty shipping charges .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
This independent film festival , which aimed to present the Amis ' own world view , brought together 14 films by four Amis directors and one Japanese director . The organizers attempted to cast off impressions of the aboriginal peoples based on a mishmash of cultural cliches , and also hoped that the festival and its accompanying seminars , concert and gourmet buffet would help city people understand the true " Pangcah . " " Pangcah " is the Amis word for " human being , " and also the term by which the Amis refer to themselves .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Intersexuals ( also known as hermaphrodites ) are people who were born with two sets of sexual organs . They have chromosomal abnormalities or hormonal imbalances and are not transsexuals . People who adopt a persona of the opposite sex for a special reason , such as Mulan ( who took her father 's place in the army ) or the transvestites who change their sex to make a living , can not be counted as true transsexuals .  
Once rice wine became the main type of cooking wine in kitchens , it became part of virtually every dish and every style of cooking , from wok-frying , deep-fat-frying , and pan-frying to stewing , steaming , and sauteing . Great chefs can not do without rice wine , and this is even more true of eateries specializing in wintertime " tonic foods " like shaojiuji , ginger duck , and mutton hot pot , who literally use it like water to create stews that are at once relaxing and invigorating .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what . To paraphrase a doctor who participates in the volunteer overseas medical services provided by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation , no amount of material goods can bring the happiness felt upon seeing the smile of a happy patient .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
" When the sky lanterns themselves only account for 5% of an NT $ 6 million budget , I think the organizers are leaning in the wrong direction , " says Hu Min-shih . Adding singing and dancing may make the celebration more festive , but Hu wishes that the responsible county agencies would spend more on the actual construction and release of sky lanterns , since they are after all the true leading lights of the festival .  
But these lines are only a bit of introductory camouflage ; the song 's true import is revealed a few lines later : " Separated , separated , we grow more resolute . / You may be as distant as a star , as tiny as a firefly / But so long as I have a little of your light , just the merest trace of you . . . / Everything else may alter , but my love will be unchanged . "  
Eight of the ten largest tourist agencies in Japan manage domestic tourism and depend solely on this market . Japan has managed the tourism industry with amazing skill . This is especially true for the hot springs areas popular with the silver-haired generation , where nature is combined with human artifice , places that can truly be described as " products of culture , " like the famous Hakone and Izu hot springs areas .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
If the curse of the hardy , abundant , and inexpensive tilapia in the domestic market is its " poor man 's fish " image , the greatest obstacle to foreign sales is the intractable problem of drug residues . This is especially true for the EU market , with its stricter testing standards .  
For example , German scientists are adept at experiments , while scientists from the former Soviet republics are strong in math . Italian scientists often use little tricks , while Finnish scientists are not only capable but also enthusiastic and reliable . American scientists are very straightforward , but sometimes make it hard for people to grasp their true intentions .  
As for questions raised by women 's groups , Shih Chao-hui , who also supports the pro-life position , acknowledges that facing up to the " realities " of abortion may indeed seem like a cruel thing to subject audiences to . And yet , she asks , are not modern terms such as " genetic health , " " termination of pregnancy , " and " induced abortion " simply linguistic traps designed to beautify the act of abortion ? A true view of the body  
With regard to the shocking nature of both the Body Worlds exhibit and the abortion film , all of the above scholars agree that without accompanying documents , lectures , explanations or discussions to allay audience anxieties , simply relying on what is visually apparent will not suffice to reveal the true meaning of life education . Instead , such events may lead to further confusion of public values and errors in understanding . This is where their real concern lies .  
A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
Chang specifically targeted seasoned pedagogues who were at or close to retirement age , reasoning that it would be the best way to attract true lovers of the teaching profession . Such individuals would be teaching primarily for the sheer pleasure of it rather than merely for profit . The teachers ' essentially altruistic persuasion along with their experience and dedication would combine to create an academic atmosphere high in quality but low in expense .  
Although it is true that the untaxed informal sector may escape some legitimate tax burdens and necessary social regulation , its continued existence leads to socially valuable production .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
It is true that some of them have been successfully resolved , but many others , of an ethnic , racial and religious nature , are arising in various parts of the world and are raging unabated , rendering the world situation fragile and precarious .  
While it is true that without a judicial body responsible for implementing and enforcing it , a code would be superfluous , it is also true that without a prior strict definition of the applicable law , a court would be merely an ineffectual body .  
Programmes for disadvantaged or vulnerable groups , in addition to reflecting a true understanding of the underlying problems of each group , must pass the test of being both equitable and efficient .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
This is equally true in the economic and social sphere , and with regard to the constant modernization and honing of democratic institutions , governance , control of the exercise of political power , full and absolute respect for human rights and the daily exercise of such rights and obligations on the part both of those who govern and of those who are governed .  
This is true not only for the economic and social sectors , but also for the reform of the Security Council , which is already the subject of a detailed Italian proposal inspired by the principles of democracy , equitable geographical representation and efficiency . 
A decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity ; in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man 's historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
My proposal to the Assembly is to create an international United Nations fair-play prize to be awarded every year to the student athlete who , in the judgement of a special committee , has acted most in a spirit of generosity and solidarity with his or her team-mates and competitors and demonstrated the true meaning of fair play in student sporting events throughout the year . 
This means that nothing could be done in the absence of the political will of States that bear the responsibility of dispelling doubts and remedying the disaffection that is noticeable today vis - - vis the United Nations by giving true meaning to the Organization 's invaluable and multifarious contributions towards the promotion of an international society that is more just , better organized and better structured .  
Proceeding from this , it is only by improving the collective capabilities of the international community to face up to the urgent and most intolerable injustices that a true meaning could be given to preventive efforts of diplomacy , to peace-keeping operations and to the elaboration of a genuine structure of international cooperation .  
As I have stated , not only is it not true that a majority of the people voted for continued or enhanced territorial status , not only did fewer than half of the eligible voters vote at all , but because of the low percentage , the referendum , on its own legal terms , was invalid .  
We should therefore like to stress the importance of advancing in the creation of a true partnership between the less developed and the more developed , at an appropriate pace , as a crucial step in fostering an equitable and peaceful international system at the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations .  
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
In order to attain such an objective , it is essential for all States to respect established rules governing relations among States , to comply with the principles and objectives of the United Nations , and therefore , to cease supporting terrorism , sowing terror throughout entire societies , resorting to sabotage , following extremist policies , betraying the true religion , and distorting thought .  
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Although the use of this recourse legally conceals an individual 's real status as a mercenary , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services arranged for and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports may serve as evidence in establishing the true status of persons who are justifiably suspected of engaging in mercenary activities .  
This holds true for other United Nations operations , designed to render humanitarian assistance , where a propitious environment is essential and the safe delivery of goods and services to target populations the very purpose - too often threatened by disruptions and the illegal diversion of aid .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from ten to seven , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
Although true , Mr . van der Stoel 's words are intentionally misleading in that he claims to feel sorry for the children of Iraq , yet at the same time fails to request the lifting of the embargo against them ; on the contrary , he holds the Government of Iraq responsible for such human suffering on account of its non-implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 ( 1991 ) and 712 ( 1991 ) , despite being satisfied as to their political objectives .  
My country believes that all Members of the Organization should rise above their differences and shoulder their responsibilities in order to show their true intentions and stand for a common peace that will take the United Nations into the twenty-first century , in which sustainable development will become integral to all nations in the search for a peaceful , secure and bright future for succeeding generations .  
NULLWhile it is true that a high rate of investment is not by itself sufficient to bring about sustained development , no developing country has achieved sustainable , vigorous economic development with low rates of investment .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding UNRWA has been reduced in the past year from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .  
Mr . AYALA LASSO ( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ) said that the collective vision of the United Nations of the future was that of an Organization reflecting the fact that all human beings were the true participants in the historical process and should be the direct beneficiaries of national and international policies and actions .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
Not only is this new Constitution the best we have ever had , but it also embraces the people 's political expectations for the advent of a true sense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love of freedom , respect for human rights , and a strong nationalistic feeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest of the world on a free and equitable basis . 
Moreover , it will be in the cities and towns of this urban world that growing social tensions and conflict , rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources , will be resolved , and where the key to true human security will be found .  
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
The Social Summit expressed the political will to take advantage of a window of opportunity that has opened in the world with the end of the cold war to let in fresh air and to overcome the age-old ideological intolerance and rivalries of power politics , which were impediments to true international solidarity and served only selfish self-interest .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
This is particularly true since the United Nations Charter , in our view a view shared by many others still represents a major instrument governing international life , and since any international order , be it old or new , must be based on a solid foundation that respects rights , determines obligations and opens the door to an era of interaction among societies on the basis of acceptance and understanding , not imposition or oppression .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
The international response , however , will to a large extent remain insufficient if it is not reflected in concrete action in line with three requirements : the establishment of true international cooperation ; a show of greater solidarity ; and determination commensurate with regularly stated political commitments .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
In his inaugural address of 26 November 1995 , President Shevardnadze stated , inter alia , that his main strategic goal was the transformation of the old totalitarian social economic formation , " the old order " , into a new social economic system , " the true establishment of democracy and freedom " .  
Perhaps the most accurate picture of the true human rights situation in the United States was to be found in its judicial and penitentiary system , where 1.5-million persons filled the prisons of that country , which had the highest rate of imprisonment and the largest juvenile penal system in the world .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Owing to his personal prestige and his great political stature and vast political experience , President Mobutu is a true adept at regional , African and international affairs alike whether or not his detractors agree .  
" Accuracy " : usually measured in terms of inaccuracy , defined as the maximum deviation , positive or negative , of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value .  
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
Even if the actors involved in our region had doubts as to the true intentions of the new Burundian authorities , the negotiations required a minimum period of time devoted to specifying negotiable points , to approving an agenda , to determining practical modalities , to identifying negotiators and to the forming of the delegations of the various groups that are parties to the conflict .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
If actions at the national level were to be sustained and yield their intended results , international supportive measures ought to be forthcoming in a true spirit of partnership for development .  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
Mechanisms like the present draft protocol must serve as a tool for embodying in international law the obvious need to set up committees of inquiry that would take responsibility together with Governments for the preparation of national reports determined to present the true facts and statistical data reflecting the truth .  
It is true that the Rules are not legally binding , but the way in which they were elaborated in close cooperation between numerous Governments and the community of major international non-governmental organizations , should foster a strong commitment on the part of all parties concerned to promote their implementation .  
But would it be outrageous to say that it is not completely true either , because it is obvious that in Africa there exist countries whose development level is already allowing them to cherish some legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the international market as well as countries that still require assistance , at least in certain areas , and particularly in the social area . 
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
While it was true that fees for courts and lawyers were higher than the average Kenyan might be able to afford , this problem was economic in nature and could best be solved by development projects geared to raising the standards of living of the entire citizenry .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
However , it is fundamentally true that the overall monitoring system could only be made comprehensive when the Council is able to conclude that Iraq 's prohibited programmes have been destroyed , removed or rendered harmless and the full extent of the level of technical development achieved in each of the prohibited programmes is known .  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
While it is true that responsibility for social development lies , first and foremost , with States themselves , which have the right and duty to implement appropriate policies to achieve that objective , it is no less true that this responsibility must be assumed , in a spirit of solidarity , by the international community as a whole , not just because of moral and political requirements that are broadly shared today , but also because of the enlightened self-interest of us all .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
It has become quite obvious that true comprehensive reforms aimed at rendering the Security Council more efficient and more effective are impossible without resolving the problems of its size and equitable composition .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
General and complete disarmament is now a universal need , and it should be perceived in its original terms , namely , that there is not nor can there be any alternative to the achievement of true nuclear disarmament , which alone can free mankind from apocalypse , ensure security for all and channel nuclear energy to economic and social development by using it exclusively for peaceful means .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
While it is true that appropriate technologies to limit environmental degradation and reverse the trend can easily be identified , the fact remains that the connection between environmental degradation and egotistically driven consumption which , though it serves as an impetus to economic growth , does not apportion properly the resulting benefits remains to be made , notwithstanding all the fine words to the contrary .  
While it is true that many studies have been made of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment from the point of view of their history , legal basis , regulation or scope , there have been very few on ways of combating violations of them .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
But for many developing country enterprises , quite the opposite may also be true : exposed to international competition , or to domestic competition from firms established with the help of FDI , they may be unable to compete .  
We shall continue our determined action to promote a national and global order based on justice and equity in which all human rights are preserved , promoted and protected in the true spirit of the Universal Declaration . The President took the Chair . 
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
While it was true that there was considerable cultural , historical and political diversity , combined with differing degrees of development , in the Asia and the Pacific region , that only enriched the regions unique character in the area of human rights .  
The girl child was added as the twelfth critical area during the preparatory process , as a result of regional preparations and of pressure to recognize that true progress could be realized only if the next generation was also the subject of special attention .  
The most important of these observations and recommendations stressed that a true saving from the introduction of efficiency measures is achieved if costs are reduced while the level and quality of service is maintained or further improved .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
It was also important to find new ways of gauging international economic performance , not only by using formal economic indicators but also by measuring the informal and even the illegal economy in order to have a true measure of the global , or total , economy .  
The situation of deadlock in which the Conference finds itself now in connection with procedural or organizational issues , which , it is true , have a very important relationship to the substantive consideration of the topics falling within the competence of the Conference , regrettably have a negative impact on its credibility , in which the international community has vested its confidence so that it will consider issues of disarmament and nuclear disarmament in particular . 
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
It is true that in certain outlying areas teachers salaries are below the minimum , because resources are insufficient to pay equal salaries throughout the country : this is one reason why there is a shortage of teaching staff , since they prefer to move to the capital in search of a better standard of living .  
It is true that the death penalty is established in extremely serious cases for the perpetrators of some truly appalling crimes , such as using the country for international drug trafficking , and serious acts of rape or corruption of minors , since in the prevailing global circumstances Cuba deems the death penalty indispensable for deterring these repugnant conducts . 
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
The true victims of wars are children and elderly persons who are displaced or made refugees , women who are raped , young people who are murdered , mothers who lose their economic livelihoods , innocent workers whose workplaces are destroyed , students whose schools are bombed and sick people who can not go to hospitals because there are neither bridges nor medicines . 
If true reconciliation and cooperation are to be realized , mutual visits should be effected between the north and the south of Korea and free discussion and activities by patriotic organizations for reunification ensured .  
As a representative of a State subjected to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the aggression carried out daily by two permanent Council Members , I launch an appeal to the Council to abandon the double standard and to be true to the role assigned to it in the Charter .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
Mindful of the potential opportunities and risks inherent in the globalization process , the States members of UNCTAD commit themselves to engage in a true partnership for development designed to promote a dynamic and equitable global economic environment .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
Even though it was true that primary responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 lay with each individual country , it was also true that international cooperation was an important complementary factor in taking advantage of the real benefits of sustainable development .  
Ms . Faetanini ( San Marino ) said that the General Assembly , at its twentieth special session , had stressed that drug supply and demand were closely linked and had placed the drug problem in its true perspective by emphasizing its social , economic and political implications .  
While it is true that achieving social development , improving our economic performance and eradicating poverty are first and foremost national responsibilities , they can be successfully achieved only through the collective will and collective efforts of the international community as outlined by the principles and objectives of Copenhagen . 
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
While it goes without saying that we have a legal obligation to abide by relevant international law , it is also true , regrettably , that compliance with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict needs to be further improved in the wake of numerous violations of such norms .  
It is true that the small island developing States will have to make their own efforts for development , but the vigorous support of the international community is indispensable given that economic globalization is creating unprecedented and fierce competition .  
Together , we must seek the objective of non-proliferation from all aspects , with a view to ensuring that the Treaty will become a true international tool for effective nuclear disarmament as well as a solid foundation for more productive international cooperation on the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes on a non-discriminatory basis , and within the context of a system of recognized international guarantees .  
The universal ratification of the six core human rights treaties , including the optional protocols thereto , within the next five years , would not only serve as a decisive step towards a shared international legal commitment to the implementation of all human rights but would also symbolize the international communitys willingness to work in a true spirit of partnership to reach common goals .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
This is also true for the more general subject of transparency in conventional weapons , where we consider the Conference can and must complete the valuable work accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee established between the years 1992 and 1995 , to define concrete measures likely to increase confidence amongst States and strengthen international security .  
It is sad but true that the sovereignty arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical result of finding excuses for repressive , even murderous Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the human rights of their own citizens .  
This is especially true where products ( especially services ) are difficult to specify clearly and may vary significantly in quality ( for which sufficient adjustment is not made ) , and where annual national average prices are able to fall , quite logically , within a wide price band ( as say , in the case of India or China ) .  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
Modern criminals long ago realized the true advantages of close international links , and they have not been slow to use them for their antisocial purposes , often keeping a few steps ahead of the forces of law and order .  
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
He noted that the Paris Declaration 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely , that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
The true impact of the meeting would become apparent in the months ahead , but UNDP was confident that the meeting represented a major step towards regaining for its work the political support and attention that it deserved .  
While it is true that East Timor must rely on its bilateral and multilateral partners and that the mission should not do anything that those partners are prepared to do , I nevertheless believe that there are vital parts of government , particularly in the areas mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report those of central management , fiscal management , justice and human rights , and security and national sovereignty where it would be entirely justified to place advisory staff and a small number of line managers in the East Timor Government . 
To ensure true respect for freedom of the press and equal access of the various political forces to the public and private media , whether written or audio-visual , under a regulatory system that is in line with democratic principles ;  
He noted that the Paris Declaration of 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
We request you to intervene and to designate a time and place for the handover of this property without reference to the mechanisms established by Security Council resolution 1284 ( 1999 ) , whose true objective , as has now become clear one and a half years after its adoption , is to deceive world public opinion , to impose a long series of conditions on the lifting of the unjust embargo being maintained against Iraq and to rewrite the previous Security Council resolutions in a tendentious and unlawful manner .  
Powers vying for the territories of the Ottoman Empire indeed found a willing collaborator in the ultra-nationalist Armenian leadership , which , at such a historic juncture , forsook the true and lasting interests of their people , threw all the peoples of eastern Anatolia into imminent danger knowingly risking widespread communal violence in their haste to carve out an independent Armenia .  
Third countries should remain wary of returning certain categories of refugees to Bosnia and Herzegovina , especially when those refugees are determined to be in continued need of international protection by UNHCR or are from such areas where ethnically motivated violations of economic and social rights persists and where there is no true climate of security .  
He did so because his sense as a true believer told him that the correct standards of the faith may be inadequate when a man and his family are starving , and because he regarded hunger as something more heinous than theft , and considered that saving someone from ruin was more important than protecting a persons property .
