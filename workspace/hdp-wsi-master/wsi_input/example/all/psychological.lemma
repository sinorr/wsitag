However , the " maximum training method " of the missile company raised a historical challenge against the traditional method of launching missiles .  The so-called " maximum training method " is to have launchers engage in strenuous exercise first so their pulse rates will reach about 150 per minute .  Immediately the launchers will be asked to launch a missile .  This training is designed to assimilate the psychological state of being in a real combat , so as to train the launchers the ability of stabilizing their emotions in a tense situation .  
Although this is an extreme case in a tiny minority , it is sufficient to show : Reducing the heavy academic burden on students and fostering their fine psychological quality and legal concepts are a pressing task .  
Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
All categories of schools at all levels should adopt resolute measures to effect both temporary and permanent resolution of the problems of lightening primary and middle school students ' heavy schoolwork and psychological and economic burdens , keep a firm grip on this work , and resolutely put an end to the wrong practice where primary and middle schools and their teachers rank the students ' positions according to examination ratings .

Luo Dahua , professor of psychology of China Politics and Law University , said : In foreign countries , the main purpose of their psychologists ' visits to prisons is to cure criminals with fairly evident psychological disease , but in China , our psychological treatment for criminals is aimed at transforming them in line with the criminals ' personal characteristics and raising the psychological quality of the entire group of prisoners .  
In the process of ideological and political construction , we must take improving ideological and political qualities as the first task in cultivating high-quality talented military people ; meanwhile , we should insure students are competent in such aspects as science and culture , professional military skills , physical abilities and psychological qualities .  
In order to overcome several limitations of their combat vehicles , including a long and wide body , a limited field of vision , and so on , the regiment organized its vehicle crew to drive the " Dongfeng " Type-145 truck for a week first in order to find out and feel all sorts of functions and parameters of their extra-long and extra-wide heavy-duty vehicles and this laid a psychological and technological basis for them to drive or operate their light armored vehicles .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
Due to the prompt action taken in education and effective measures implemented , everyone maintained a healthy psychological attitude on the scientific knowledge in highland .  While not fearing the highland , they adopted a serious attitude to counter the problems on highland .

Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
Beyond controversy , electronic warfare , military deception , operation secrecy , and psychological warfare are the typical " soft " methods of attack .  And real object destruction is a goal of firepower warfare , in which adjusted firepower weapons are used to hit the enemy 's command posts , command control centers , intelligence centers , and other key places .

Sun Yanling , a farmer at the outskirts of Bengbu City , Anhui , lost her life because she left her treatment of illness to " Falungong . "  According to statistics , obsessed by Li Hongzhi 's warped theories and heretical thinking , more than 1,600 people have died because of suicides or because they refused to be treated by a doctor for their illnesses ; 651 people have developed psychological problems ;  
Their twisted and fallacious theories create great psychological pressure on many people , not only driving their followers to the path of death , making their wives and children walk out on them , breaking up the families , and ruining lives , but also seriously undermining public order , violating the law and normal moral standards , infringing on basic human rights and freedom , and lead to anti-humanity , anti-social , and anti-science crimes .

Though quite a few US congressmen , including both senators and representatives , had expressed strong opposition to delinking the Chinese communists ' improvement on human rights with the MFN status , the US Congress eventually gave in to its self-advertised psychological tactic of economic liberalization and decided to normalize trade relations with China , and this deprived the United States of a strong bargaining counter with regard to sanctions against China over the issue of human rights .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
While cracking a number of major criminal gangs , public security organs in various places have also launched massive offensives of political propaganda to thoroughly crush the psychological defense of criminals .  The " Strike Hard " campaign has thus won another batch of victories .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
Launching a psychological offensive in conjunction with military action and breaking down the enemies ' morale through applying psychological pressure that leads to their defeat and to the seizing of the initiative in a war has been a favorite method embraced by both Chinese and foreign military thinkers both ancient and modern times .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
" Unprecedentedly , Taiwan is in contact and linked with the motherland . "  This has enabled the people on the island to understand the motherland in greater depth and changed their impression about the mainland , thereby enhancing to a great extent their sense of ethnic identification and unity with the motherland .  A profound social and psychological foundation has thus been established for " one country , two systems " to go deep into the hearts of the Taiwan people .  
After gaining an understanding of the Chinese communists ' deeds and plan for united front work , the case was raised to the level of national security and psychological strategies .  National security units and the staff officers ' headquarters have held a series of meetings to study ways and means of tackling the problem , and President Chen will be hearing reports on the case .  
The psychological and electronic warfare troops established recently by the PLA coordinated for the first time the operations of military reconnaissance satellites over the Taiwan Strait . The second stage was " combined forces of the navy , the army and the air force crossing the Strait and carrying out landing operations , " which mostly consisted of guided missile attacks and other methods .  This illustrates the fact that the manner adopted by the PLA to attack Taiwan has switched from one of a " sea-borne landing " to " airborne raids " and other varieties .  
After the West 's armed forces led by the United States had sampled the " sweet taste " of victory , they intensified their theoretical research and brought forth new ideas about actual combat : building modernized psychological warfare training centers , and establishing specialized psychological warfare units .  
With their indomitable will , strong physique , flexible tactics , excellent astuteness and resourcefulness , and fluent English , members of the special forces team from the Beijing Military Region challenged physiological and psychological limits and broke many records in the contest .

We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
The Taiwan stock market has been all gloomy since the new Taiwan authorities assumed power .  The Weighted Index has fallen below the psychological level of 8,000 points , and the daily stock turnover has kept shrinking , once even registering only 50.2 billion New Taiwan dollars , a depressing sight .  
In the long-voyage practical training , the academy has set up a variety of tactical backgrounds and training items to fight strong enemies by exploiting the opportunity that foreign warships , aircraft , and submarines have frequently tailed and followed us to conduct reconnaissance .

Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
Meanwhile , it is necessary to do a real , good job of the software building in a bid to heighten the quality of services , adhere to the principle of moving people with a warm heart and genuine feelings , combine medical treatment with psychological treatment , and expedite the early recovery of the healthcare recipients with their " affectionate hearts " and quality services .  
" Related sectors " indicated that Taiwan 's current economic warning signals undoubtedly reflect fundamental problems and , even more so , elements of political unrest .  These elements have had a negative psychological impact that resulted in numerous economic measures failing to immediately achieve their expected results .  The fundamental policy of " long-term accumulation of short-term blows " caused a mutually destructive situation that was definitely not the people 's good fortune .

Mrs Chu said : " The victims of domestic violence need a comprehensive range of support services , such as clinical psychological services , housing arrangement , legal assistance , financial assistance , job placement and medical services , to help them overcome trauma and resume normal functioning . "  " Thus , the ' one-stop ' service approach is to ensure that the victims and their family members will get what they need as soon as possible through strengthening coordination with other government departments , non-governmental organisations and related professionals . "  
I am confident that these two special measures I have just announced - a further freeze on four major livelihood fee categories and the extended ULSD concession - will bring about psychological and economic relief to the general public and the transport trade .  Both measures should be beneficial to bringing further economic growth and help lift the mood of the people . "

The former approach , used by athletes , falls under the psychological heading of image therapy . Requiring no physical activity to reach its goal , the method might be considered a type of positive thinking exercise . Pleasant experiences are reinforced , and negative stimuli are reduced to a bare minimum .  
More seriously , both psychological and physiological symptoms may occur at the same time . For instance , hypertension , restlessness , irascibility , and irrational fear combined with rapid heartbeat , high blood pressure , headache , and indigestion may indicate neurasthenia , or a " nervous breakdown . " Stress is well-nigh ubiquitous in its effect on health and bodily systems , and the illnesses most closely related to it are termed psychosomatic .  
After the lifting of martial law , civil servants suffered blows mainly from two sides . One was policy instability caused by too rapid change and a lack of clarity in the laws . Another side rose out of the " psychological lifting of martial law , " raising consciousness of popular rights and leading to demands reasonable and unreasonable upon the government .  
Yeh Ying-kun , former director of the Taipei Municipal Psychological Center , did a study in 1989 of psychological illnesses in the Taiwan area over the past thirty years . He discovered that though the incidence of schizophrenia has not changed , there has been an increase in psychosomatic disorders arising from interpersonal relations , confusion , fear and behavioral irregularities , leading to backaches , diarrhea , headaches , and so on .  
A study of the behavioral problems of gifted children in elementary schools in Taipei found that 50 percent of them had had psychological difficulties such as " I 'd like to do a lot of things but I do n't have the courage , " " I 'm afraid of being put in a poor class in middle school " and " I have a lot of bad habits . "  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
The Chang 's , for instance , who were the first to become foster parents , have become an " instructional boot camp " - - and not just for new foster parents . Since they 're so outgoing and personable , rich in experience and adept at breaking through a child 's " psychological defenses , " Sung Li-hsun often sends children to the Chang 's first so they can see how fostering works and adapt to the local environment before being " parceled out . "  
The ancestral home , in use for four generations , was thus levelled overnight . For the older generation who are accustomed to living in the ho-yuan , there are psychological obstacles in making the leap into a tall building in a single bound .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual .

One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
If they do n't deal with the psychological impact of these experiences and seek counseling , these nightmarish incidents are likely to haunt them for the rest of their lives . The littleboy victims often turn into perpetrators themselves , whereas the girls tend toward the opposite extreme . Their own bodies have been so violated that their sense of proper boundaries has been weakened , and they grow up to become women who are repeatedly raped .  
Based upon various different research conclusions , Goleman expresses the strong belief that social problems , particularly the worsening problems among children and adolescents , are linked to the emotions . For example , crime rates , suicide rates , underage pregnancy and drug use , as well as many kinds of psychological disorders such as depression and anorexia can all be attributed to individual emotional disorders or defects .  
Afterwards , she became aware of the unsettled , disorderly atmosphere in her home , and realized that it might be affecting the other two children . She was worried that they did not know how to deal with a severely handicapped little brother , and that this would create difficulties in their interpersonal relationships .

Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind . The point should be to pursue the true meaning of health and happiness , not such superficial viewpoints as distinguishing EQ grades or gaining advantages .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Disaster struck again in October at the 10,000-man tug-of-war organized by the Taipei City Government when the rope broke , causing two people to lose arms and others to suffer internal injuries . Anticipating that in addition to the physical injuries , there would be some who would need to be treated for psychological shock , Hu Wei-herng , director of the Taipei City Psychiatric Center , worked together with a psychiatric team from Mackay Memorial Hospital to evaluate the emotional state of the victims .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
Urbanization has also made interactions between people more complex . Some of the psychological problems of modern people are not like those of the past , which were comprehensible to the average person . For this reason , more people have been going to see psychological counselors over the last few years . The numbers of people waiting to see a doctor in the psychiatric wards of hospitals or at institutions which provide psychological care provide ample evidence of this .  
Hayashi Eidai says , of the Volunteers : " Do n't be distracted by their seemingly pro-Japanese public appearance , sometimes dressed in Japanese uniforms , with Japanese caps , and singing Japanese army songs . As soon as they had a drink it was not at all unknown for them to start cursing the Japanese for being heartless and immoral , and damning Japanese imperialism . " Clearly , the Volunteers carry heavy psychological baggage from the war .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
He explains : " From both the psychiatric literature and clinical experience , doctors discovered that there 's a peculiar phenomenon with people suffering psychological disorders . Once they 're in hospital , the disorders can be controlled quite well , but when they return home , not long thereafter the symptoms re-emerge . " Doctors thus became curious about the family backgrounds of their patients , and social workers were sent to investigate . The result has been the discovery of many dysfunctional families .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
When you first hear the term " art therapy , " it seems very mysterious . But in fact , art therapy is one kind of psychological therapy and like any other psychological therapy , its object can be differentiated based on health status ( the mentally ill and those with non-clinical mental health problems ) , on age ( children , adolescents , the middle-aged , the elderly ) , on type of illness , or stage of illness ( early , terminal ) , on patterns of behavior ( smokers , non-smokers ) and so forth .  
Dance therapists find that the same activity will be expressed in various ways . Some patients act like a bionic man with extraordinary strength , possibly showing violent tendencies . Some appear to move effortlessly , as if they were light as feather . In each case the movement is a reflection of the patient 's current psychological state .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
According to Cheng , research in Taiwan and abroad has consistently demonstrated that severe depression , alcohol and drug addiction , psychological instability and personality disorders , and suicidal behavior by close blood relatives are all clear contributing factors to suicide . Moreover , Dr . George Brown , a fellow of the British Academy , stresses that the experience of loss events also plays a decisive role as a catalyst for suicide .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
To this end , in October 2003 the center established the Suicide Prevention Center . It also appointed " informers " in police bureaus , fire brigades , and neighborhood hospitals to build a protection net . As soon as the center receives an attempted suicide report from an emergency ward , it tries to conduct a thoroughgoing follow-up and to provide psychological counseling to the patient to prevent another suicide attempt .  
She begins by developing their understanding of their bodies through drawing their genitals , giving self-evaluations , charting menstrual cycles , learning to put on a condom , and studying other contraceptive methods before moving on to the psychological side with work on self-affirmation and interpersonal relations . Ultimately , she asks the students to confront the issues of birth , aging , illness and death by having them interview elderly persons , share their feelings about caring for grandparents who have been the victims of strokes , and write a living will .

Mrs . BEZLEPKINA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the period of reorientation resulting from Russia 's adoption of democratic values and ideals the country 's internal resources were strained and its people were struggling with a falling standard of living .

Their twisted and fallacious theories create great psychological pressure on many people , not only driving their followers to the path of death , making their wives and children walk out on them , breaking up the families , and ruining lives , but also seriously undermining public order , violating the law and normal moral standards , infringing on basic human rights and freedom , and lead to anti-humanity , anti-social , and anti-science crimes .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
Though quite a few US congressmen , including both senators and representatives , had expressed strong opposition to delinking the Chinese communists ' improvement on human rights with the MFN status , the US Congress eventually gave in to its self-advertised psychological tactic of economic liberalization and decided to normalize trade relations with China , and this deprived the United States of a strong bargaining counter with regard to sanctions against China over the issue of human rights .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
While cracking a number of major criminal gangs , public security organs in various places have also launched massive offensives of political propaganda to thoroughly crush the psychological defense of criminals .  The " Strike Hard " campaign has thus won another batch of victories .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
Launching a psychological offensive in conjunction with military action and breaking down the enemies ' morale through applying psychological pressure that leads to their defeat and to the seizing of the initiative in a war has been a favorite method embraced by both Chinese and foreign military thinkers both ancient and modern times .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
" Unprecedentedly , Taiwan is in contact and linked with the motherland . "  This has enabled the people on the island to understand the motherland in greater depth and changed their impression about the mainland , thereby enhancing to a great extent their sense of ethnic identification and unity with the motherland .  A profound social and psychological foundation has thus been established for " one country , two systems " to go deep into the hearts of the Taiwan people .  
After gaining an understanding of the Chinese communists ' deeds and plan for united front work , the case was raised to the level of national security and psychological strategies .  National security units and the staff officers ' headquarters have held a series of meetings to study ways and means of tackling the problem , and President Chen will be hearing reports on the case .  
The psychological and electronic warfare troops established recently by the PLA coordinated for the first time the operations of military reconnaissance satellites over the Taiwan Strait . The second stage was " combined forces of the navy , the army and the air force crossing the Strait and carrying out landing operations , " which mostly consisted of guided missile attacks and other methods .  This illustrates the fact that the manner adopted by the PLA to attack Taiwan has switched from one of a " sea-borne landing " to " airborne raids " and other varieties .  
After the West 's armed forces led by the United States had sampled the " sweet taste " of victory , they intensified their theoretical research and brought forth new ideas about actual combat : building modernized psychological warfare training centers , and establishing specialized psychological warfare units .  
With their indomitable will , strong physique , flexible tactics , excellent astuteness and resourcefulness , and fluent English , members of the special forces team from the Beijing Military Region challenged physiological and psychological limits and broke many records in the contest .  The team came first among foreign teams in terms of total points and won championship in nine out of 19 items .  It was also the only team that was awarded the " Prize for the Best Performance in Military Skills . "  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
The Taiwan stock market has been all gloomy since the new Taiwan authorities assumed power .  The Weighted Index has fallen below the psychological level of 8,000 points , and the daily stock turnover has kept shrinking , once even registering only 50.2 billion New Taiwan dollars , a depressing sight .  
In the long-voyage practical training , the academy has set up a variety of tactical backgrounds and training items to fight strong enemies by exploiting the opportunity that foreign warships , aircraft , and submarines have frequently tailed and followed us to conduct reconnaissance .  The purpose is to improve the cadets ' psychological state so that they will not be disquieted but can take quick , wise , and decisive actions in time of danger .  
Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
Meanwhile , it is necessary to do a real , good job of the software building in a bid to heighten the quality of services , adhere to the principle of moving people with a warm heart and genuine feelings , combine medical treatment with psychological treatment , and expedite the early recovery of the healthcare recipients with their " affectionate hearts " and quality services .  
" Related sectors " indicated that Taiwan 's current economic warning signals undoubtedly reflect fundamental problems and , even more so , elements of political unrest .  These elements have had a negative psychological impact that resulted in numerous economic measures failing to immediately achieve their expected results .  The fundamental policy of " long-term accumulation of short-term blows " caused a mutually destructive situation that was definitely not the people 's good fortune .  
29 .  In chapter 20 of " enhancing ideological and ethical education and of building a common ideological and spiritual support , " " particularly enhance ideological , political , ethical quality , and legal system education among youngsters " was revised to " particularly enhance ideological , political , ethical quality , psychological health , and legal system education among youngsters .

For example , in the case of the Hospital Authority ( HA ) , there is a set of comprehensive guidelines on management of victims of sexual assaults in its hospitals , including services to be provided by A &amp; amp ; E doctors , as well as coordination in the collection of forensic samples by forensic pathologists and provision of psychological and counselling support by clinical psychologists , psychiatrists and medical social workers . 
Mrs Chu said : " The victims of domestic violence need a comprehensive range of support services , such as clinical psychological services , housing arrangement , legal assistance , financial assistance , job placement and medical services , to help them overcome trauma and resume normal functioning . "  " Thus , the ' one-stop ' service approach is to ensure that the victims and their family members will get what they need as soon as possible through strengthening coordination with other government departments , non-governmental organisations and related professionals . "  
I am confident that these two special measures I have just announced - a further freeze on four major livelihood fee categories and the extended ULSD concession - will bring about psychological and economic relief to the general public and the transport trade .  Both measures should be beneficial to bringing further economic growth and help lift the mood of the people . "

The former approach , used by athletes , falls under the psychological heading of image therapy . Requiring no physical activity to reach its goal , the method might be considered a type of positive thinking exercise . Pleasant experiences are reinforced , and negative stimuli are reduced to a bare minimum .  
More seriously , both psychological and physiological symptoms may occur at the same time . For instance , hypertension , restlessness , irascibility , and irrational fear combined with rapid heartbeat , high blood pressure , headache , and indigestion may indicate neurasthenia , or a " nervous breakdown . " Stress is well-nigh ubiquitous in its effect on health and bodily systems , and the illnesses most closely related to it are termed psychosomatic .  
After the lifting of martial law , civil servants suffered blows mainly from two sides . One was policy instability caused by too rapid change and a lack of clarity in the laws . Another side rose out of the " psychological lifting of martial law , " raising consciousness of popular rights and leading to demands reasonable and unreasonable upon the government .  
Yeh Ying-kun , former director of the Taipei Municipal Psychological Center , did a study in 1989 of psychological illnesses in the Taiwan area over the past thirty years . He discovered that though the incidence of schizophrenia has not changed , there has been an increase in psychosomatic disorders arising from interpersonal relations , confusion , fear and behavioral irregularities , leading to backaches , diarrhea , headaches , and so on .  
A study of the behavioral problems of gifted children in elementary schools in Taipei found that 50 percent of them had had psychological difficulties such as " I 'd like to do a lot of things but I do n't have the courage , " " I 'm afraid of being put in a poor class in middle school " and " I have a lot of bad habits . "  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
The Chang 's , for instance , who were the first to become foster parents , have become an " instructional boot camp " - - and not just for new foster parents . Since they 're so outgoing and personable , rich in experience and adept at breaking through a child 's " psychological defenses , " Sung Li-hsun often sends children to the Chang 's first so they can see how fostering works and adapt to the local environment before being " parceled out . "  
The ancestral home , in use for four generations , was thus levelled overnight . For the older generation who are accustomed to living in the ho-yuan , there are psychological obstacles in making the leap into a tall building in a single bound .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
One evening at about eight o'clock , after most people 's busy workdays have drawn to a close and they are peacefully settling down to watch the TV dramas about family love and crisis that prevail in this time slot , Hsieh Chiao-an , a volunteer at a psychological counseling center , is listening to true life stories about how a woman is physically abused by her philandering husband .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
If they do n't deal with the psychological impact of these experiences and seek counseling , these nightmarish incidents are likely to haunt them for the rest of their lives . The littleboy victims often turn into perpetrators themselves , whereas the girls tend toward the opposite extreme . Their own bodies have been so violated that their sense of proper boundaries has been weakened , and they grow up to become women who are repeatedly raped .  
Based upon various different research conclusions , Goleman expresses the strong belief that social problems , particularly the worsening problems among children and adolescents , are linked to the emotions . For example , crime rates , suicide rates , underage pregnancy and drug use , as well as many kinds of psychological disorders such as depression and anorexia can all be attributed to individual emotional disorders or defects .  
Afterwards , she became aware of the unsettled , disorderly atmosphere in her home , and realized that it might be affecting the other two children . She was worried that they did not know how to deal with a severely handicapped little brother , and that this would create difficulties in their interpersonal relationships . She therefore had them take part in a psychological treatment group designed especially for children .  
Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind . The point should be to pursue the true meaning of health and happiness , not such superficial viewpoints as distinguishing EQ grades or gaining advantages .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Disaster struck again in October at the 10,000-man tug-of-war organized by the Taipei City Government when the rope broke , causing two people to lose arms and others to suffer internal injuries . Anticipating that in addition to the physical injuries , there would be some who would need to be treated for psychological shock , Hu Wei-herng , director of the Taipei City Psychiatric Center , worked together with a psychiatric team from Mackay Memorial Hospital to evaluate the emotional state of the victims .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
Urbanization has also made interactions between people more complex . Some of the psychological problems of modern people are not like those of the past , which were comprehensible to the average person . For this reason , more people have been going to see psychological counselors over the last few years . The numbers of people waiting to see a doctor in the psychiatric wards of hospitals or at institutions which provide psychological care provide ample evidence of this .  
Hayashi Eidai says , of the Volunteers : " Do n't be distracted by their seemingly pro-Japanese public appearance , sometimes dressed in Japanese uniforms , with Japanese caps , and singing Japanese army songs . As soon as they had a drink it was not at all unknown for them to start cursing the Japanese for being heartless and immoral , and damning Japanese imperialism . " Clearly , the Volunteers carry heavy psychological baggage from the war .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
He explains : " From both the psychiatric literature and clinical experience , doctors discovered that there 's a peculiar phenomenon with people suffering psychological disorders . Once they 're in hospital , the disorders can be controlled quite well , but when they return home , not long thereafter the symptoms re-emerge . " Doctors thus became curious about the family backgrounds of their patients , and social workers were sent to investigate . The result has been the discovery of many dysfunctional families .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
When you first hear the term " art therapy , " it seems very mysterious . But in fact , art therapy is one kind of psychological therapy and like any other psychological therapy , its object can be differentiated based on health status ( the mentally ill and those with non-clinical mental health problems ) , on age ( children , adolescents , the middle-aged , the elderly ) , on type of illness , or stage of illness ( early , terminal ) , on patterns of behavior ( smokers , non-smokers ) and so forth .  
Dance therapists find that the same activity will be expressed in various ways . Some patients act like a bionic man with extraordinary strength , possibly showing violent tendencies . Some appear to move effortlessly , as if they were light as feather . In each case the movement is a reflection of the patient 's current psychological state .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
According to Cheng , research in Taiwan and abroad has consistently demonstrated that severe depression , alcohol and drug addiction , psychological instability and personality disorders , and suicidal behavior by close blood relatives are all clear contributing factors to suicide . Moreover , Dr . George Brown , a fellow of the British Academy , stresses that the experience of loss events also plays a decisive role as a catalyst for suicide .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
To this end , in October 2003 the center established the Suicide Prevention Center . It also appointed " informers " in police bureaus , fire brigades , and neighborhood hospitals to build a protection net . As soon as the center receives an attempted suicide report from an emergency ward , it tries to conduct a thoroughgoing follow-up and to provide psychological counseling to the patient to prevent another suicide attempt .  
She begins by developing their understanding of their bodies through drawing their genitals , giving self-evaluations , charting menstrual cycles , learning to put on a condom , and studying other contraceptive methods before moving on to the psychological side with work on self-affirmation and interpersonal relations . Ultimately , she asks the students to confront the issues of birth , aging , illness and death by having them interview elderly persons , share their feelings about caring for grandparents who have been the victims of strokes , and write a living will .

Mrs . BEZLEPKINA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the period of reorientation resulting from Russia 's adoption of democratic values and ideals the country 's internal resources were strained and its people were struggling with a falling standard of living .

Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;
