There were also those who considered that , in view of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the profound and far-reaching changes that have transformed the international security landscape since the end of the cold war era , and the advent of a new century , profitable use could be made of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to review and assess progress towards the " grand vision " and programme of action of the Final Document .

Indeed , at its nineteenth special session , devoted to the consideration of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly stressed that in order to promote participatory processes in the area of economic and social development , the participation of national legislative assemblies was indispensable .  
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .

At the coordination segment of the Council of 1995 , devoted to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the Council decided that it would ensure the harmonization and coordination of the agendas and work programmes of the functional commissions by promoting a clearer division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them ( thirteenth paragraph of agreed conclusions 1995 / 1 ) .  
With regard to the financial management of resources devoted to NGOs , ACC members agree with the need for a better accounting and reporting procedure , however they are not convinced that the resulting ability to produce comparative statistics will be particularly useful , since the operating budgets of organizations and agencies are very different and their individual needs in terms of cooperation with NGOs are fully adapted to their respective roles and mandates .  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .

Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
The Advisory Committee also devoted considerable attention to extrabudgetary funds in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,9 where it addressed the presentation of information on trust funds in the budget document , the primacy of United Nations regulations and rules with regard to any conditions attached to special purpose contributions and the need for a standard format and procedures for reporting on trust funds to donors with a view to reducing the administrative burden and excessive overheads .  
This initiative is designed to deal with the various facets of the grave phenomenon of arms proliferation , which besides draining vast resources that could be devoted to the social and economic development of our peoples constitutes the most dangerous threat to the peace and security of the world .  
In this respect , the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international drug control , which is to be held in June 1998 , will provide us with an excellent opportunity to renew our political commitment by closing our ranks against illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for progress in preventive efforts .  
The ministerial meeting of the Security Council devoted to Africa , held on the commendable initiative of the United States last 25 September , led to a fruitful exchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of the international community to become more actively , more significantly and more concretely involved in a new type of partnership with Africa in order to contribute to its development .  
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;

The General Assembly of the United Nations has also stated that equal attention and urgent consideration should be devoted to the realization , promotion and protection of both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere .

Boutros Boutros-Ghali , for the positions he has taken and for his constant and devoted endeavours to advance the cause of the Palestinian people and to support its strategic choice with regard to the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in our region .  
It was argued , moreover , that the text failed to embody important principles such as the sovereign right of States to exploit their own natural resources according to their own policies , the concept of common but differentiated responsibility and the international consensus on the right to development ; it was also considered unfortunate that none of the draft articles had been devoted specifically to the need for an overall balance between environmental and developmental imperatives .

Given the recognized and authentic relationship which exists between disarmament and development and because it is immoral and unacceptable to squander resources on armaments while the needs of billions of human beings so unsatisfied , the final document resulting from the first special session devoted to disarmament , held in 1978 , included various references to the question in its paragraphs 16 , 35 , 89 , 94 and 95 .  
Furthermore , our feelings of incredulity and indignation are accompanied by the conviction that many of the economic and social problems which overwhelm and cause distress to the majority of human beings could be alleviated in considerable measure if only a fraction of the resources devoted to military expenditures were utilized for the noble objective of the progress and well-being of the peoples of the world .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .

All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .
