The Bush camp was obviously unhappy about Clinton 's " little tricks . "  Even though Bush could promulgate new administrative decrees to overturn the old ones , Bush , who has advertised himself as a " sympathetic conservative , " could counter opposition and lose public support if he tries to make major changes .  This is because Clinton 's administrative decrees involve mainly environmental protection and safety of work venues .

This is a hard battle and a declaration of an all-out war against the dark and evil forces .  It is also a vigorous test for the public security organs : in order to crack down , first the problem has to be faced squarely , the " protective umbrella " for the dark and evil forces has to be uncovered , and the intertwining network of connections has to be destroyed ;

We have to clearly recognize that the reason why the dark and evil forces can be so rampant in some localities is exactly because extremely few public security personnel or even government officials are acting as their " protective umbrella . "  This is an important factor which can not be overlooked in the struggle of " hitting the mob and eliminating devils " .  
As a rule , such U.S . official " human rights reports " flagrantly criticize the human rights situations in other countries .

Shortly afterwards , the local public security organs at all levels downloaded all sorts of information relating to the prime suspect from a specialized website created by the Ministry of Public Security , so that the broad masses of public security officers and men involved in this struggle quickly learned all details and accurate information relating to the prime suspect and information relating to investigations into the case as well , and this provided solid support for cracking the vicious " 16 March " explosion case in Shijiazhuang City .  
If we further analyze the reason why the effective running of the Western congressional system is commensurate with the social conditions of social pluralism in the West , we will find that multiparty politics goes in line with the pluralistic state of aggregate public opinion distribution .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
Over the past few years , the public security organs have adopted resolute measures to " strike at triad activities or weed out local tyrants ; " have ruthlessly cracked down on all types of illegal or criminal activities by cracking one batch of major or serious cases after another or rounding up in the net of law one criminal guilty of flagrant crimes after another ; and have thereby upheld justice , deterred crimes , or maintained social stability .  
The public security organs across the country should adhere to the principle of striking hard by ruthlessly cracking down on all types of criminal activities in accordance with the law .  At the moment , we should especially concentrate on cracking down on crimes of extreme violence , organized crimes , drug-related crimes , gun-related crimes , or explosive-related crimes and should resolutely weed out all criminal elements swollen with arrogance .  
This is so because , first , radical and emotional nationalism directly appeals to " first principles of survival " and attacks all dissenting voices as threats to national survival ; in this way , it attempts to exclusively occupy intellectual and public opinion commanding heights , so as to become the dominant speech prevailing over all other human values and the virtual " supreme command . "  
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .

The CSRC requested that based on the requirements contained in this guidance securities companies conduct a review of the lead underwriting they have done in the year 2000 for initial public offering , additional issues of stock , and allotments by listed companies .

We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .

It was decided at the meeting that beginning from now till the end of next year , public security organs throughout the country should , in close conjunction with the fighting goal set by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on striving to achieve a conspicuous improvement in public order within two years , immediately launch a vigorous and forceful nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that by making arrangements for unfolding a nationwide struggle to " strike hard " and put things right , the national public order work conference fully expressed the strong resolve of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to preserve social and political stability and the fundamental interests of the masses , and this will have a major and far-reaching impact on ensuring the smooth progress of China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization and achieving lasting political stability in the country .  
The economic and trade commissions at all levels must fullyunderstand the important significance of rectifying and standardizing marketeconomic order from the high plane of intensifying the work of public order , solidifying and developing the good momentum of national economic development , heightening the overall quality and competitiveness of the national economy , further opening wider to the outside world , and establishing and perfecting thesocialist market economic structure .

"  
From his election campaign , Bush was bent on pursuing a foreign policy different from that of the Clinton administration , and behaved in a hawkish style on many events to win support from the American public .  This time , shortly after the occurrence of the plane collision incident , he immediately selected the option of making a tough-worded statement on an open occasion , rather than dialing a phone call to Beijing .  
Liang Guoju , director of the provincial Public Security Department of Guangdong , called a special teleconference the other day to lay out tasks for public security organs throughout the province ; meanwhile , he urged all localities across the province to publicize in the coming few days each 's results in the comprehensive management of local social security , including the number of criminal rings of an underworld triad nature and the number of suspects that each locality had successfully smashed and arrested .  
At an earlier time , the authorities also issued a directive , urging the public to come forward and inform against lawbreakers .  Public security organs have already set up special hotlines and email boxes for tip-offs ; at the same time , they have also called on suspects to turn themselves in order to secure a lenient treatment from the police .  
International public opinion has focused on the fact that in this book approved by the Japanese Government , the " New History Textbook Writing Committee " has , under the slogan of making some " corrections to Japanese history textbooks ' tendency toward national abuse , " distorted historical facts and completely whitewashed its invasive war , denying the serious crimes that Japan committed during World War II . Although the manuscript was revised 137 times , its contents are still far from historical fact .  
In actuality , during the 1980s , given the pressure of strong public opinion assigning blame for the history books , the Japanese Government was obligated to set a neighboring countries clause in terms of its textbooks , promising these countries that the textbook question would begin from the point of view of obtaining international understanding and international cooperation , and would be given the necessary review and reflection .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
From China 's northern borders where spring is much in the air to southern China where trees are turning green and from the coastal areas where the ground is full of fallen flowers to the headstreams of the Chang Jiang and Huang He where snow and ice begin to thaw , the public securities organizations have taken rapid actions to form a huge and comprehensive anti-crime network .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
At the mass rally to openly mete out punishments to a batch of serious criminals in Chongqing Municipality , the public security bureau announced the arrests of 92 members of criminal gangs bearing the character of the Mafia , despotic hooligans , and suspected criminals in some serious cases , and announced administrative detentions of six suspected criminals .  
Central government organs and departments have held meetings one after another in the last few days to implement the spirit of the national conference on public order work and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech ; took active actions ; made arrangements for the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order ; and done an earnest job of rectifying and standardizing market economic order in close connection with the realities in reform and development .

After the Chinese Government announced the release of the plane crew , raging public feelings immediately appeared on the Internet . Many Internet users posted articles to express their dissatisfaction over the government for " making a concession " to the United States . Some users even posted strong words on the " Renminwang , " such as " Li Hongzhang returns from the grave ; " " Ah Q style of victory ; " " The government is too weak , it has brought disgrace upon us . "  
Nevertheless , in each of their public statements , Chi Haotian and Zhang Wannian described themselves as " acting at President Jiang 's behest . "  The decision to release the crew before the Easter holiday was obviously influenced by suggestions made by the diplomatic system , and the timing was accurately controlled .  As demonstrated here , the PRC 's internal decision-making is rather rational , and Jiang Zemin is secure in his place as the commander .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  
We must fully understand the importance and urgency of doing a good job of public security work , earnestly implement the " strike hard " principle and various measures for comprehensive management of social security , which were formulated by the central authorities , and create a sound social environment for the state 's long-term political stability and economic development .  
To do a good job of the work of improving public order and maintaining stability , we must persist in advancing the work in a comprehensive way , while placing great stress on key areas and concentrating forces on solving pronounced problems and main contradictions with good results , and advance the overall situation of work by making breakthroughs in key areas .

The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .

In order to firmly adhere to the policy of dealing " sure , accurate and relentless " blows to criminals , procuratorial and public security organizations in Chongqing and Changde made prompt preparations even in the investigation period .  Those organizations assigned key and capable personnel to investigate and detect cases in several provinces .  Public security organizations also quickly handed over cases to procuratorial organizations .

In recent years , people at the grass-roots level have reacted to related issues on a growing scale and at an increasing speed in their expression of opinions and sentiments .  Naturally national sentiments constitute an important part of their reaction , and we would be overlooking the spontaneous side of public opinion by dismissing it as manipulation by top Chinese communist leaders .  
His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .

Luo Gan pointed out : Since the national conference on public order work was held in April , localities have attached great importance to and conscientiously implemented the important speech of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the spirit of the conference , taken swift actions and struck severe blows at Mafia-style criminal gangs in larger numbers , catching a great number of felons in the net of justice .  The masses of the people clapped and cheered at all these achievements .  
The " strike-hard " struggle is developing in intensity in all localities , public security organs at all levels are effectively cracking down on crimes , and initial results have been obtained in the special action to " prevent explosions and seize guns " and in other special actions .  A large quantity of illegally possessed firearms and ammunition were seized and destroyed , thus eliminating a hidden danger to public order , and a number of criminal gangs have been ferreted out .

The Guangdong Command has successively contributed a total of 3,219 man-times .

A total of 6,737 suspects , including 318 sinister criminals and 47 chieftains of quasi criminal-syndicate gangs , were arrested , 2 hostages were rescued , and 153 guns , 953 bullets and 927 grams of heroin were seized .  
According to the incomplete estimates of the departments concerned , at present the armed police units , in coordination with the public security organs , have smashed nearly 1,000 sinister and evil gangs and arrested tens of thousands of criminals .  They have thus demonstrated the strength of the police force and given prominence to what is right .  This has held the sinister and evil forces deeply in awe and dealt a blow to their arrogance .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
After the national work conference on public security was held , public security border guards have taken measures to speedily launch the " strike-hard " rectification struggle , and severely crack down on cross-border criminal activities such as stowing away , smuggling , guns running , and drug trafficking , thus making positive contributions to safeguarding social and public stability in both border and coastal regions .  
The party committee of the Ministry of Public Security 's Frontier Guard Administrative Bureau has attached great importance to launching the " strike-hard " struggle .  To solidly and efficiently launch the " strike-hard " struggle , the bureau has established a frontier guard " strike-hard " leading group .  Various public security frontier guard headquarters have also established " strike-hard " leading groups headed by principal military and administrative officials .  
In this grand " strike-hard " struggle , public security frontier guards throughout the country have stressed their tasks in striking out at illegal migration .  They have formed a tight preventive line along the coastal regions and in ports to strike at the activities on " sea , land , and air . "  
Severely striking out at gun running and drug trafficking is a key task in the public security frontier guards ' " strike-hard " struggle .  Frontier guards stationed in China 's southwestern border areas , including Yunnan and Guangxi , have concentrated their efforts on destroying gun smuggling and drug trafficking gangs , cutting off entry points for gun and drug smuggling , and severely punishing the criminal elements who are involved in exceptionally large gun and drug smuggling .  They have speedily launched their special actions to crack down on guns and drugs .

Compelled by public opinion at home and abroad , the textbook that in April had been determined to be " up to standard " by the Japanese Ministry for Education , Culture , Sports , Science , and Technology , had several thousand errors revised recently .  However , the revision avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial .  Descriptions that distort history and beautify aggression have not been revised , and the textbook still adopts the basic theme of advocating the " historical view of the Japanese Empire . "  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
Li Donghai pointed out that in the past year the Taiwan authorities refusing to acknowledge the one China principle and sparing no efforts to deny the " 1992 consensus " reached by the two associations has led to a worsening and deterioration of cross-strait relations , and has also led to Taiwan being in a constant state of chaos .

As a matter of fact , in analyzing the major cause to the chaotic political situation in Taiwan , the public opinion and some political and academic figures on the island pointed out in the same way without prior consultation : First , in the past year since the leader of the Taiwan authorities took office , he has not taken actual measures to relax and improve cross-strait relations and to dispel the people 's misgiving about his seeking " Taiwan independence " and this has caused the Taiwan society to have an unstable external environment .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
While the economic situation on the island is poor and the public eagerly look forward to being lifted out of depression and seeing unemployment mitigated , the Taiwan authorities have found a little " comfort " in the changeable international climate and impatiently jumped on the bandwagon of " containing China " of the international anti-China forces .  
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government leaders , including Jia Qinglin , fully reaffirmed the public security organs ' special campaigns and public order rectification work that mainly aimed to crack down on criminal underworld and evil elements , and that also aimed to severely crack down on serious violent crimes , repeated financial crimes , neighborhood crimes , and drug-related crimes .  
The relevant reports quote senior officials in Beijing as saying that US arms sales to Taiwan , the air collision incident , and public expression of the policy of defending Taiwan by force since Bush took office have caused certain people in the new Taiwan authorities to develop unrealistic illusions , holding that the mainland will not dare to settle the Taiwan problem by force and that even if Taiwan is independent , the mainland will not run the risk of starting a war with the United States in order to launch an armed attack on Taiwan .

The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
Governments at all levels and various government departments should make the basic interests of the masses of people the starting point of all work and take effective measures to solve difficult problems of universal concern to the masses of people .  At present , we should do the following three tasks well : first , it is necessary to effectively strengthen public security work and to go all out to safeguard social and political stability .  
First , as " the Le-cheng Program " is a highly confidential program involving top secrets , Taiwan 's military has had to implement the program without mentioning it in public , and Taiwan 's officers and men involved in the program also know very little about it .

It also believes the pro-unification forces , which once had the legal basis and rationality on their side , have basically lost their public identity .

Events of the past year have shown that the roots of the tense cross-strait relations have not been and could not be removed .  
Echoing and colluding with each other , the Dalai clique and the international hostile forces are returning favor with favor in their efforts to incite disturbances , plot explosions , and distribute reactionary leaflets and anonymous letters to viciously attack the principles and policies implemented by the party and state in Tibet and build up public opinion in the international community in a vain attempt to make the Tibet issue a hot spot of attention to the world public opinion .  
Since reform , the rural economy has undergone substantial adjustment .  However , the public ownership system still holds a dominant position , with farm output quotas being set for each household , and land , which is the primary means of production for agriculture , continuing to be publicly owned .  
Since S-2T antisubmarine aircraft still remain Taiwan Navy 's principal antisubmarine arms , in order to avoid publicly exposing Taiwan 's naval strength , the Control Yuan has decided not to make public its document and a relevant investigation report , both of which have been classified as " secret .

We should persist in arming people with scientific theories , guiding people with correct public opinions , molding people with a noble spirit and encouraging people with outstanding art and literature works .  
We should strive for diversification of property rights through multiple forms , such as standard public listing of companies , mutual purchase of shares by legal persons , domestic natural person investment , foreign investment , conversion of bank credits rights to equity , market share subscription , stock right transaction , and the holding of shares by employees of a company , and gradually establish and improve a standard system of corporate governance .

However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .

Today , the Ministry of Public Security gave a report to some members of the National People 's Congress standing committee based in Beijing and members of the relevant NPC special committees on how the public security organs nationwide have been implementing the spirit of the 13th session of the ninth NPC standing committee , strengthening the building of the public security contingent , and , in particular , conducting " three educations " since the beginning of 2000 .  
By way of conducting all kinds of specialized improvement activities , some outstanding problems in the public security contingent have been resolved , the law-enforcing behavior of the people 's police has been standardized , the image and mental outlook of the contingent have shown rather manifest changes , and its overall quality and operational effectiveness have been greatly enhanced .  
In this way we can form and develop a positive and upward-looking public opinion environment throughout society , enable scientific theory and correct ideology to play the dominant role in social life activities , enable the cadres and masses to maintain good spiritual features , and continually consolidate and develop the basis of the common ideal of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in their united endeavors .  
We must continue to uphold the guideline of unity , stability , and drive , and of focusing on propaganda by positive example , propagate in depth patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , further do a good job in publicizing typical examples , providing guidance for hot topics , and carrying out public opinion supervisory work , support healthy practices and eliminate unhealthy ones , boost people 's spirit , and encourage people to strive ever upward .  
The DPP 's governing performance shows that the authorities have politically gone against the trend of the times and economically triggered a decline or recession ; enterprises , capital , or qualified personnel have kept migrating abroad ; and the mainland has become the third most ideal destination for Taiwan migrants , and this shows that over the past half a year or more , the public has gradually grown disillusioned with the DPP and has seen more clearly that pursuing Taiwan independence is likely to bring a threat to Taiwan 's security .  
The " Yining incident " occurred on 5 February 1997 , when nearly 1,000 young Uygurs held a march in Yining demanding that the government authorities release a number of young Uygurs arrested for writing an antigovernment article ; the march turned into a riot , with the young Uygurs shouting Xinjiang independence slogans and attacking Chinese and setting fire to the bodies of Chinese they had beaten to death ; large numbers of public security personnel and armed police came out to suppress them , and calm was eventually restored next day .  
He asked various units to work in close coordination , give full play to the advantage of joint struggle of all public security organizations , consider the work of tracing and arresting criminal suspects as a special task , make overall and proper arrangements , and strive to achieve practical results .  
The two governments and the two peoples always respect each other , understand each other , and support each other .  Cooperation between the two sides in the political , economic , public health , cultural , educational , and other fields has been continuously expanding .  In particular , high-level visits were exchanged more frequently between the two countries , and bilateral exchanges increased .  
The ulterior motive of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult in spreading rumors to confuse the public , breaking the law and creating trouble is to create chaos and social disorder in China , disrupt people 's normal work , study and daily life , and interfere with the central task of economic development , so that they can realize their political aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Chinese communist party and changing China 's socialist system .  
However , because of his complex social relations and numerous hatchet men , the public security department adopted a cautious approach by establishing a special committee , adopted high-tech means , and deployed several special agents to conduct the investigation under absolute secrecy for nearly one year to collect concrete evidence .  
The special police contingent of the criminal police corps of the Beijing municipal public security bureau is a specialized force formed in view of Beijing 's development into an international metropolis .  
While inspecting the contingent 's vehicles and other equipment , Luo Gan said : In cracking criminal cases , the public security people 's police usually faces extremely cruel criminals ; therefore , our criminal and special police forces should be very competent and skillful and well equipped in order to ensure that the enemy is most forcefully dealt with and they themselves are most effectively protected .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
As briefed by public security organs , the content of the confiscated illegal publicity materials included materials to publicize false reasoning and heresies of " Falungong " heretical cult , to instigate people to violate laws and create disturbances , and to viciously spread rumors to slander against the government and state leaders .  
The quality and efficiency of economic growth was markedly improved , financial revenue also increased by a big margin , the readjustment of the economic structure was being actively advanced , and reforms in all aspects were being carried forward in depth .  The scope of opening up to the outside world was further expanded .  Comprehensive development was made in the fields of science and technology , education , culture , public health , sports , and all other social undertakings .  
The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
Faced with this fact of utterly inhuman brutality , one has no choice but to become more vigilant and understand better the nature and harm of " Falun Gong " as an antihuman , antisocial , and antiscience cult .  The central people 's government 's adopting stern measures to ban it is not only entirely necessary and timely , but also accords with the most fundamental interests of the general public .  
First , give priority to preventing , cracking down hard , and punishing corruption in the antigraft , discipline inspection , procuratorate , supervisory , court , auditing , judicial , customs , public security , armed police , and army systems ; since these are state dictatorship organs , on the one hand the state has to ensure that they " eat imperial grain , " and on the other hand the state demands that they must fairly enforce the law and ensure honest government .  This is the precondition for opposing corruption in China .  
He pointed out : Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " evil cult have become a political tool of the Western anti-China forces .  To achieve their sinister political purpose , they spread fallacies to hoodwink the public again and again , instigated diehard " Falungong " members to incite mob disturbances again and again .  Now , they even took more desperate actions and went as far as driving obsessed followers to commit suicide .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
We should further intensify comprehensive management of public order , crack down hard on various criminal activities in accordance with the law , and wage a special struggle against " triads and evil forces , " with the focus on homicide , explosion , and gun-related grave violence crimes and gang crimes , as well as serious economic crimes .  
The comrades engaged in publicizing political and legal affairs and the comprehensive management of public order must solidly foster their political consciousness , as well as their awareness about the overall situation , responsibility , and position , continue to persist in highlighting the main trend , and uphold the predominance of unity , stability , exertion of efforts , and positive publicity in order to create a good public opinion atmosphere for reform , development , and the maintenance of stability .  
Leading comrades in charge of the work of publicizing political and legal affairs and the comprehensive management of public order in the party committees and the political and legal affairs commissions of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the central government , as well as the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps ; leading officials of the relevant units and departments of the Central Commission for the Comprehensive Management of Public Order ; and leading officials of the relevant departments of all major central news units were present at the meeting .  
Presenting a work report at the Fourth Session of the Ninth Sichuan Provincial People 's Congress , Han Zhongxin said : The Sichuan Provincial People 's Procuratorate resolutely dealt with crimes committed by public functionaries last year .  For the grand development of China 's west , it has made active efforts to create an environment for fair , clean , and efficient social management and social service .  
By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .  Their organizational activities and roles in society are despised by all normal religious organizations that preach good deeds to people .  
It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday . He said he did not mean Taiwan need not deploy the TMD , and he thought because Taiwan is close to the mainland , the early warning time is short , and even if Taiwan has a complete missile defense system , it still can not intercept so many short-range missiles from the other side of the Taiwan Strait .  
Mutually beneficial cooperation has been carried out and expanded gradually in the economic and trade , scientific and technological , cultural and education , and public health fields , and has achieved positive results .  
An ironic fact was that some local people even tried to " pick a bone from an egg " by taking advantage of Ma Ying-jeou 's visit to Hong Kong . They argued that the Hong Kong general public 's strong interest in Ma Ying-jeou 's visit was not derived from their concern about the motherland 's reunification and Hong Kong 's urban construction , but was derived from their interest in " seeing the mayor being elected democratically in Chinese society . "  
It is learned that running television stations in the name of the government is not a rare phenomenon in the townships and towns around Lankao and Dongming .

Answer : Generally speaking , they will have to prepare themselves in the following three ways : First , they should change their rules governing trading in the B shares and make public on an earlier date concrete measures for mainland investors with legitimate foreign exchange funds to open a B-share account and a capital account ;  
Gao Changli was placed under the " double rules " because he took it upon himself to print quotations from Jiang Zemin ( purported to be distributed to all judicial officials across the country ) in his hometown in Shandong and because he illegally appropriated several Justice Ministry housing units for its public functionaries .  In addition to that , however , the most important reason was because he refused to sign the documents concerning the extradition of Lai Changxing , the principal suspect in Xiamen 's Yuanhua smuggling case who has escaped abroad .  
Furthermore , the relevant department has conducted the following special rectification on a large scale : Straightening out electricity charges ; standardizing payments of charges for railroad , traffic , and public security services ; stopping arbitrary ranking , arbitrary evaluations , and arbitrary inspections ; rectifying intermediary service charges ; curbing arbitrary collections of charges from foreign-invested enterprises ; bringing order out of arbitrary collections of charges related to traffic and vehicles ; and reducing town and township enterprises ' burden .

"  
He openly defied the laws , organized and instigated besieging of party and government organs and mass media institutions , staged illegal demonstrations and rallies , continuously gathered his followers at Tiananmen Square to carry out trouble-making activities , seriously disrupted the public order and sabotaged social stability .  
Talking about the relationship between handling Falungong and guaranteeing human rights , Liu said : The policy of the Chinese government in handling the Falungong problem is to unite with , educate , and saving most of the practitioners who have been deceived .  The Chinese government has punished a small handful of people in the Falungong cult because they have engaged in illegal and criminal activities , disrupted public order , and violated the Chinese law .  
At a news briefing held today by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and Ministry of Supervision , Yuan Chunqing , member of the standing committee , secretary general , and spokesman of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , briefed reporters on the party and administrative disciplinary actions taken against Li Jizhou , former vice minister of public security and former deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , and against other party members and state workers involved in the Xiamen extraordinarily large-scale smuggling case .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
A historical document made available to the public for the first time here shows that in 1945 after victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan , a representative of the then Chinese Government officially accepted the entire land and administrative right of Taiwan from the Japanese colonialists , who were occupying Taiwan at that time , thereby once again proving that Taiwan is part of China and that the so-called " theory on Taiwan 's undecided status " is basically untenable .  
In the recent period , Falungong has intensified its activities of disturbing and infiltrating Hong Kong society .  Besides putting up huge advertising posters in bustling downtown areas to propagate the Falungong cult , they also go to public places , or go from door to door and deep into residential areas , to forcefully distribute leaflets to residents .  They also rampantly send e-mail to the public .  
As pointed out by Regina Ip , the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa is no ordinary organization .  Besides being heretical and making people obsessed , it is also a tightly built organization with strong mobilization power and financial resources and is targeting itself directly at the central authorities .  Its activities have caused public concern , and it is also necessary for the government to pay attention to their activities .  
Representatives of central committees of various democratic parties ; All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , nonparty personages , and China 's five major religions as well as some special committees of the CPPCC have separately held discussion meetings to roundly expose and criticize the cult essence and various crimes of the " Falungong . " They support the government 's crack down on cults in accordance with the law to eliminate public nuisance and engage in firm struggles against the " Falungong " in various ways .  
in the context of public ownership as the main body , we must steadfastly develop economic sectors under varied ownerships , which is conducive to fully mobilizing and using social resources and boosting the vitality of the national economy as a whole , as they make up an integral party of the socialist market economy .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .

This afternoon , members of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultation Conference [ CPPCC ] from the educational circle and the medical and public health circle held a joint group meeting .  Several committee members expressed their opinions on the current situation of public health in China , pointing out that China 's current public health conditions are extremely incompatible with the country 's status and socialist system , and should be effectively and rapidly improved .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
equipment is obsolete and outmoded ; technical and professional human resources are insufficient .  The unreasonable distribution of public health resources in rural areas has affected the development of public health undertakings in the vast countryside .  
We stress the importance of unleashing and developing productive forces and building an advanced culture , but the purpose of all this is , in the final analysis , to realize , develop , and safeguard the people 's interests and continuously meet the ever-increasing material and cultural demands of the general public .  
The motion was advanced by the 114 deputies of the Anhui delegation to the NPC session .  It holds that , at this critical moment when tax for fees reform and regulating funds for public undertakings in rural areas will be fully carried out , it is imperative to establish a system for sharing compulsory education funds between the central and local authorities according to a certain proportion in order to prevent peasants ' excessive burden and consolidate the results of the trial of tax for fees reform at selected places .

In some fields , reforms have just be started .  
It is necessary to adhere to the basic economic system where public ownership is the main form of ownership and various sectors under diverse forms of ownership can develop together .  In accordance with the requirement of entering some areas while pulling out of others , we should let the state sector gravitate toward important industries and key fields that affect the lifeline of the national economy and further strengthen the control and dominance of the state sector in the national economy through the rational flow and optimized disposition of assets .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "

This will seriously impair the effective operation of the Committee in future .

In view of the economic situation , the Housing Authority has not adjusted its public housing rents since 1998 .  The rents for many flats are still at 1995 levels .  Arising from other factors such as the sale and redevelopment of housing estates and the allocation of larger flats , the current median rent-to-income ratio is above 10% .  However , to the extent that this phenomenon has arisen not as a direct consequence of rental adjustments , the Housing Authority has not broken the law .  
The need and reasonableness of an across-the-board cut is doubtful .  The Housing Authority 's current measure to re-assess the rent for individual commercial tenant according to commercial principles can better reflect the reality and help needy tenants maintain their competitiveness .  Rental reductions will not benefit shop tenants which have been enjoying prosperous business .  If so , this would be a waste of public funds .  
As I have emphasized , public housing rental levels reflect the level of subsides for public housing provided by the general public .  How to balance the different interests and how best to utilize limited social resources call for collective wisdom .  I welcome the concern expressed by Members and the public on housing policy matters .  I sincerely hope that Members will come forward with constructive views to help the Government formulate and implement housing policies that meet the needs of our citizens .  
1 .  High-stake public examination for the purpose of allocating S1 places is not necessary during the nine years of free and universal basic education .

The highest single rental of $ 3,810 is in respect of a public rental flat converted from an Home Ownership Scheme ( HOS ) flat of over 60 square metres including a master suite and other HOS facilities .

Secondly , the HA 's Rent Assistance Scheme cuts by half the rentals paid by families whose financial positions suddenly deteriorate .  Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .

To meet the needs of new arrivals , the residence requirements for allocation of public rental housing have been relaxed .  Only half of the applicant 's household members are now required to have at least seven years ' residence in Hong Kong upon flat allocation .

The land lots owned by HA account for about 73.3 per cent of the total amalgamated area .  Had the HA not taken the initiative to redevelop NPE , the potential of this prime site would not have been released for the benefit of the entire community .  The reason is that the public transport interchange and open space are earmarked as GIC and recreational use respectively in the outline zoning plan , rendering the present development potential of these two sites to be minimal .

In the U . S . , the three main TV networks have similar programs , such as " Issues &amp; Answers " on ABC , " Meet the Press " on NBC , and " Face the Nation " On CBS . Government officials in the Republic of China have often appeared on TV , but in most cases they made speeches in a stiff , official manner and confined themselves to formal announcements and outlines rather than giving " inside information " of real interest to the public .  
The organizers were greatly encouraged by the warm response from the public . To further enhance the Golden Horse Awards ceremony toward international status , the GIO has decided to enlarge its scope again next year .

Fresh seafood is arranged in front of Temple Entrance restaurants , where the customers can select their own seafood and have it prepared to their taste . Others may prefer to buy spring rolls , rice cakes , curry or noodle dishes , tempura , or oyster omelets at the smaller stands , and top them off with a dessert of traditional sweets or luscious pre-cut fruits . Keelung , whether by means of bright new public construction or traditional local color , has managed to overcome the original drab appearance caused by its rainy weather .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
The first performance in 1978 was well-received . By showing their creative and expressive talents , the deaf performers gave the public a new impression , and exposed it to their own silent language . In 1981 the Ministry of Education went a step further to promote a unified sign language .  
According to Time Magazine wind surfing captured top honors in the hearts of the public . Popularized during the 1970s in the recreation-conscious West , this stimulating sport has grown to the point where over 5 million people claim to be active participants . Not confined by demographics , this hybrid variation on sailing and surfing has made its way onto the island province of Taiwan , capturing the fancy of avid water sports enthusiasts everywhere .  
This year , too , we are lowering personal and corporate income taxes , reducing tariffs , further relaxing restrictions on foreign investment , and increasing public investment , while the 14 major development projects will be moving from the planning stage into that of actual construction .  
The 1987 Taiwan economic construction plan approved by the Executive Yuan , which foresees the attainment of an eight percent growth rate , includes many policies and measures , among which particularly to be stressed is that , besides maintaining an appropriate increase in exports , domestic demand must also be expanded , including raising the private willingness to invest and expanding public investment , thereby making domestic demand and export trade the two main forces for economic growth .  
A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 . These adjustments must take into account the factors of price fluctuations , financial liability capabilities , and the general salary levels of the people . They have no relation whatsoever to the level of foreign exchange reserves .  
If local people are responsible for some mistake , a foreign administrator had best not make an issue of it in public , or the perceived assault is liable to boomerang as one is labelled a " racist . "  
In the social sciences , economics and public finance are the most promising departments , while the continued rise of the population 's median age will mean an increased demand for social workers to provide services for the elderly . However , limitations on the number of candidates who can pass the bar examinations make law a rather " cold " field .  
The premier stated that the Taiwan region has a prosperous society and a well-to-do way of life , but that owing to rapid economic growth , the increase of the population , and the swift spread of urbanization , the environmental protection measures and the related public infrastructure of the area have been hard put to remain adequate to the needs of the times .  
Generally , after the rise of a middle class , a society 's expectations of its government are raised , so that the public of an advanced democratic nation is often evenly divided in its satisfaction with government performance , and a seventy or eighty percent satisfaction rate like some of ours is no longer easily attained .  
Universities in West Germany , on the other hand , are all public and , along with their good social welfare system , tuition free . Foreign students are also entitled to the same treatment . However , the time factor involved for getting a master 's degree can be long and drawn out . It 's not uncommon to spend five years in the process .  
The Ministry of Education has made the following revisions : Now , students who have graduated from a public or private high school , or any higher level of education , or passed the Higher Civil Service Examination or Junior-Grade Civil Service Examination and has completed his military duty , or those who are exempt from military duty , may apply to study abroad .  
Because of many years of a stable social environment and many years in the role of ruling party , a trend of " party bureaucratization " was inevitably formed . From now on , we must choose cadres from among the general public , and evaluate cadres on the basis of their actual service work , correct misconceptions on the part of cadres , and set cadres with incorrect attitudes straight .  
One of the real contributions of this congress was to establish a process for the input of public opinion through the nominating system for the Central Committee , for which half the nominees were selected by the chairman and half by petition among the delegates . The vote was by secret ballot of all the delegates , increasing the supervisory role of the base level vis-a-vis the center while making the latter more sensitive to the former .  
Because this meeting is to be held in Peking , the government had to carefully weigh the valued ties to the organization and the possible reactions of the public and academic community against the policy of no official contacts with Peking . Lien explains that " official contacts " are not thinkable , but that it was easier to allow the delegates to attend in a private capacity . However , " it is hard to say " if this is a precedent .  
Without the benefit of modern architectural planning or impressive stylish theories , one or several anonymous Chinese craftsmen centuries ago fashioned the vital lines , the public spaces , and the spiritual corners of this beautiful little village .  
The Bureau of Entry and Exit in the Ministry of Interior Affairs has decided in principle to verify entry and exit permits by the method of computer barcodes instead of the visual verification system currently in effect in order to facilitate the entry and exit of compatriots from mainland China coming to Taiwan to attend funerals or visit ailing relatives as well as the entry and exit of the general public and to better guard against the surreptitious exit of economic criminals and other illegal elements from the country .  
On the other hand , however , objective social and economic conditions , the establishment of a democratic model for the populace , and the promotion of rational behavior are especially essential to democracy . As the focus of public attention , members of the Legislative Yuan will undoubtedly have an effect on society and determine whether the ROC succeeds in democratic reforms .  
In order to help pass these bills as early as possible and secure the promotion of constitutional democratic government , Government Information Office Director-General Shaw Yu-ming held a special seminar . Specialists and scholars who had neither a hand in making up the bills nor were already opposed were asked to discuss these bills from a relatively fair , objective angle , in the hopes of raising public awareness and contributing toward a consensus .  
These included : The government should increase cultural and educational investment , establish a complete social welfare system and robust rule of law system , and strengthen public trust and public authority . The mass media should educate society and improve social habits , and should avoid exaggerating stories .  
It only lowers art to the status of a decorative product for the enjoyment of the upper and middle classes , identifying itself with the tangible and intangible rules of the ruling class . " So Chung calls for raising public awareness over reform within the system .

Although fiercely competitive , this channel of selection and replacement assists in social integration . ( 2 ) A gradual increase in the average level of education and expertise of elected officials has helped increase the efficiency and capability of the political system . ( 3 ) Native Taiwanese have a comparatively better chance of serving in public office through elections , while mainlanders often pass through other recruitment channels .  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened . The public consensus with regard to national development is inadequate , creating confusion and differences in value concepts that have led to a deterioration in law and order , urban traffic congestion , soaring realty prices , serious environmental pollution , rampant economic speculation , insufficient recreational facilities , and a widening gap in the distribution of wealth .  
The main courses of action are : - - Holding lectures and study groups with government workers at all levels to establish correct service concepts and improve service attitudes , advancing from eliminating measures that inconvenience the public to loving and caring for them . - - Suggestions from organizations that represent the will of the people must be handled by administrative agencies on an individual basis , with a timely and effective response strictly demanded . - - Public opinion and the aspirations of the people must be viewed with importance and concern .  
Once public consciousness has been raised to a new level , then hand-in-hand , with heads held high and chests thrust forward , all the citizens of China can join in the march to the future . Before making his oral report on administration to the Executive Yuan , premier Lee Huan instructed the Government Information Office to edit a report entitled " So Proudly We Hail ! Salute to the 21st Century " . A copy of the report was given to each legislator at the time of the administrative report . .  
Through the robust and healthy development of the public broadcasting system ( PBS ) , live programs can immediately be telecast or diffused by satellite via the medium of PBS . Ordinary antenna-type TV systems will include PBS channels , which will provide the public with a high standard of programming in the arts , sports , and culture .  
Development of National EducationOur educational system has endowed the general public with the ancient Greek ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body . This has produced a source of efficient manpower , and it points out the future direction which national education should take .  
Then the quality of daily human existence for everyone will improve immeasurably as we march towards the turn of the century . . Establishing a Science CityAll our cities of today will eventually be transformed into science cities . Our economic infrastructure is based on the development of industrial science and technology . This goes hand-in-glove with the modernization of public facilities .  
Science and the fruits of science will be harmoniously integrated with human life . The modernity and completeness of its public facilities will actively promote a well-rounded existence which is pluralistic in both inspiration and application . The result will not only enhance our international image , but it will also turn us into a model of what modern living should be like . .  
By the end of this century , we must establish a complete system of laws and regulations , develop a hi-tech industrial structure , fill the gaps in modernized public facilities , carry out well-planned social security and welfare policies , and at the same time expand our particiaption in international activities . If we succeed in doing this , there is no doubt that we will create an advanced , prosperous , healthy , happy , and more balanced society in Taiwan by the year 2000 .

But the historical drama played out on this beautiful stage during the following century , in which the chief actors were the Chinese , the Dutch , the Spanish , and the Japanese , has nearly vanished into the mists of antiquity . Not only is the story little known among the general public , but the field is practically unexplored among academic researchers as well .  
Under political party competition , society has the right to ask that the parties and the candidates they put forward have a high degree of ' political responsibility ' and meet the competitive ethics of party politics , " says Kao Hui-yu , a reporter for the United Daily News . Similarly , candidates need to promote a sense of public responsibility in order to change voters ' thinking from passive mobilization into active participation .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies . It now is evident that , while the ruling party focused its efforts on central government offices and overlooked the recruitment of candidates that can win in local elections , the DPP has launched its most elite manpower at the local level , especially in races for county magistrates and city mayors .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
Attempts were made by the first director to restore the interior to its former splendour . He had seen what Victoria 's workmen had removed and was given permission by the queen to select items from the boxes in which they lay and begin returning them to the Pavilion . Yet it was an uphill struggle and by the years of World War , after such a long period of public use , which included it being used as a hospital for Indian soldiers during World War , the once splendid building had hit a new low point .  
We never thought we would buy a house in Hsichih , " says Hsiung Shu-hua , a public relations employee at Philips . She grew up in Hsichih but the place always seemed a bit of a backwater , awkward to get to and limited by its traditional rural economy , so when she got married three years ago she and her husband moved out to rented accommodation in Neihu .  
Those who finished high in the number of interpellations expressed satisfaction that their daily diligence at pursuing public policy is finally laid out for the public . Others are busy trying to defend themselves , patiently explaining to reporters why their numbers of interpellations are so low , or so biased in content toward a single side .  
With an educational credit system inherited from Europe , Australian universities used to recognize degrees from Taiwan from only a few public universities as qualifying their holders for direct admission to graduate school , but they have gradually relaxed their standards . Only a few , such as Sydney and Melbourne , are more strict and may require an oral interview or a trial year in the undergraduate program before deciding on admission .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
Their businesslike atmosphere may be less entertaining for many than the witty and aggressive question time in the Chamber , yet televising has certainly contributed to a greater public awareness of their work as well as forcing ministers and civil servants to take them more seriously . As for the problem of disorderly behavior among MPs , the presence of the cameras does seem to have actually improved their conduct .  
Brazil was an attractive enough place for immigrants then . With excellent public facilities , a free open economy and plentiful natural resources , it was a paradise offering unlimited opportunities for the immigrant with energy to spare . "  
In the late 19th century , when colleges on the East Coast were still debating whether to open their doors to the general public , Cornell already accepted students of all backgrounds - - no matter whether they were black or white , rich or poor , male or female , all were treated the same .  
According to Council for Economic Planning and Development member Wu Chia-hsing , the main reason for Korea going into the red has been fulfilment of the government 's election pledges . With the construction of two million houses in the public sector domestic demand has diverted glass , concrete and steel from exports and even led to their being imported from overseas .  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
And if you make windfall profits on speculation , then that 's just smart planning . " But the two main public policies for returning price rises to the public - - buying land up according to assessed value and taxes , also based on assessed value - - are not able to fulfill their function because of the huge gap between the standard - - assessed prices - - and the actual market prices .  
Its advantage is to reduce land speculation , and also the protests faced at the time the government claims the land will be reduced . The disadvantage is that a considerable portion of the value added to the property by new government construction will be skimmed off by the landowners , so that the ideal of " returning the value added to the public " can not be fully realized .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
Its administrative district was Taipei City , and in neighboring communities just across the bridge , an inch of land was already worth an inch of gold . But the ban on new development caused reluctance to proceed without construction of public works . Disordered , illegal constructions and dilapidated old red brick structures with leaky roofs are everywhere .  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
The 2:1 exchange rate of the Belize dollar to the U . S . dollar has held steady for many years , and inflation has been kept firmly under control - - a big relief when you consider the astronomical inflation and plummeting exchange rates of its neighbors . Immigrants from Taiwan also find it reassuring that Belize and the R . O . C . have diplomatic relations and that the economic assistance we are providing them has made us well liked by the government and public alike . "  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Hu You-huei , an associate professor of public health at the Yangming Medical College , revealed in a study that women have a higher incidence of acute , chronic , disabling , dental , and mild nervous conditions than men . "  
He satirizes feminine pettiness and cupidity , but he 's afraid to get into other areas . Playing the opposite sex is even tougher to bring off since guardians of public morality keep a close watch on the airwaves , and audiences are growing a little tired of it from overuse , what with Auntie Tung , Sister Wai , Old Lady Yang , and so forth , on practically every show . Hsiao Tung will gradually " recover his manhood " in the future , Pai Mei-hung reveals .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
The National Science Council 's Twelve-Year Plan for Scientific and Technological Development identifies its four main goals as upgrading science and technology , advancing economic development , raising the public 's quality of life and establishing an independent national defense .  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions . Making it new : Can traditional folk theater be combined with modern concepts and techniques to once again attract the attention of the public and reenter the life of the people ?  
The concept of fetal toxicosis originated in the ancients ' misunderstanding of rashes and communicable diseases . Red lead and cinnabarre still sometimes misused in Chinese medicine today , in spite of scientific evidence , resulting in heavy metal poisoning . I hope that agencies in charge of public health will extend regulation to Chinese medicine .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
In addition , when the representative group arrived in Berlin and found that the film festival 's daily publication was quite weighty , with the help of the public relations firm they made broad and friendly connections . Also , taking advantage of the timing , before the first showing of the film they invited important critics to a special preview showing .  
Yet , at present , national and communal woods of the mountain and river areas aside , there has been a longstanding lack of regulations governing the proportion of land allotted for building purposes , apart from on highways and in public parks . Development plans for residential and industrial-commercial areas still do not take into consideration the conservation and exploitation of green resources .  
To analyze the phenomenon from a sociological viewpoint , in olden times many couples were brought together by matchmakers , neither of them even knowing what the other looked like before the wedding ceremony . Thus the custom of the family invading the bridal chamber had the function of breaking down the feelings of unfamiliarity between the couple . According to anthropologist Ruan Chang-jui , it was also " a social process by which the joining of two people as one flesh was given public recognition . "  
In line with this policy the Ministry of Justice has prepared an Anti-Corruption Plan , the four main aims of which are to make public officials " afraid to be corrupt , unable to be corrupt , unwilling to be corrupt and free of the need to be corrupt . "  
Explaining these four aims , Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou says that making people afraid to be corrupt takes strict laws ; making them unable to be corrupt takes comprehensive preventive measures ; the way to make them unwilling to be corrupt is to instil in public servants a sense of honor in uprightness and shame in corruption ; and for civil servants to have no need to be corrupt depends on giving then adequate salaries , so that they can afford to stay clean , and do not need to rely on ill-gotten gains .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Actually , public and private schools have a deep connection . A few of the schools were established by retired members of the military dog training center . Also , when the police canine division was first formed , they trained both the people and the dogs by relying on the long experience of private dog schools .  
When Lin Chung-cheng , an Academia Sinica researcher in social sciences , examined the early economic differences between native Taiwanese and mainlanders , he discovered that native businesses tended to take root among the general public and situate themselves in downstream manufacturing , while mainlander businesses were mostly developing upstream supply industries which could avoid the market weakness of insufficient human resources .  
Some calculating employees could tell that my husband was n't completely in support of me . To my surprise , they conspired to make my standing worse . Sometimes in public with a lot of people around , my husband scolded me , and after he left the room the employees treated my with a cold , haughty air .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
The reception room has long been the part of the Presidential Palace that has received the greatest public exposure . Two years ago , the simple old carpet and armchairs from the frugal days of national reconstruction were replaced . Now the walls and furniture are all coordinated in a gentle cream color , and the carpet is decorated with Chinese motifs .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
In the view of Huang Chun-ming , an associate professor of architecture at Chung Yuan Christian University , they did this because they got sick of the wasted time and effort of tearing holes through the walls every time they laid a new road . They figured they might as well just tear down the whole thing , using the salvaged stone as a material for the public structures they were building .  
For example , the public is allowed to walk through the Po Ai district , but mindful of being watched , everyone 's mood naturally grows more solemn upon entering it . People talk in hushed tones and do n't linger - - let alone line up and make a lot of noise ( the only exception being the music corps responsible for handling the daily flag raising and lowering ceremonies ) .  
Choose any public structure in the Po Ai Special District ( the high-security area which includes the offices of top government officials ) and you may be surprised to discover that this structure has , at one and the same time , pillars and gables in the traditional Italian style , an exaggerated French Mansard style roof , and red brick walls made with decorative white stripes typical of Britain 's Victorian era .  
In the history of Chinese cities , fire-fighting measures were most thorough during the Song dynasty . Song cities resembled those of today 's Taiwan , with residences and places of business mixed together , streets less than fifty paces wide with alleys branching off them , buildings that rubbed up against each other , and great diversity within the population . With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
But in previous years when public health insurance was principally administered under labor insurance , limitations in terms of equipment , manpower , and even information about the total number of monthly registered cases in all the clinics and hospitals , made it completely unattainable . Computerized statistical analysis and cross-referencing of the vast amounts of information was even farther outside the realm of possibility .  
At the beginning of December 1992 , they organized the first public hearing over the Meinung reservoir . At the same time , in order to build consensus among local citizens , they took to driving a rickety old farm vehicle without a license plate , with signs on the front and rear painted by artist Tseng Wen-chung which said in large letters , " For farm use " and " Seventh Section Work Station . "  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
Nevertheless , according to Chang Le-chi 's description , NGOs always want to keep their image of " being afraid of becoming politically sullied . " They stand somewhat aloof from authorities . They even purposefully maintain a safe distance from political figures with similar ideas , and they forbid currently unployed essential staff from running for public office , to prevent opportunists from turning social activism into a springboard for amassing personal political resources . "  
NGOs to date have no effective channels to participate in the countless detailed activities of public administration that are underway on a daily basis . Nevertheless , NGO personnel may indeed be recruited by specialized consultative committees to help formulate policy for major issues .  
The government 's broad assimilation of non-governmental personnel theoretically should be a happy turn of events . But because the foundation of mutual trust on both sides is indeed quite fragile , those who are brought into the public sector are inevitably interpreted by their former colleagues as " lukewarm and easily lured to the other side . " Those still waving the banner and cheering for the non-governmental camp are often labeled by governmental officials as " talking tough in order to get what they want . "  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
" Moon Children " was originally selected as material for a show to be aired over public television . But this " magnum opus " of more than 70 episodes laboriously filmed over two years was held up by administrative procedures at public television , which wanted to air it reduced to 44 minutes , in two segments .  
The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life . " At the same time , because schools offered no classes in appreciation of modern poetry , the general public still needed some guidance before it could really accept this work .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
Therefore , over the last ten years , the three Peking opera troupes went on fewer and fewer military entertainment missions . The main mission of the troupes became entertaining at veteran 's homes , participating in the annual national drama competition and performing for the public .  
Commerce , like sports , is about competition . Still , it was completely unexpected that one of the losers in the public tender , ERA , would get together with the Sampo Giants ( an " amateur " team that has long sought in vain to be allowed to join the CPBL ) to organize their own professional baseball grouping . Called " Taiwan Major League Professional Baseball " ( the TML ) , it looks like it will be the second pro circuit .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
Later on , the Puli Township public works bureau took the initiative to recruit scholars and relevant administrative agencies , holding the Puli High School Tamalin Ruins Investigative Conference , at which they decided a full-scale excavation ought to take place at the original test dig site . Up through the middle of April , the archaeological dig kept going .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
In early December of last year , the Public Television Broadcasting Law was first placed on the Legislative Yuan 's agenda , and the legislators started discussing its every provision . Those legislators who support the law say that the TV programs we currently have are hardly up to snuff . The ones to be blamed for Taiwan 's questionable quality of culture are commercial TV stations . In order not to let Taiwan 's programming be devoured by alien pop culture , we need a public television station to produce high-quality shows .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
A large quantity of related products have one after the other become hot items in the marketplace . More than a few products which have nothing to do with the subject have been decorated with irrelevant " EQs . " Experts and famous public figures have been frequently invited to discuss the merits of EQ on TV and radio , and to speak at meetings and activities , exhibiting " feats of EQ . " As a matter of course , the " EQ fad " has swept into the realm of children 's education .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
In Lung 's view , the importance the Hong Kong Government attached to public buildings at that time was indicative of Hong Kong 's rapid advance in the 20th century " It was no longer a barren place which cost more than it earned , as it had been seen by Queen Victoria , and still less the insignificant speck of land it had been in the mind of the Empress Dowager Cixi , " he writes .  
Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
But the EEA has turned these disputes into public matters , and now a firm catching a competitor taking its trade secrets can file a complaint with the FBI , which can use the federal government 's resources to pursue the investigation . The FBI can also legally set up " stings " to raise the conviction rate in trade secret cases . It is tantamount to encouraging American firms to strike out foreign rivals that are threatening them .  
The unlicensed " underground radio stations " stirred up criticism about public affairs , providing a release for dissatisfaction about society and government . As new radio stations have appeared , they have gone to sensational lengths to attract listeners . On the air , young show hosts talk about sexual topics : incest , gigolos , oral sex .  
Furthermore , public electricity service in Nicaragua was unreliable , and brown-outs were common . The electric generator which the hotel used had insufficient wattage , so embarrassing episodes of guests with heads full of soap suds wrapped in bath robes screaming complaints were all too common .  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Legislators or members of the public raised questions touching on issues of education , ideology , national security , and so on . Actually , concern should mainly be focused on the substantial provisions for implementation . The Executive Yuan has assigned the MAC and the MOE to study possible relevant follow-up rules and methods . The principle of recognizing mainland degrees has not changed , and the position of the MAC on this question has never changed .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Lee suggests that Lin will promote educational reform in a steady , careful manner . Although Lin Ching-jiang is under the heat of intense public scrutiny , he displays considerable self-confidence . He has declared that educational reform is not about swashbuckling heroism , but about long-term commitment . He intends to implement smaller class sizes by the year 2006 , and emphasizes that the Ministry of Education will place high priority on adult education .  
The ROC government had been established on Taiwan for 20 years and the fruits of land reform had provided a basis for the greater prosperity of the common people . Economic activity , primarily from public investment , was flourishing . However , the island was still under martial law , political prohibitions such as those outlawing the establishment of political parties had not yet been repealed , and the social atmosphere was tense .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
The brutal murder of an ordinary postgraduate student at a prestigious university , in a research institute building with access restricted by the use of a magnetic card reader , shocked the public and aroused the special concern of the police .  
A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
The former is a passive network . It is activated when a doctor anywhere in Taiwan comes across any disease which , according to law , must be reported ; the doctor then files a report with the local bureau of public health . The latter network involves cooperation among public health agencies and about 800 doctors nationwide . Each week a telephone survey is done of the situation in various areas , so that there is constant active monitoring of overall public health conditions .  
In the recent enterovirus case , public health scholars were certain that the main channel of transmission of the disease was through fecal and oral transmission . It was rarely transmitted through the air . Thus they instructed people to avoid public places , and to thoroughly wash their hands . Also , swimming pools , kindergartens , nursery schools , and other likely locations for the spread of illness were closed .  
Its factory districts are neat and clean ; the factories themselves are sealed and lack both smokestacks belching black smoke and the never-ending streams of trucks typical of traditional industry . " [ The public ] knows nothing about the firms and has no dealings with them , " says Chung Shu-chi , a Hsinchu native who is both a delegate to the National Assembly and one of the founders of the Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Association .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
Moreover , it takes system safety very seriously and will build in passwords to prevent theft of the data . The National Card project is ready to fly , but despite repeated assurances from the RDEC and the fact that it will only combine two functions in its initial stage , the public 's opposition remains strong . Government agencies must still give careful consideration to the functions that the card will later include and the potential problems that may result .  
A few years ago , male writer Ku Ling , speaking at a public forum , advised married Taiwanese men to beware of " public menaces . " He was referring to well-educated , independent , and ambitious women who were unwilling to settle down .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Consequently , private museums established after this law came into effect have been treated precisely the same as large public museums in terms of facilities and organizational requirements : minimum structural support capacities , obstruction-free spaces , or such public safety issues as fire safety are all scrutinized against the standards governing large museums .  
" In Taiwan , AIDS is a venereal disease , " says Troy Lee . In the past , LOFAA 's primary mission was caring for AIDS victims . However , the group gradually realized that the key to AIDS prevention is education of those members of the public who are not infected with the virus . " If even sex is difficult to talk about , how can we talk about AIDS ? "  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
Hayashi Eidai says , of the Volunteers : " Do n't be distracted by their seemingly pro-Japanese public appearance , sometimes dressed in Japanese uniforms , with Japanese caps , and singing Japanese army songs . As soon as they had a drink it was not at all unknown for them to start cursing the Japanese for being heartless and immoral , and damning Japanese imperialism . " Clearly , the Volunteers carry heavy psychological baggage from the war .  
Taiwan is blessed with a number of lavishly gifted film-makers who are committed to their ideals , but the solemnity of whose creations perhaps deters a movie-going public raised on Hollywood and Disney . Their films , however , help serious cinema-goers in Taiwan and around the world to better confront life , and at the same time win international exposure for Taiwan , enabling the island 's more cultured aspect to break through in the face of international political taboos and wrangling .  
Whether for reasons of courtesy or safety , the idea that there are times when a mobile phone should be turned off is not very widespread in Taiwan . Given the difficulty of forcing people to turn off their phones , the MOTC will soon begin accepting applications from the private sector to install mobile-phone signal disrupters . This will stop the phones from functioning in areas where their use is restricted , thus resolving the problem of their use in public venues . Other controversies still exist .  
And when Taichung police cracked down on illegal drinking establishments , one station focused entirely on the response of the bars ' " public relations girls , " running a six-minute report in which the camera spent most of its time aimed at the girls ' thighs and skimpy tops .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
Amidst the hasty passage of the amendments , a provision allowing private gambling , long supported by a certain group of legislators , was attached to and passed along with the regulations . This rider reads : " For the purposes of staging internationally recognized events , application may be made to the competent authority for approval of special issuance of public welfare lottery tickets . "  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
And while she did grapple with the idea prior to going ahead with the shooting , the spread 's publication elicited a nearly universally positive response , enabling Yu Ke-hsin to cast off the public image as " megastar Andy Lau 's former girlfriend " that had dogged her for so long .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
The Executive Yuan news website , established by the Government Information Office ( GIO ) , was formally launched in August . This new website , designed as a part of the drive for " electronic , Internet-wired government , " is the Executive Yuan 's own dedicated news operation , providing audio-visual real-time news , along with information on policies and measures of the Executive Yuan . The site also takes advantage of the Net 's rapid interactive capability to give the public a direct channel of communication with the Executive Yuan .  
Lin Yi-shih has gone from scouring temple courtyards and other public gathering places for worthy competitors to participating in international competitions . Steven Chen , once playing out endgames from a night market hawker 's stand , now provides an Internet site where the best players can meet . The lives of these two chess masters have certainly changed dramatically . But that is only appropriate , since Chinese chess has itself had quite a varied and colorful life history .  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
The Philippine negation of the sovereignty of the Republic of China on Taiwan offended the ROC 's national honor and caused a public outcry here . In the following two months , the Philippines unilaterally cut Taiwan 's weekly passenger quota to 3,000 and sent notice that it would terminate the aviation accord as of October 1 . With dialogue breaking down , Taiwan finally announced the suspension of air links on October 1 . It stated that negotiations for a new aviation agreement could only begin after the old accord had been recognized and respected .  
On the flip side of the coin , the extensive and rapid development of golf courses has brought with it a sizable environmental impact , and reports of destruction of fragile hilly land areas , water consumption , pesticide use , and occupation of state land stream through the media in a constant flow . Exposure of such issues finally came to a head in the late 1980s , when environmentalists began the " movement against golf course development , " which elicited general sympathy among the public .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
And he appointed Tang Fei , a member of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and a four-star general , to become premier . As a result , Chen 's standing with the public has shot upward . A Gallup poll showed that 81% of respondents were satisfied with Chen 's performance thus far , and had great hope for the future .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
In December 1978 the US government officially announced its intention to sever relations with the ROC on January 1 1979 , and the KMT canceled the election . The public 's fear , anger , and longing for democracy fueled intense discontent . On December 10 , 1979 , Formosa magazine marked International Human Rights Day by organizing a big protest march in Kaohsiung , and the event unraveled into the infamous Kaohsiung Incident . Lu was one of the key speakers at the protest , calling on the people to fight for their rights .  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top-notch talents amid the fierce international competition .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
And now the tragedy at Pachang Creek , when millions of viewers saw four people swept to their deaths on live TV . Once again , the public is left feeling hurt and angry . And the question is raised : Are incompetence and inefficiency endemic within the structure of our bureaucracy ?  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
" In the township of Puli , for example , every single public structure collapsed , including the town hall , the police station , and the schools . That 's hard to believe . Public structures house the very agencies that are supposed to work for our safety . They should be the last buildings to fall , not the first , " says Wang , who adds that the government was only worried about tearing down and clearing away destroyed buildings after the quake , very possibly destroying evidence of fraudulent construction practices in the process .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
Pearl Tan , public relations manager at Applied Materials Taiwan , a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : DRAM , the hottest industry in Taiwan , which was a monopoly of the US firm Texas Instruments . Tan notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in the US , patent royalties must still be paid to Texas Instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced around the world annually .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Niu Gur began drawing " Uncle Niu the Guerilla Fighter " in 1951 . Finding humor amidst the tragic longing for home of the many mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 and could not go back , the strip struck a deep chord with the public , and sparked a tremendous response . Subscriptions to the Central Daily News shot upward from a few thousand per month to tens of thousands , and Uncle Niu became a major figure in cultural circles .  
Last year during the transition of power to a new administration , Lai 's financial expertise and ability to coordinate across issue areas did not go unnoticed . After taking the post of vice premier , he immediately proposed a number of policies of fundamental importance , including putting the financial system in order , helping traditional industries , upgrading infrastructure , promoting job creation , and inviting public participation . These outline the hopes of the new government for economic and financial development .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Little League baseball remains an inte-gral link in the memories all Taiwanese have of growing up . Professional baseball was also immensely popular for a time . However , in recent years , following regrettable incidents involving gambling and manipulation of players by local organized crime syndicates , baseball withered in the public 's fancy .  
His most fervent hope is that political leaders and the 600,000-strong army of public servants will " jointly build a culture of public service encompassing the nation 's legal system , institutions , and education system , in which public servants are conscientious , impartial , incorruptible and insightful , the talented are given their due , and those in the lower ranks have reason to be satisfied with their jobs . "  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
Since 1991 more than 100 new public and private high schools ( including comprehensive high schools ) have been founded , so now there are more than 270 such institutions . Meanwhile , the ratio of students entering academic vs . vocational tracks has been adjusted to 45:55 . This means that today more than 40% of kids can keep their university dream alive after junior high school .  
The devastating earthquake two years ago-the biggest in 100 years-caused 70 of the village 's 156 residences to collapse , not to mention the 30-plus houses that were left partially crippled by the disaster . While fortunately only one individual received minor injuries , none of the public buildings , including Tannan Elementary , the police station , and the village 's Catholic church , were left unscathed-in fact , most were totally destroyed . Moreover , access to the outside world was completely severed for a week .  
" For a decade or two now , researchers in other countries have been taking notice of the boost that global warming can give to disease vectors , " says Professor Wang Chiu-sen of the graduate institute of public health at National Taiwan University . The list of diseases that may be helped to spread by climate warming includes viral diseases like dengue fever , yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , bacterial diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and parasitic diseases like filariasis and schistosomiasis .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
Cheng 's songs became popular in spite of not having been commercially distributed , demonstrating the resiliency that Taiwanese music has gained by being rooted in the hearts of the people . Although the major record labels are facing tough times and releasing fewer albums , many artists are still getting their work to the public through independent labels .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
Examination Yuan vice president nominee Chang stated that if endorsed she would assist in civil service system reform by advocating professional and effective management of government agencies . In the future , public officials would need to be certified , and those that failed to meet the new criteria would be phased out .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
The magazine 's reporting was based on the underlying premise that " sex is scandalous , " and the Hsu sisters ' agent put on a vigorous " damage control " campaign and assured the public that the sisters never took Ecstasy or had sex . The two sides engaged in a furious round of accusations and denials , but one thing they did agree on was that sex is a dirty word . It was all oddly out of character for a couple of girls whose stock-in-trade was their image of being rebellious and outlandish .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
The public has been largely supportive of the new policy , but it has been noted that there are also big problems with the paper products now being used as an alternative by many retail establishments . To cut costs , 90% of all makers of paper food containers in Taiwan print on the products with substandard ink . To spruce up their products and make them more resistant to wear and tear , many buyers ask paper-goods makers to coat their products with a thin plastic film , which makes the product unrecyclable .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
In consideration of this , on March 3rd the Executive Yuan convened an inter-departmental meeting on " Promoting and Maintaining Tourism and Traveler Safety . " The purpose was to require all publicly operated scenic recreational areas to implement comprehensive inspections and to upgrade safety standards to international levels . This would include reinforcing inspection systems , adopting inspection certificates , establishing inspection teams to conduct periodic random inspections , and strengthening public accident insurance , all to prevent future tragedies from occurring .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
The public was encouraged during the Ming dynasty to practice martial arts , and people were intensely competitive about it . Ming dynasty metal workers were the first in the world to use coke and piston bellows in swordmaking , and they developed a number of advanced steelmaking techniques that led to the production of outstanding sabers and swords .  
Wang Dan 's identity gives his creative writing a free pass to the public , and even more to the mainstream media . But at the same time this also is a problem for him . It makes it unnecessary for him to pursue perfection in his literary life , and his obscure and emotional essay style readily reveals a literary technique that is not yet mature , and indeed a character that is equally childlike .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
In response to these claims , on July 10 the e-paper of President Chen Shui-bian stated that Taiwan has always had a low-tuition policy , with the best schools often being the least expensive . To help narrow the gap between tuition at heavily subsidized public universities as opposed to tuition-dependent private ones , the government subsidizes up to 20% of routine expenses at private universities , which is very rarely done anywhere else in the world .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
The odd thing is that precisely because Taiwan 's public health system was so successful in the past-because the " enemy " had been defeated in every battle-people became inattentive to public health . As time went on , frontline public health personnel neglected their training and lost completely their fighting edge .  
In markets that are jointly monopolized , large financial consortiums move fast , attracting the general public in order to make a killing . Then these companies pursue various philanthropic activities to show their compassionate side , by making public displays of charitable donations to the people of Lanyu ( even if the people there have no need of their gifts ) or funding protection of sea turtles on Lanyu ( even if the extra funds actually result in more harm to the turtles ) .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Unlike Hsinchu 's experimental primary and middle schools , which are under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Yuan 's National Science Council , STSIP 's public primary and middle schools are covered by the Tainan County Bureau of Education , and are ranked at the same level as all public primaries , enjoying no special privileges .  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .  
In recent years a number of stunning , large public works of art have cropped up in Taipei . Among them are Flying in the Eastern District at the intersection of Tunhua North Road and Minsheng East Road , and Desire in Flight , a piece in the new Panchiao station depicting a bird spreading its wings , soaring , and alighting . Their bright red colors and concise , elegant lines add warmth to a bustling intersection and train station .  
" Before I was 50 , I dedicated myself to public service , but today I am living for myself , " says Yeh Chin-chuan . No longer burdened with public office , Yeh is manifestly free and unrestrained . He has fulfilled a number of dreams he has had for many years , including climbing a mountain in Kyrgyzstan , competing in the Ironman Triathlon , swimming across Sun Moon Lake , and taking part in the Taroko marathon .  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums . The possibility that during the March presidential election next year referendums will be simultaneously held on entry into the World Health Organization , the fourth nuclear power station , and the reform of the National Assembly is also drawing close attention from observers .  
In the first place , they maintain , people are driven by their own individual interests and are frequently unable to take the broad view in considering public affairs . This " me first " attitude exacerbates conflicts of interest . Secondly , to avoid referendum issues being controlled by special-interest groups , laws must be passed to regulate public announcements , provide for the balanced presentation of information and guarantee the free flow of information .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
Will the evolution of food serve as a metaphor for the whole relationship ? Recently all the major political parties in Taiwan have been at war over the issue of public referenda , amidst dark hints from the United States and overt threats from the PRC . One can not help but sigh . When we were small , " recovering the mainland " was the unquestionable mission of the nation , and " pacifism " was a betrayal of the country and an evasion of moral responsibility .  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .  
In keeping with this view , many scholars have seen the culture industry as a system by which a small number of cultural middlemen who know how to manipulate public tastes feed consumers with a standardized , mass-produced " canned culture " that is artificial and bogus , neither the product of cultural workers ' autonomous creativity , nor capable of representing consumers ' inner yearnings .  
It is expected that interactive services will change the public 's passive TV viewing habits , shifting them toward active choice and control over viewing times . They are also likely to allow audiences to pay for programming according to what they wish to watch . However , the key to success is that the content delivered must be varied and extensive .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties .

Thus , the United States made public its view that nuclear testing was important for the security of the Western alliance , which depended on the maintenance of a reliable nuclear deterrence and that , consequently , it could consider a comprehensive test-ban treaty only as a " long-term objective " whose realization must be sought in the context of radical nuclear arms reductions , expanded confidence-building measures and , particularly , improved verification capabilities .  
It was stated that the issues of security should be considered with respect to a broad range of issues regarding negotiability .  In connection with its discussion of security issues , in particular the use of cryptography , the Working Group agreed that possible future work by UNCITRAL should not affect mandatory rules of national legislation adopted for public policy reasons in certain States to restrict the use of cryptography or the export of cryptography-related techniques .  
The exceptional cases of the alleged limitations of the human rights and freedoms of individual members of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija are the exclusive consequence of the endangering of the constitutional order of the country and the breach of public peace and order through decades-long aggressive activities of the separatist movement in this autonomous province .  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
It is estimated that an amount of $ 100,000 would be required for human rights education and public information in Guatemala to educate and keep the public civic organizations and the mass media , both national and international , informed of the Mission 's activities and findings .  
In view of the evolving mandate of the United Nations in the fields of economic and social development , peace-keeping and peacemaking , human rights and humanitarian assistance , the availability of print materials for public information is an increasingly crucial aspect of the promotion of an informed understanding and effective support for the work of the United Nations .  
As part of its primary responsibility for public information activities built around the World Public Information Campaign for Human Rights and the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in 1993 , the Department reprinted and distributed essential publications on human rights , including backgrounders on human rights and culture and on indigenous people .  
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
It used the occasion to inform the public of its objectives , and of the state of the implementation of the legislation in favour of disabled persons ; to organize sports competitions , tricycle race , soccer matches for physically disabled , athletic activities for deaf , and a cycling race for blind and visually impaired persons ; to organize cultural and economic activities .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal and more equitable access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
A representative of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) emphasized that violence against women was a major public health issue , since it led to psychological trauma , depression , substance abuse , injuries , sexually transmitted diseases , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , suicide and death ; however , the victims rarely received rehabilitative care , or the compensation received by the victims of other injury-causing trauma .  
One organization asserted that this recommendation was unfortunately silent on existing mechanisms for inter-agency meetings on public information issues covering high-priority agenda items such as social and economic development , crime prevention and criminal justice , human rights , environment and sustainable development , women and development , population and refugees .  
It aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
On average , women represent a mere 10 per cent of all elected legislators world wide and in most national and international administrative structures , both public and private , they remain underrepresented .  
Encourage the future development of peace research involving the participation of women to examine the impact of armed conflict on women and children , and the nature and contribution of women 's participation in national , regional and international peace movements ; engage in research and identify innovative mechanisms for containing violence and for conflict resolution for public dissemination , for use by women and men ; ( d ) bis Develop and disseminate research on the physical , psychological ,  
The Constitution of El Salvador , amended pursuant to the peace agreements , gives the President of the Republic the power to use the armed forces for the maintenance of domestic peace , tranquillity , order and public safety " in exceptional cases , where the normal means [ for that purpose ] have been exhausted " .  
It should be noted that although this measure is , in theory , based on the Constitution , the spirit of the peace agreements requires that it be subject to legal rules which establish expressly and restrictively the requirements and conditions which must be met before domestic peace , tranquillity , order or public safety can be considered to be endangered , in exceptional cases , and before the normal means for their preservation can be considered to have been exhausted .  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
To mitigate the heavy burdens of the poor , the Social Fund for Development ( SFD ) was established in 1991 as a temporary step to enhance structural adjustment programmes as well as to contribute to social well-being and protect vulnerable and low-income groups .  SFD executes six programmes , dealing with public works , community development , enterprise development , employment and retraining , institutional development and public transport .  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
Ten ad hoc expert group meetings . ( i ) Strategic management of the State and public budgets ; ( ii ) economic reform experiences in the countries of the region ; ( iii ) capacity for government ( 2 ) ; ( iv ) decentralization and local government ( 2 ) ; ( v ) regional development bodies ; ( vi ) management of regional development ; ( vii ) alternative approaches to the social evaluation of projects ; and ( viii ) project banks and investment planning . ( a ) Advisory services . 
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
The estimated requirements of $ 19,700 , reflecting negative growth of $ 31,500 , relate to the following expenditures : ( a ) public information production : reduced requirements of $ 10,600 would cover the cost of engaging external marketing research organizations and other related contractual services with a view to ensuring that the Department 's outputs are responsive to targeted audiences and their identified needs ; and ( b ) subscription to news agency services ( $ 9,100 ) . 
It is estimated that a provision of $ 865,700 , reflecting growth of $ 41,000 , would be required for the acquisition of professional radio and television reference books and materials , and public information supplies such as film , raw stock , audio and video tapes and cassettes , photographic film , paper and chemicals and other miscellaneous materials required for radio and visual productions and supplies for the operation of the typesetting system .  
The estimated requirement of $ 393,500 , at maintenance base level , would cover the cost of general temporary assistance for the replacement of staff on maternity leave and sick leave and for additional services during peak workload periods ( $ 373,800 ) ; and overtime and night differential for the retention of clerical and distribution staff and radio and visual technicians beyond normal working hours in order to provide public information material to the media .  
The major objective of the subprogramme is to meet the needs of Member States for information and policy-oriented analysis on selected issues related to private sector development and the enhancement of the efficiency and effectiveness of public enterprises through the promotion of market-oriented approaches , including the interactions between the international economic environment and national policy actions .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .  
UNDP assistance for the development of national capacity includes the reform of policies at the macro level thereby ensuring retention of qualified personnel , including fiscal polices , public administration law , civil service reform , including downsizing and the creation of professional incentives and more rational differentiation between salary scales .  
In the Seychelles , the national human resource development programme has as its objective increasing labour productivity through the creation of an enabling environment and incentives to the private sector and through reforms leading to greater capacity and increased efficiency in the public sector .  
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
Viewing the public service as a critical agent of change , the Programme aims to rebuild a public service that is the servant of the people : accessible , accountable , efficient , free of corruption , and providing excellent quality .  
The public service is defined as an institution that should be professional ; career-oriented ; non-partisan ; efficient , effective and responsive in terms of service delivery ; loyal in its service to the public and the elected Government of the day ; accountable to the public and Parliament .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
In many developing countries there is an apparent lack of a " critical mass " of qualified managers , technicians , and skilled workers needed to support basic levels of public sector activity .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
Clearly , desirable levels of effective coordination do not result from the mere creation of joint departments : rather , they should arise from the regular , institutionalized work of combined units set up to monitor public socio-economic policies .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
Secondly , the Indian Administrative Service ( IAS ) has established a professional corps of educated public administrators who share a common background of professional training , accept a common set of responsibilities towards developing the capacities of the citizenry in their jurisdictions , and represent a strong presence of the national Government in state and local jurisdictions .  
The explanatory memorandum annexed to document A / 50 / 145 presumptuously claims that the examination by the United Nations of Taiwan 's " exceptional situation in the international context " " completely conforms with the principles and spirit of preventive diplomacy " .  This is an apparent attempt to confound black and white and mislead the public .  
This principle , first expressed in German law and in international law , is accepted as a general principle in all legal systems regarding public administration , but it is usually reflected in specific principles of more or less limited scope ;  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
According to Professor Ben Achour , French public law is a weapon for new nation-States in formation with its basic concepts of an autonomous administrative law reflecting the superiority of public interest and public service , whereas its liberal face inspired reformist and nationalist movements demanding the enforcement of revolutionary and republican principles .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
Nevertheless the path explored by the reformist Arab writers of the nineteenth century should be pursued and legal principles elaborated capable of bridging the gap between various communities and modern public administration , a step which is needed for participation in the world economy .  
As a result , the same activity can be performed in different countries by a public corporation or by the private sector ; it can be considered as a public utility or public service subject to extensive public regulation or , on the contrary , left to pure market economy , only subject ( for example ) to the law of competition and public order .  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
It has actively involved local , regional and national education authorities , teachers , parents , students , potential employers , non-governmental organizations and regional public and private institutions / organizations that can assist in the designing and testing of the new curriculum .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
By democratization , I mean a process by which an authoritarian society becomes increasingly participatory through such mechanisms as periodic elections to representative bodies , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
Because corrupt activities on the part of public officials can destroy the potential effectiveness of governmental programmes , hinder development and victimize individuals and groups , it is important that adequate criminal laws , including procedural legislation , be adopted to allow a recourse to sanctions and ensure an effective deterrence .  
In the initial period of 1994 , a conceptual approach was agreed upon , namely that the declaration should address the general public , utilize simple and not grandiose language , be substantive in nature , strive for brevity and reflect a thematic approach .  
The Preparatory Committee was advised that the Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its 1994 spring session held at Geneva , had further considered these issues , including , increasing system-wide participation in the fiftieth anniversary and consolidating the messages that the Organization would direct towards the general public during the critical year 1995 .  
The regulatory activities of the judges during the first half of 1994 , which for journalists were overly technical and which held little meaning among the general public , together with the preparatory work of the Deputy Prosecutor , which appeared dry work , were not initially helpful to the Tribunal when it came to overcoming the scepticism expressed throughout the first months of its existence .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .  
National measures for the Year have been successful in raising public awareness of family issues , including increased knowledge of the economic , social , demographic , cultural and other factors affecting families and their members .  
These included two introductory posters , published in 1990 and 1991 , and a major campaign poster in the six official languages , published in 1992 ; a press kit , three public television announcements and two documentary films on single-parent families and on the family and ageing , produced by the Department of Public Information ; a regularly updated calendar of events related to the Year ; stickers on the Year and the International Day of Families .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .  
The main topics of discussion will be determining which priority projects still needed to be executed and the means required for refocusing public interest and donor attention on Chernobyl , with special attention paid to ways of marking the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl on 26 April 1996 . 
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
Other steps included close cooperation to ensure that all the group 's financial sector operations were carried out in the context of a sound reform strategy ; explicit support by the group to privatization , through the provision of advisory services to Governments and the provision of finance for public enterprise restructuring and investments in privatized firms ; and the intensification of the group 's research on private sector issues .  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
In general , the United Nations system should be able to help Governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experiences and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
Implementation is primarily the responsibility of Governments , but is also dependent on a wide range of institutions in the public , private and non-governmental sectors at the community , national , subregional / regional and international levels . specifically devoted to women 's advancement globally . 
Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .  
On average , women represent a mere 10 per cent of all elected legislators world wide and in most national and international administrative structures , both public and private , they remain underrepresented .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
Promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services ;  
The accumulation of theoretical knowledge has irreplaceable value for the purposes of educating younger generations and the public in general and for devising strategies and developing measures to counter the corrupting effects of organized crime on societal values .  
The decisive condition for their realization is the spontaneous initiative of individuals , first of all representatives of cultural and public life and of youth , with the financial assistance of national and international organizations and foundations .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
The most pressing task faced by the Department of Public Information is to ensure that the centrality of the United Nations in meeting the compelling challenges faced by the international community continues to be widely recognized by Governments and the world public at large , including in particular the influential non-official actors emerging on the world stage .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .

Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
The public was showing increasing concern regarding illicit trafficking ; it was noted that the press file prepared for the eighth session had doubled in size over the previous session , indicating that there had been a very great increase in public interest .  
NULLThe Programme of Work had divided the remaining accords into six areas ( public security , land transfer , human settlements , reintegration programmes , Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and Disabled and legislative reforms ) and established dates by which specific provisions in each area must be completed .  
NULLThe programme of work had divided the remaining accords into six areas ( public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and Disabled , and legislative reforms ) and established dates by which specific provisions in each area must be completed .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
In recognition of the vital role of national meteorological services in providing warnings of severe weather events to the community , WMO 's Public Weather Services Programme includes specific projects directed at strengthening the capacities of national meteorological services and in raising the awareness and level of public understanding about the services provided .  
Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
The study enjoys the guidance and advice of a group of eminent persons made up of individuals of international repute and integrity drawn from every geographic region and representing a wide diversity of political , religious and cultural backgrounds ; this group also acts as a public advocate .

This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
The alleged perpetrators include clandestine organizations which , while claiming to be fighting against crime and impunity , have been responsible for threats of this kind , have thwarted investigations of crimes against human rights , caused the resignation of public prosecutors in high-profile cases and intimidated relatives and prospective new victims . 
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
The Programme of Action calls on Governments to increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially , inter alia , by formulating or strengthening , preferably by 1996 , and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels . 
Promotion of effective enjoyment by all people of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and access to existing social protection and public services , in particular through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of relevant human rights instruments ;  
NULLAs emphasized in previous reports , one of the circumstances leading to abuses against women is the practically unlimited powers granted to members of the Popular Police Forces and the People 's Committees " in the preservation of the moral health of the society " .  Article 5 , chapter I of Constitutional Decree No .  1993 concerning private and public life states as follows :  
It also continued to collaborate actively with regional organizations in Africa , and to provide extensive technical assistance for the effective management of policy reforms in many areas , including public finance , monetary policy , debt management and exchange rate management , as well as in the design of social safety nets .  
The north fa \ x { 84f7 } de is 160 ft ( 48.77 m ) in width and set with marble-faced ribbon piers alternating with specially designed translucent glass panels which illuminate the public lobby with a subdued light .  
Initiatives of the Group have included : the cost-sharing venture to finance a multi-sectoral AIDS study tour for concerned Cambodian government officials in Thailand ; encouragement to the Ministry of Information to take a more active and creative approach in its efforts to inform the Cambodian public ; and improving the coordination between the different United Nations agencies involved in combating the spread of the virus .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
The Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .  
An important area of activity of the Chair shall be the progressive development of a nationwide system of permanent education for democracy and peace through human rights , including the elaboration of special educational programmes for members of such services as the army , the police , penitentiary personnel , the teaching profession , public administration , the judiciary , etc .

Federation was also dissatisfied with the part of the ICSC annual report dealing with the Geneva survey , which stated that staff representatives had threatened to make public any anomalous situations contained in the survey , thus breaching the confidentiality of the data provided by the participating employers .  
it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .

that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
delegation was fully convinced that economic development alone was not enough to prevent humanitarian crises , and that political efforts were required to promote respect for human rights , the rule of law and responsible management of public affairs .  
Robaina Gonz \ x { 5aee } ez ( Cuba ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Government of Cuba has requested the resumption of this session of the General Assembly in order to provide information regarding the events surrounding the repeated violation of our sovereignty by aircraft originating from United States territory , and also to give notice to the international community and to world public opinion that such violations are inadmissible and have dangerous implications for regional peace and security .  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
A stable legal framework , fair and efficient law enforcement and equal access to public services and justice , in accordance with international standards of human rights , are essential conditions for the creation of transparent and accountable institutions , for the promotion of a public administration that is responsive to the needs of the population and for the prevention of and fight against all forms of corruption .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
We are eager for greater efficiency and competitiveness in the public sector , for ongoing improvement in the provision of services , for excellence in public services , for the application of the most modern managerial techniques , for social marketing and for ethics in public service , which requires respect for such specific values as institutional loyalty and transparency of procedures .  
Regarding public finance , we strengthened the financial institutions for State financial programming and introduced new budgetary norms to secure investments in projects that are duly formulated and coordinated by our central planning body .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
The work of public administration should be guided by the principle that correct decisions should be taken , without unnecessary delay , and at the lowest possible administrative level as close as possible to the people whom the decisions will affect and that powers and accountability should go hand in hand .  
In this context , the major tool utilized by public administration in its work should not be decisions taken on an individual basis , but regulations intended to create mechanisms and frameworks within which independent activity can take place and social and economic entities can produce initiatives .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
In this context , the State seeks to modernize the kinds of measures taken by its public administration by gradually shifting its management and production actions towards a stronger public administration role in overseeing regulation and the proper functioning of economic mechanisms , in guaranteeing political and social stability and in protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society , in a spirit of social justice and rational solidarity .  
The imperatives of reducing budget deficits and the desire to achieve operational efficiency shared by us all could not possibly be the basis for a universal conclusion favouring the diminishment of the State or the systematic dismantling of public administration at the cost of inviting the disruption of networks that provide structure and sustenance to economic and social life in many developing countries .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
On the other hand , the Government was faced with crippling obstacles , in the form of a treasury that had been emptied and swept clean by the ousted regime ; the threat from regrouped elements of the defeated army of the former regime ; a completely decimated public service ; and interference by hostile foreign Governments associated with the defeated former regime .  
Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
These included the rethinking of existing organizational structures and the introduction of role delineation ; the revision of existing legislation and the introduction of new legislation to reflect subsidiarity ; the introduction of an information technology infrastructure ; sustained development initiatives in management of change and business re-engineering ; the setting up of local Government to enhance citizen empowerment ; the revamping of human resources practices and procedures ; the new salary structure , which reduced 96 pay scales to 20 ; and the introduction of a code of ethics for all public officers .  
In contrast with Europe , the absence of a middle class able to launch the process of economic and social development , the weakness of the industrial fabric , the well-known inadequacy of public facilities and national structure were , at the time of independence , major challenges to be met .  Hence the need for State intervention , including through protectionism , to modify the nature of comparative advantages .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
The reform altered 65 of the Constitution 's 202 articles , with respect to individual rights ; the rights and responsibilities of and guarantees for the Nicaraguan people ; political and social rights ; the rights of the Nicaraguan family ; defence and the national economy ; agrarian reform and public finances ; education and culture ; the organization of the State ; municipal affairs ; and the Atlantic Coast communities . 
Thus , seven preparatory studies have been undertaken in fields as diverse and important as the following : first , remuneration in the civil service ; second ; summary of audits conducted in certain Ministries ; third , rapid diagnostic assessments of Ministries that have not been audited ; fourth , administrative practices and the State of law ; fifth , analysis of the general status of the civil service ; sixth , inquiry into the image of the public sector ; and , seventh , ethics , professional conduct and motivation of State employees .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .  
There may be merit in some of these assertions , but this is only correct when the public sector is not well trained ; when its size can not be justified on the output and quality of services offered ; or when the policies it delivers run counter to the accumulation of national wealth , efficient delivery of social services or administration of justice .  
They are also aimed at creating a lean , efficient , highly motivated and dutiful civil service , based on the job requirements and carefully evaluated professional requirements of each Ministry and public institution .  
The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The surge in media and public interest during the fiftieth anniversary resulted in the Department 's tripling its production of backgrounders , fact-sheets , notes for speakers and special radio and television programmes , all of which were transmitted through pouch and electronic means to specific audiences worldwide .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
It firmly declares the will of all political forces in Bulgaria Mr . Lukanov having been an active member of Parliament for the last seven years not to permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the path towards economic and political reform or to infringe on the peaceful and lawful process of political and public life , including the forthcoming presidential elections at the end of this month .  
That is why in many African countries today Governments continue with determination to carry out bold and difficult reforms , reflected , inter alia , in the improved and more rational use of public funds , in the opening of our economies to international trade and in the creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise and to the transparent management of public affairs with , most importantly , all sectors of society participating in the work of national development , in the interests of all .  
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
Further , it had established a family planning and education policy which allowed it , through mother and child public health services , to keep the population informed regarding every kind of health and nutritional problem , and it applied strict primary and community health care policies in villages and rural centres .  
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
FATTAH ( Egypt ) said that , in view of the major responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in recent years and the increased attention it was giving to social and economic matters , the Organization had a proportionately greater need to secure the support of world public opinion through the invaluable role currently played by the information media .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
Ratification of the Convention had also had a positive educational impact on the public , had satisfied a long-standing demand by women 's organizations and had stimulated legislative , administrative and other measures on the part of individual ministries .  
Non-governmental organizations , particularly those in the north , were doing a remarkable job in the fields of advocacy and protection , and , thanks to the joint action of the international community , States and non-governmental organizations , international public opinion was becoming favourable to the idea of controlling and combating all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief .  
The Constitution contained provisions entitling women to remedial and affirmative action , with a view to enabling them to participate in political , economic and social life and gain access to positions in public and private institutions on an equal footing with men .  
To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
With regard to the human rights of women , particularly the right to equal status , which was dealt with in the Beijing Platform for Action , he stressed that the first woman prime minister in the world had been elected in Sri Lanka and that the election of Mrs . Kumaratunga to the office of President by an overwhelming popular vote indicated that Sri Lankans accepted the role of women in political and social life and their holding the highest public offices .  
Increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially by , inter alia , formulating or strengthening and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ;  
A strengthened Centre could not only mobilize public awareness but also provide vital assistance to Governments and non-governmental organizations in the field of advisory services and training with a view to facilitating implementation and understanding of human rights instruments at the national level .  
In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
SHAH ( India ) said that India , a pluralistic nation with well-established humanistic traditions of tolerance , harmony and non-violence , guaranteed fundamental human rights to all its citizens ; those rights were enforced by an independent judiciary and jealously guarded by a free and vigilant press , an articulate public opinion and a vast network of non-governmental organizations .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
However , the progress made towards establishing the institutional and physical infrastructure for the active involvement of the public and private sector in the economy , though notable , fell short of expectations , which appeared to have been overly optimistic .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The liaison offices will maintain contacts with their respective host Governments on issues relevant to the missions ; relay relevant information ( including media reports ) to United Nations Headquarters and to the three missions ; undertake liaison tasks on behalf of the missions ; provide assessments and advice to other United Nations agencies operating in the region ; and provide timely and accurate public information on United Nations activities to local and international media .  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;

Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
The report , which shall be a classified State and regional document , shall be drawn up in accordance with the format and contents determined by the Security Commission and shall include all naval , air , land and public security data needed for the information provided to be complete , transparent and verifiable , solely and exclusively by the organs of the model established in article 47 of this Treaty or by those designated by them ;  
To provide information , within the Security Commission , on the respective military and public security expenditures approved in their budgets for the current fiscal year , taking as a reference the " Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures " adopted by the United Nations on 12 December 1990 , under the provisions of article 52 ( k ) of this Treaty ; and ,  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
The quality of life of the people depends , among other economic , social , environmental and cultural factors on the physical conditions and spatial characteristics of our villages , towns and cities .  City lay-out and aesthetics , land-use patterns , population and building densities , transportation and ease of access for all to basic goods , services and public amenities have crucial bearing on the livability of settlements .  
Objectives of this endeavour include protecting public health , providing for safety and security conditions , education , and social integration , promoting equality , respect for diversity and cultural identities , increased accessibility for persons with disabilities , and preservation of historic , spiritual , religious and culturally significant buildings and districts , respecting local landscapes and treating the local environment with respect and care .  
This requires , as appropriate , establishing policies , laws and regulations for both public and private activities , encouraging responsible private activities in all fields , facilitating community groups ' participation , adopting transparent procedures , encouraging public-spirited leadership and public-private partnerships , and helping people to understand and exercise their rights and responsibilities through open and effective participatory processes , universal education and information dissemination .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
To promote social integration , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , recognizing the importance of volunteer contributions and in close cooperation with non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , the cooperative sector and public and private foundations , should :  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for human settlements development and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary and individual voluntary contributions ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
As stressed above , criteria and indicators defined at the national level are aimed at improving the quantity and quality of information available to decision makers and the general public about progress towards sustainable forest management , and thus to assist in the policy and decision-making process ; the ultimate aim in this regard is to further improve forest management practices over time .  
To avoid alarmist or misleading awareness campaigns , they need reliable and representative information - e.g . , on various forest types ( boreal , temperate , tropical , wet , dry , natural , plantations , monocultures ) ; ( e ) The general public and media . 
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals for filling any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situation of African countries ;  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
With strong support from the interim secretariat , bilateral donors and United Nations agencies , national awareness seminars are widespread and are doing a good job of educating key national actors , in both the public and private sectors , about the significance of the Convention .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peace-keeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peace-keeping operations are conducted .  
Considering that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
Acting on the recommendation of the Tangier Declaration , the General Assembly adopted resolution 49 / 136 on public administration and development , in which it recognized the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , and also recognized the need for strengthened public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the people .  
The specific topics under the theme " Capacity-building in public administration " were the enhancement of policy development capacity , organizational strengthening , improved civil service systems , the strengthening of financial management for development , human resource development for the public sector , and the development of administrative capacities for post-conflict and crisis conditions .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
From 1980 emphasis has been placed on the role of the public sector in promoting the economic development of developing countries , with auxiliary activities concentrating on the role of qualified national personnel in the social and economic development of developing countries , and specialized topics such as the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade , the development of human resources , or United Nations programmes of action for African economic recovery and development .  
In the area of public administration , programme activities focus on strengthening administrative and organizational systems at both the central and local levels , improving management methods and practices through modern management techniques and information technology , and legal frameworks and programmes that are sensitive to the global economy .  
For the past 45 years , pursuant to its various legislative mandates , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .  
Current assessment of most developing and transitional economies demonstrates that national Governments may need international support and cooperation in improving their public administration systems and training their personnel for initiating and implementing dynamic social programmes .  
Each conference made major recommendations , which will have an impact on the ways in which national Governments will function , and point to the need for an effective and efficient public administration system in planning and implementing those recommendations and for the support and cooperation of relevant United Nations and other international and regional institutions in assisting Governments to improve their public administration systems .  
Public administration will continue to fulfil critical functions in development , supporting measures for economic growth , protecting the environment , determining the relationship between the public and the private sector , reducing poverty and illiteracy and other social development activities , thereby achieving the goals of sustainable development .  
To fulfil critical future-shaping functions , public administration needs to establish a dynamic people-oriented system through strategic restructuring for transparency and participation , as well as outstanding professionalism by attracting bright , energetic , visionary people into public administration .  
That process is time-consuming , expensive and delicate , but such a deliberative process is the only hope for genuine development , which in turn depends upon talented , skilled and sensitive public administrators for implementation . 
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
To strengthen effective collaboration and coordination among various programmes in governance and public management currently carried out by various United Nations agencies , including Bretton-Woods institutions such as the World Bank and IMF , it is recommended that the consultative group include representation from all relevant United Nations agencies , regional commissions and the World Bank . The group will also be open to other interregional and regional governmental organizations and appropriate international or regional professional and research institutions .  
Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .  
The immediate strategy would include the assessment of national absorptive capacities , human and capital ; the definition of policy issues and drafting of national policies ; the restructuring and operation of key ministries for implementation of the defined policies ; the restoration of management systems and tools ( e.g . , personnel , audit , information ) ; the restoration and management of justice and public safety systems ; the retention and enlistment of professional human resources ; and the provision of crash training and retraining programmes .  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
Professional staff in the Office of the Spokesperson should be assigned departments concerned with major news stories and should attend relevant departmental staff meetings , and receive regular briefings from senior staff in their department of assignment on the public information aspects of the work of the department and important decisions made .  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
33 In addition , the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts encompassed discussions on the development of an adequate legal basis for combatting corruption , including rules and regulations on the conduct of public office holders as well as clear statutory prohibitions , penalties , and procedures for investigating , bringing to trial and punishing persons engaged in corrupt acts .  
Article 5 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that no law enforcement official may inflict , instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war , a threat to national security , international political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
A state of war ( in 49 countries ) , a threat of war ( in 46 countries ) , a threat to national security ( in 52 countries ) , internal political instability ( in 52 countries ) and other public emergency ( in 49 countries ) is not sufficient justification for torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
Israel , however , reported that the Landau Commission for the Inquiry into the Investigation Techniques of the General Security Services ( GSS ) concluded that if a public emergency developed , or whenever an imminent threat to national security was at hand , GSS investigators would be able to use " moderate physical pressure " to gain important information from those who knowingly endangered public safety .  
In areas in which public interest is lacking , there is no requirement of effective and beneficial use , and regulations and planning are disregarded and discouraged , experience shows that the role of markets has not been as relevant as is assumed by the theoretical justification of the model ; ( f ) Such areas are already experiencing problems due to the monopolization of water rights and related public services .  
Conflicts have not been resolved by markets , and the water administration is to a large extent unable to address them ; ( g ) Water legislation should include water marketing principles , established within a balanced structure in which property protected water rights are accommodated to public interest , including the principle of effective and beneficial use and environmental protection .  
In order to maintain public finances on a sound footing while simultaneously meeting social commitments , the Government implemented tax reforms by widening the tax base ; increasing tax rates ; restructuring tax brackets to increase progressivity of personal income tax ; and by raising excise taxes to finance an increase in pensions and educational spending .  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
36 Panama reported on legislative amendments to its Penal Code , dealing , inter alia , with the criminalization and penalization of physical or psychological aggression , violence and intimidation , corruption of minors and indecent assault , incest and the commission or knowledge of an act of domestic violence by a public or private official , as well as the failure to inform the proper authorities of such an act .  
The possibility that public awareness , educational or other material designed to prevent or reduce illicit demand may draw attention to the availability and means of abuse of prohibited drugs within certain segments of the population is a difficult issue that remains to be resolved .  
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Recognizing the need for effective government and efficient public administrative services to be responsive to the needs of the people , to ensure universal access to quality services and productive assets and to create an enabling environment for sustainable development and provide quality services ,  
Reaffirming the importance of promoting cooperation among all countries in enhancing the quality of public administration , including , inter alia , the promotion of a participatory approach to development , the provision of basic social services , the development of policies to eradicate poverty and the establishment of an enabling environment for economic growth , social justice and sustainable development ,

They point out , inter alia , that justice requires that everyone be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal , in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( General Assembly resolution 217 A ( III ) ) , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( General Assembly resolution A ( XXI ) , annex ) and other United Nations instruments .  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
Along those lines , it was suggested that the requirement should be limited to sensitive areas of public service or to cases where an abuse of power might be suspected and that the last sentence should be revised to read : " All information provided shall be treated as confidential but may be disclosed at a country 's discretion within the framework of special procedures . "  
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
Within [ a ] [ the ] stated period [ of one / two years ] after separation from public service , public officials holding managerial positions shall , within the framework of national law , obtain governmental permission prior to accepting employment or consultancy assignments from business or private concerns that are in [ direct ] financial relationship with the governmental department or agency in which such officials were employed .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed the willingness of his Government to take immediate , active steps to promote crop substitution and rural development , in close cooperation with UNDCP and other States , by purchasing products such as wheat , cotton and rice from Afghan farmers at prices higher than they could obtain from illicit crops , by contributing to road construction , and by assisting in preventive education and public awareness campaigns for Afghan farmers .  
Major areas for policy , programme and project intervention will include nutrition ; the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity ; comprehensive reproductive health , including fertility regulation and sexual health , maternal health and safe motherhood , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS ; violence against women and girls as a public health issue ; female genital mutilation ; occupational health ; and increasing the use of gender-based indicators and of national legislation to promote women 's health .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
Recognizing that effectiveness of government requires an efficient and effective public administration in all countries that is responsive to the needs of the people , promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable people-centred development ,  
Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
The overall objectives of this programme are to provide a unified central legal service for the Secretariat and the principal and other organs of the United Nations , to contribute to the progressive development and codification of international public and trade law , to promote the strengthening and development as well as the effective implementation of the international legal order for the seas and oceans , to register and publish treaties , and to perform the depositary functions of the Secretary-General .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;

The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
The programme , under the responsibility of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) , focuses its analytical work on designing public policies and facilitates the implementation of such policies , concentrating operational services in the areas of specialized information , advisory assistance , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
The second objective is to facilitate the development of an analytic framework available to the region 's countries that can assist them in determining the public agenda on , among others , public safety , corruption , poverty and drug abuse , consistent with the economic and social policies required for changing production patterns with social equity .  
To promote awareness in Africa and in the international community of the nature of the critical economic and social situation in Africa , and of the domestic and international efforts required for recovery and development , through wide dissemination of the periodical African Recovery to the general public and to target groups such as parliamentarians , non-governmental organizations , trade unions and academic institutions , as well as through outreach to the African and international mass media ;  
Developments in public administration have been influenced in recent years by fundamental changes , including technological advances , global economic interdependence , aggravation of social problems and the growing importance of the private sector .

To assist Governments , at their request , in developing the necessary capabilities to enable public administration to implement the commitments agreed upon at major United Nations conferences in an effective and coordinated manner , ensuring the maintenance of essential basic government services and functions during times of crisis and developing strategies for rebuilding a viable public administration in countries undergoing post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction ;  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .  
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
It will be seen that the information contained in the Greek Cypriot representative 's aforementioned letter is deliberately wrong and is designed to mislead the world public opinion by exploiting such an unfortunate incident .  
As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .  In this connection , we must facilitate capacity-building and promote the transfer of appropriate technology and know-how .  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
The Commission also continued to study the distributive aspects of economic development , with special emphasis on analysing the effects of adjustment processes on income distribution ; public policies aimed at changing production patterns and promoting sustainable development and social equity , with an emphasis on assessing their effectiveness in those different spheres .  
In relation to natural resources and energy , it focused on addressing issues of institutional management , defining the roles of the State , particularly in regard to privatization and regulation , contributing to the design and application of public policies for integrated natural resources management and providing support for the regional implementation of international environmental agreements that relate to natural resource management .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " .

Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
The Special Fund was established by the General Assembly to provide new administrative and operational machinery to spearhead the enlargement of the scope of United Nations technical assistance and , in particular , to " . . . facilitate new capital investments of all types - private and public , national and international - by creating conditions which would make such investments either feasible for more effective " ( General Assembly resolution 1219 ( XII ) on the financing of economic development , dated 14 December 1957 ) .  
Moreover , the inaction of the institutions responsible for investigating the appearance in public places of abandoned corpses , whose common characteristics conform to the modus operandi of " social cleansing " operations , supports reasonable doubts as to the existence of the clandestine structures referred to in commitment IV of the Comprehensive Agreement .  
Adopt measures , prior to the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace , and without detriment to the legal dissolution of the voluntary civil defence committees , to eradicate and put a stop to the establishment of organizations of varying names and origins , including some of those established to replace disbanded voluntary civil defence committees , which carry out State functions , such as security or public order , outside the institutional framework of the State .  
That had made it possible to implement policies which were better adapted to local conditions in the areas of health and education , particularly in the provinces of the North and the Iles Loyaut , controlled by the FLNKS , which had succeeded in catching up to a considerable extent in the areas of infrastructure and public services , and achieving major progress in the economic sphere .  
Article 9.2 : " It is incumbent upon the public authorities to promote conditions which ensure that the freedom and equality of individuals and of the groups to which they belong are real and effective , to remove obstacles which prevent or hinder their full enjoyment , and to facilitate participation by all citizens in political , economic , cultural and social life . "  
It will be seen below that all the autonomous communities have some public body responsible for ensuring that all forms of discrimination are truly eliminated , as well as for taking whatever steps are required to bring about real equality in all areas of public , economic , cultural and social life .  
Act No . 10 / 1994 of 19 May on urgent job promotion measures , published on 23 May 1994 , continues the public funding established earlier by Act No . 22 / 1992 of 30 July on urgent measures to promote employment and provide unemployment protection , which had established a government programme to promote hiring on indefinite contracts , with 500,000 pesetas earmarked ( sixth additional provision ) for promotion of the recruitment of women in professions in which they are under-represented .  
Lastly , article 314 of the new Criminal Code imposes a penalty , in the matter of offences against the rights of workers , on persons who are guilty of serious discrimination in public or private employment against any person on the grounds of opinion , religion or belief , ethnicity , race or nationality , gender , sexual orientation , family situation , ill health , disability , avowed legal or trade union representation of workers , being related to other staff members , or use of any of the official languages of the Spanish State .

As pointed out in the previous report , Spain 's educational system is based on the principle of equal opportunity , and public education is compulsory , coeducational and free for children aged 6 to 16 .  
Arranging for dissemination to the public of information on the Authority 's activities and decisions ; ( i ) Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economical and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
Mainly because of the prevailing low rates of both public and private saving , lack of competitivity in international trade and some ill-adapted economic policies , African countries did not succeed in mobilizing the aggregated $ 82.5-billion that were to come from Member States to support the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development over the period from 1986 to 1991 .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
Cooperatively structured community enterprises are an effective organizational means whereby grass-roots initiative and both public and private funds can be combined in order to revitalize disadvantaged communities without creating dependency .  
Therefore , one can not find in the draft articles concepts such as water basin or integrated management . one can see sufficiently enshrined neither substantive principles such as sustainable development , precaution and preventive action nor their procedural corollaries : the requirement of environmental impact assessments , of transparency , of broadly informing and notifying the public and of consultation and negotiation on the impact of planned measures . 
The United States Secretary of Defense and Speaker of the House have recently intensified their campaign of disinformation and hostile propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by the reckless suggestion of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran respectively on National Public Radio on 2 August and NBC 's " Meet the Press " of 28 July - statements which represent blatant examples of political manipulation of public opinion already apprehensive about the recent tragic events . 
To the extent , however , that those signals are wrong ( in that they are not reflecting the real value of the resources involved , and the degree of scarcity that is implicit in their continued supply ) , the users will be inefficient and wasteful from a public and societal point of view .

Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .  
In the face of reassertion of ethnic - some may call it tribal - identities , of revival of neo-liberal ideas based on extreme individualism and deregulation , as well as of other centrifugal forces , it becomes imperative at the international level to insist on general , as opposed to particular , State interests and to work towards the development of a public order of the international community .

It was noted , however , that BOT and similar projects could be quite complex and that their implementation required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing .

Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .

It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
In view of the current serious situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , the Committee intends to encourage renewed , intensified efforts by non-governmental organizations to organize and coordinate sustained campaigns in order to inform public opinion and to promote national and international action in support of United Nations resolutions and the Committee 's objectives .  
Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
While disseminating information about the Court through traditional methods is to be welcomed and further encouraged , my delegation believes that the use of advanced technology in enhancing public awareness about the Court and its activities should be improved .

Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies submitted by Bulgaria be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
The Committee also recommends that a comprehensive and integrated public information campaign be elaborated with a view to preventing and combating all forms of abuse of children and that all necessary measures be taken to ensure the physical and psychological recovery and the social reintegration of children victims of the war , in the light of article 39 of the Convention .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by Ethiopia be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies presented by Panama be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
They include : a Swedish firm with a successful record of restructuring private companies , which helped in the design and start-up of the overall change process , and whose former chief executive officer continues to advise UNDP 2001 ; a Canadian expert on change management ; an American expert on public sector change ; and a leading information technology management group from the United States .  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
Public-sector ICT applications include distance learning and continuing professional development ; road traffic management ; disabled support services ; air-traffic control ; health-care networks ; electronic tendering for contracts ; and public administration applications .  ICT applications are increasing the efficiency of public services in areas such as automated or computer-assisted translation ; one stop shopping for government information ; applications designed to limit environmental degradation ; citizens and emergency support services ; and services to support inter-community meetings .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
It was stated that strict liability was a deviation from the general principle of tort law whereby a person was liable for his or her own negligence and , as such , was accepted in national law for exceptional reasons of public interest , such as certain strict liability regimes of persons conducting unreasonably hazardous activities .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
A different approach was suggested , based on the discussion of the issue of liability of certification authorities , in the context of which it had been understood that , in the event of erroneous identification of a person or erroneous attribution of a public key to a person , the certification authority would be held liable for the loss sustained by any injured party unless the certification authority could demonstrate that it had exerted its best efforts to avoid the error ( see above , para .  58 ) .  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
Constant dialogue among the main social , economic and political actors will be necessary in order to move forward effectively on such basic issues as land , taxation , justice , public security , decentralization , local development and multiculturalism .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
However , while recognizing the important potential in innovative financial packages and new types of public-private partnerships , the Panel emphasized the continuing importance of international public finance and of existing commitments to it , and the need to promote the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
It encompassed detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which had been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
Thirdly , even allowing , though not conceding , that issues of international humanitarian law should be negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament , our methods of work do not guarantee that we will attain the aim of totally abolishing anti _ personnel landmines with the speed required by international public opinion because more than 25,000 innocent people are falling victim to these indiscriminate weapons each year . 
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
Reaffirming that the initiative on the pilot management scheme presented by the ECLAC secretariat is aimed at strengthening the role of the organization as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ,  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
Taken together , these developments have posed major dilemmas regarding the professional behaviour and values of the public service : How can such traditional administrative values as accountability , fairness and integrity be reconciled with new citizenship values - transparency , responsiveness and responsibility - and with such managerial values as performance , efficiency , and results ?  
In any event , the conditions under which social services are provided must be determined by the State and reflect the rights of citizens , not simply be the result of a private contractual relation between individuals and private firms .  30 .  The State must reclaim the central role in the formulation of public policies , which it sometimes has lost to the private sector and international financial institutions .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
Before the astonished eyes of a silent public , we have in recent years been able to " see " the gravest violations of the right to life for ethnic and racial motives , death from hunger in atrocious conditions of thousands upon thousands of children and people of all ages , in short , atrocities that in the old world with less intercommunication only came to be known many years later through books and distant reports , and were sometimes never known at all by the public .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
However , although the National Civil Police is a professional public security body with the potential to execute modern and democratic public security policies , the model established by the peace accords has not been consolidated without the occurrence of distortions .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
The Secretariat will further be required to assist developing country Parties , on request , particularly those in Africa , in the preparation of their national , subregional and regional communications ; to analyze , collate and present those communications so as to facilitate their consideration by the COP ; to facilitate the consultative and coordination processes as set out in the relevant regional implementation annexes ; to ensure coordination with the secretariats of other relevant bodies ; and to assist in promoting public awareness of the Convention to Combat Desertification ( CCD ) .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
Those delegations stressed the importance of disseminating information on the activities of the Organization throughout the world and the strategic role played by the Department of Public Information as information disseminator in order to enhance the image of the Organization and to promote an informed understanding of the work of the United Nations among the peoples of the world , through the implementation of mandated programme activities .  3 .  A number of delegations expressed their appreciation for the efforts made to streamline and restructure public information programmes , in the light of the reduction in resources .  
Basic surveys and studies for administrative reform were continued , and action on a number of issues is under active consideration , including the establishment of unified salary scales for the public service and restructuring of the civil service with employment based on qualifications and equal opportunity .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
The promotion and maintenance of the child 's health through strengthened safe motherhood ; breastfeeding , and improved weaning ; universal immunization ; control of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections ; and other existing public health programmes . 
For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
The Joint Border Commission continues to meet on a regular basis and to focus on resolving the disputed border areas it had previously identified , but the results of its work have thus far fallen short of the expectations and the public statements of intent of the two parties in this regard .  
As they moved along the path of reform , their objectives became more complex and ambitious , shifting from the limited concerns of macroeconomic imbalances and stabilization to the promotion of development by a plethora of market-oriented reforms , including the improvement of economic efficiency , curbing of public sector intervention , encouragement of the private sector and liberalization of the external trade sector .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
Consider the feasibility of establishing an international fund to support activities for sustainable forest management ; and explore innovative ways both to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and to generate new and additional public and private financial resources ;  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .  
Judge Murphy proposed that any organization which purported to be religious and whose belief and practices were reminiscent of or reflected ancient forms of worship could claim to believe in one or more supernatural beings , a god or an abstract entity and would be regarded as a religion . religious schools were contrary to article 116 of the Constitution , since such public funding was granted without distinction between the various religions and was therefore not tantamount to the establishment of a religion .  
Whenever health supplies received under resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are sold through private sector pharmacies , equitable distribution requires uniform and transparent pricing that is not excessive in comparison with fees levied in public pharmacies , valid medical prescription and guarantees that the use of private sector pharmacies does not unduly disadvantage those who can not afford to purchase the drugs they require .  
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
An independent and powerful judiciary should have the capacity to establish sustainable lasting and autonomous control policies independent from the executive and legislative branches , with a clear responsibility oriented to public service , responding in an opportune , impartial , balanced , effective and transparent manner to all demands that are placed before it .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
Because of inadequate flow in the dry season , these drains represented a health hazard and generated offensive odours and fly and mosquito infestation ; in the rainy season they flooded pathways and public places , increasing the risk of water-borne disease .  
The main objectives of the Institute are : to raise public awareness for human rights ; to further educate civil servants , teachers , lawyers on human rights ; to strengthen human rights education in the Cyprus educational system at all levels ; to strengthen the capacity of the mass media for human rights education by appropriate means ; to promote the active engagement of national non-governmental organizations in the realization of the goals of the Decade ; and to establish a human rights library in order to enhance public awareness .  
The Special Representative notes that in the past , senior officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran have attempted to distinguish between the act of private worship , which is permitted , and more public acts such as teaching , forming assemblies and working with the administration of the Baha'i community , which were forbidden on the grounds that those were hostile and conspiratorial acts that were criminal in nature .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
It can be achieved only through a multidimensional and integrated approach that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities and public services , enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
Any person may take quick , expedient action to protect himself , as long as no other more appropriate judicial means exist , against any immediate or potential act or omission of public authorities or any individuals , harming , restricting , altering or threatening rights and guarantees recognized by this Constitution , by a treaty or by a law , in either an arbitrary or a manifestly illegal manner . . . .  
At that time , the restructuring process was fully under way in both the private and public sectors , with the addition of new technologies and production , distribution and marketing processes , a significant increase in productivity resulting from the stability and with a change in the previous economy 's suffocating rules of the game , such as the cheapening of capital goods and the disappearance of inflation as an instantaneous means of relaxing labour costs .  
The reform of the national Government is also continuing and being extended to the provincial governments , the tax system is being strengthened and the efficiency of public spending in the social sphere increased at all levels of government .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
The speaker said that significant changes would be required in order to increase the flow of FDI to a meaningful size in areas such as governance , development of an enabling policy environment and sustained policy reforms , and an improved partnership between the public and private sectors .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training , in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse , which should include raising public awareness on the detrimental effects of drug abuse ;  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
Subsequently , the importance of managing wildfire hazards became the dominant policy promoted through the collaborating interests of public authorities , commercial interests and local commitments driven by a combination of balanced economic , social and ecological values .  
While the idea of an international criminal court had been on the international agenda for centuries , the past few years had seen promising developments , arousing more enthusiasm for the process than ever before , as evidenced by the constant increase in the number of countries favouring the early establishment of such a court .  That increase was encouraging , as was the growing public awareness of the need for perpetrators of heinous crimes to be brought to justice .  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
The projects evaluated were selected through a weighted combination of such criteria as innovative design for formulation of public policies , relevance of project strategies for programme areas and sub-offices , emerging priorities ( e.g . , child labour , AIDS ) , potential for intersectoral integration , a child rights framework , national and local impact and replicability and sustainability of results .  
However , in todays conditions , where instantaneous reporting has such a profound influence on public opinion , and sustained and focused false reports can distort reality beyond recognition , there is need for a prompt response to set the record straight .  
It has also had a deleterious impact on the body politic , weakening further the authority of the State , eroding the little confidence enjoyed by the executive and the legislative branches and increasing public disillusion and cynicism vis - - vis politicians and political parties .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
It should be borne in mind that the expanded verification role of MINUGUA covers a package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and URNG , which include detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which are bound together into a national peace agenda . 
At the international level there is a public information strategy the aim of which might be described as consciousness-raising , including straightforward dissemination of information on the humanitarian consequences of landmine use as well as advocacy designed to assist the process of imposing a global ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , employment generation , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
As public gatherings are considered by individuals and groups as the last remaining alternative means to express publicly differing views and opinions , given the denial of access to Government _ controlled media and the harassment of the independent press , the direct and indirect limitations presently imposed on such events must be considered highly undesirable .  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
It emphasizes promoting healthy habits in schools ; rekindling the commitment of local governmental units , non-governmental organizations , and the private and public sectors to make lodging facilities , food establishments and marketplaces more sanitary and healthful ; and promoting healthy workplaces , non-polluting vehicles and clean and sanitary streets .  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities " .  
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
Hence , should the right to reparation be limited to gross violations , the correct wording under public international law would be : gross violations of human rights and grave breaches and other serious violations of international humanitarian law .  
Prisoners in chain gangs were reportedly required to perform heavy manual labour , such as rock-breaking or clearing rubbish from the highway , while shackled together ( or with their own legs chained together ) with metal chains , exposed to the public .  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
The Advisory Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 of the statement of the Secretary-General on programme budget implications ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
The European Union accordingly supports unreservedly MINUGUA activities aimed at strengthening Guatemala \ x { e5b8 } institutions ; those activities focus most particularly on the legal system , public security , and the promotion of a multicultural , multilingual and multiethnic State , on education and promotion regarding the peace agreements and their dissemination , and on the creation of a national climate conducive to respect for human rights .  
It was reported that , unlike traditional publicly funded projects , in which the Government was responsible for the entire implementation of the project , including for obtaining financing and guaranteeing its repayment , in the case of privately financed infrastructure projects the Government engaged a private entity to develop , maintain and operate an infrastructure facility in exchange for the right to charge a price , either to the public or to the Government , for the use of the facility or the services or goods it generated .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that various forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to reallocate the resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
Considering that parliamentarians can contribute substantially to sustainable development by promoting legislative changes , improving public policy and strengthening institutions for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda2 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements13 at the local , national , regional and international levels ,  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing , a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , the sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
While India is forging ahead with its policy of economic reform and liberalization , public policy is being re-oriented towards supporting agricultural growth , building up infrastructure and ensuring universal access to basic minimum services like health , education , drinking water , food and nutrition , shelter and so on .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
And without belittling the value and potential of energy savings and of an expanded use of solar and wind power and biomass , I am also convinced that in the intensifying search for energy sources which produce little or no greenhouse gases , more Governments and broad segments of the general public will rediscover the nuclear power option .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
It is in this context that Central America is developing a complex and lasting network of reciprocal cooperation for development which includes extensive and ambitious projects such as the privatization of public enterprises or the implementation of reforms intended to make its production systems more flexible , as well as the concerted decision to boost competitiveness and take measures to preserve and support its institutions .  
The constraints on tax administration in developing countries include insufficient skilled personnel , inadequate equipment , problems of supervision and motivation of public sector employees , inadequately defined or overly complex tax rates , difficulty in identifying taxpayers and in punishing tax evaders , and inadequate accounting practices .  
Volatile financial flows not only pose threats to the solvency of national financial institutions , whether public or private but also have the potential to destabilize the international financial system , given the increasingly integrated nature of world capital markets .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
The United Nations Department for Public Information ( DPI ) highlighted the important role of public information in raising awareness of the question of human rights and mass exodus , highlighting activities such as the production of print material , films , radio and television programmes and radio documentaries , as well as collaborating with NGOs and coordinating inter-agency promotional activities .  
The main activities are aimed at , inter alia , raising public awareness , improving understanding of money-laundering , promoting the adoption of relevant legislation , improving law enforcement capacities to combat money-laundering , training and developing infrastructure for the implementation of an effective money-laundering strategy .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
Numerous administrative circulars in the public and semi _ public services and authorities lay down discriminatory treatment for the immigrant population , among them ANPE ( the National Employment Agency ) , ASSEDIC ( Family Allowance funds ) and the Social Security Offices , which are required to carry out special checks and to demand supporting documents and even systematically to inform on immigrants to a specialized department in the prefectures .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Beginning in October 1996 , the Act has been the subject of an energetic explanatory and awareness _ raising campaign directed at all sectors of the Rwandan population : the administration and the public , urban and rural sectors , judicial and prison personnel and detainees .  
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
It also runs specific projects related to : the use of infrared imagery for public agencies , academic and other research institutions ; thermal loss in urban areas ; and the use of NOAA satellite images for the operational definition of cloud systems .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peacekeeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peacekeeping operations are conducted .  
The Independent Expert observed the progress made with regard to civil and political rights , identified weaknesses in the justice system and public security and drew attention to the need to find lasting solutions to problems affecting economic and social rights .  
Torture is defined in the latter Declaration as any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons .  
Further , where persons are displaced in circumstances which are consistent with international norms , they have a right to live in conditions in which basic rights to food , housing and health are secured , not to speak of reasonable social amenities and the enjoyment of all other basic rights to life , physical security and public freedoms .  
An express and clear incitement to hatred or to the use of violence that poses a clear and imminent danger to the legitimate interests of the State and all of its citizens calls for the State to take strong action to protect all human rights as well as national security and public order , bearing in mind the necessity and proportionality of those measures in relation to the threat posed .  
The Government faces a very difficult task and heavy responsibility in its obligation to protect all citizens of the Turkish Republic from the scourge of terrorism while simultaneously protecting all human rights of all the people of Turkey . 55 .  Secondly , while the press and other media are vivid , the Special Rapporteur finds that , at times , the press is not inspired by a vision of itself as a professional force that serves to inform all members of the public .  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
Whereas in almost all countries of the world , with the exception of two , women have the legal right to vote and to hold public office on an equal basis with men , in practice relatively few women have been elected to national legislatures , and even fewer occupy key decision-making positions , including in international organizations such as the United Nations .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
The effort has attracted strong and high _ level political support from a large number of countries ; it is overwhelmingly supported by the public , leading NGOs and a growing band of senior military figures .  
Even though it is more complete than article 47 of Additional Protocol I , it does not differ much from that text as far as the definition of a mercenary is concerned and it lends itself to different and perhaps contradictory interpretations , when it is States themselves that , on the initiative of their Governments , hire private firms to perform services connected with public order and security . 
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of the present Declaration ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , the private sector , cooperatives and the civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
Constraints to external communication and public affairs identified through the change management exercise were : ( a ) unclear policy messages in written and oral communications , which are frequently jargon-ridden and lacking in hard facts ; ( b ) uneven collaboration between DPA and line units ; ( c ) a media-shy culture in UNDP as a whole ; and ( d ) insufficient financial investment in communication .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs , criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Recommends that long-term public awareness and information programmes related to natural disasters , including those induced by El Ni �� and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , be integrated into comprehensive national disaster management programmes that focus on preventive strategies for risk reduction and that those programmes be included as integral elements of United Nations support for social and economic development programmes ;  
Jordan also supported resolution 51 / 210 , in which the General Assembly had renewed its affirmation that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstance unjustifiable .  
The conferences , held in South Africa , focused on reorganizing the judiciary ; adopting a bill of rights ; developing affirmative action programmes ; designing a nationwide public defender service ; comparing institutional models for enforcing a constitutional guarantee of gender equality , and evaluating electoral systems .  
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments , and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , generation of employment , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
They had urged the development of Israeli / Palestinian / NGO cooperation , based on mutual understanding and commitment to a comprehensive , just and lasting peace , and had pledged to generate public support for the Palestinian people through campaigns focusing on the themes of the future of Jerusalem , Israeli settlements and their expansion in East Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza , and the Palestinian refugees ' right of return .  
UNHCR \ x { e5b8 } promotional activities sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , as well as to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to UNHCR , including through their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .

The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework .

However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .

Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .

It was pleased to note that many countries had taken legal measures to eliminate cultural , religious or traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , that violated the human rights of women and girls.Although in keeping with the duty of States to protect all human rights , such actions were insufficient by themselves to end those practices and should be supplemented with education and public awareness campaigns .

To consolidate democracy through the promotion of pluralism , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , maximizing the participation of individuals in decision-making and the development of competent and public institutions , including an independent judiciary , responsible legislature and public service and an electoral system that ensures periodic , free and fair elections ;  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
Points of public concern include matters such as continuity in the provision of public services ; adherence to environmental protection , health , safety and quality standards set by the host country ; fairness of prices charged to the public ; non-discriminatory treatment of customers or users , full disclosure of information pertaining to the operation of infrastructure facilities and the flexibility needed to meet changed conditions , including expansion of the service to meet additional demand .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In cases where public ownership and control is desired , direct private financing as well as infrastructure operation under commercial principles may be achieved by establishing a separate legal entity controlled by the Government to own and operate the project .  
Where the facility is operated pursuant to a governmental licence , private ownership of physical assets ( e.g . a telecommunication network ) is often separable from the licence to provide the service to the public ( e.g . long-distance telephone services ) , in that the licence can be withdrawn by the competent public authority under certain circumstances .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant public authority conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
In order to achieve the desired level of independence it is advisable to separate the regulatory functions from operational ones by removing any regulatory functions that may still be vested with the public service providers and entrust them to a legally and functionally independent entity .  
In countries where the law contemplates more than one type of procedure for compulsory acquisition , it may be desirable to authorize the competent public authorities to carry out all acquisitions required for privately financed infrastructure projects pursuant to the most efficient of those procedures , such as the special procedures that in some countries apply for reasons of compelling public need ( see chap .  
While rules of private international law often allow considerable freedom to choose the law governing commercial contracts , that freedom is in some countries restricted for contracts and legal relationships that are not qualified as commercial , such as , for instance , certain contracts entered into by public authorities of the host country ( for example , guarantees and assurances by the Government , power purchase or fuel supply commitments by a public authority ) or contracts with consumers .  
The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
Achieving an efficient system of services may require innovative modes of provision that entail an adequate mix of public , private and non-profit participation and mobilizing new resources from the supply side ; basic social services should be financed through taxation , not user fees , which , in many cases , never revert to the facilities for which they were intended ;  
The opening of many countries to global financial markets has created situations in which Governments , at both local and national levels , have new access to opportunities to borrow , yet many of the officials concerned have little or no experience with the workings of financial markets and no accurate concept of their abilities to repay the loans.This has led to numerous cases of potential public default or bankruptcy .  
That provision had been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly with regard to the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .  
Corruption in both the public sector and the private sector , regardless of the level at which it occurs , can jeopardize free trade , distort competitiveness and undermine the stability upon which the free market system is based . 12 Companies may resort to bribery as a means of bypassing existing trade barriers or reducing national tariffs and expediting international trade .

Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Stresses however its deep concern about the continued repression of members of the political opposition and about the detention of dissidents and all other persons detained or imprisoned for peacefully expressing their political , religious and social views and for exercising their right to full and equal participation in public affairs , and calls upon the Government of Cuba to release all those persons ;  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures , including legal and judicial measures in order to bring an end to impunity , to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
An integrated approach to development , including consistency in policy-making , drawing upon synergies of different policy areas and comparative advantages of different actors , leading to an effective mobilization of financing for development from both public and private sources , is crucial for achieving the international development targets .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
The role of the private sector in the implementation of the UNFF plan of action could be twofold : first , as an important implementing agent of specific IPF / IFF proposals for action that are specifically addressed to the private sector ; and second , as a crucial financing source to complement national and international public funds .  
However , IFF recognized that private sector investment should not be considered a substitute for international public funding , including ODA . 11 In addition , the IPF / IFF process recognized the important , but differentiated , contributions of the public and private sectors , while stressing the role of Governments in fostering an enabling policy environment . 
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
That delegation was of the view that sufficient advance information about the scheduled re-entry should be provided to those States in the area of the anticipated descent so that adequate precautionary measures could be taken and also that public anxiety could be alleviated .  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
How can the international community support national efforts to tap civil society and private sector resources to contribute to the provision of infrastructure and social services , so that public resources can be concentrated in other areas where there can be no substitute for government activity ?  
How to encourage all relevant national , regional and international policy-making forums to further pursue efforts to become more accountable , responsive and transparent to public concerns , as well as to review their composition and consultation mechanisms so as to ensure fuller and deeper participation of developing countries and adequate consultation with all concerned actor and stakeholder groups ?  
Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Request States to make a serious commitment to adopting more appropriate measures to ( a ) combat illegal acts motivated by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance against individuals , communities or groups of persons ; ( b ) protect victims of discrimination and provide them with security against future threats ; ( c ) punish those responsible for such crimes and violations of human rights ; and ( d ) make every effort to ensure that national and local public authorities act accordingly ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
The overall objective of improving public sector performance for the delivery of services in LDCs can only be accomplished through the creation of an enabling environment which will ensure effective resource utilization and partnership-building , promote effective society - wide participation and sustain the rule-of-law and equitable distribution of wealth .  
In addition , public sector performance also depends on ( i ) appropriate sectoral policies in key social areas such as health and education ; ( ii ) productive capacity enhancement , depending on a vibrant financial sector ; and ( iii ) the streamlining of legal and regulatory frameworks .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
We request you to intervene and to designate a time and place for the handover of this property without reference to the mechanisms established by Security Council resolution 1284 ( 1999 ) , whose true objective , as has now become clear one and a half years after its adoption , is to deceive world public opinion , to impose a long series of conditions on the lifting of the unjust embargo being maintained against Iraq and to rewrite the previous Security Council resolutions in a tendentious and unlawful manner .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
Governments , with the assistance of relevant United Nations entities , needed to adopt a long-term , timely , coherent and integrated AIDS prevention policy , with public information , life skills-based education programmes specifically tailored to the needs of women and girls , adapted to their social cultural context and sensitivities and the specific needs in their life cycle .  
I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
In order to promote informed decision-making by central , regional or local authorities in proceedings concerning accidental pollution of transboundary inland waters , countries should facilitate participation of the public likely to be affected in hearings and preliminary inquiries and the making of objections in respect of proposed decisions , as well as recourse to and standing in administrative and judicial proceedings .  
The international community , during the course of last year and still in the year 2001 , witnessed how the Pakistan military junta played host to public mass gatherings of terrorist networks of the region and the extremist religious groups of Pakistan on its soil , who clearly and explicitly proclaimed their agenda and expressed intentions for expanding their realm of influence in the region through setting up extremist and radical regimes in countries of the region .  
Aliens shall be equal before the courts and tribunals , and shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of any criminal charge or of rights and obligations in a suit at law .  
Participants considered that the limited space available for indigenous peoples in the media should be used to inform the general public and indigenous communities about what was happening on an international and national level regarding indigenous issues and to create understanding and awareness of indigenous cultures among the general public .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
These include the allocation of revenues from taxes collected in Kosovo to minority communities through the community committees at the municipal level ; the implementation of employment-generating projects in these communities ; improved public services and utilities ; the integration of the 24 local community offices as part of the local administration structure to ensure equal access to public services ; and provision of more educational and health facilities as well as social welfare benefits .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .  
For their part , most LDCs have pursued economic reform programmes set out in the previous Programmes of Action , including eliminating or substantially reducing tariffs and other trade barriers , liberalizing currency regimes , privatizing public enterprises , establishing and strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks and adopting liberal investment policies .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
With the highest rates of infection occurring in the age group of those between 24 and 54 years old , the productive capacity of the country is being diminished simultaneously with greater demands on our meagre financial resources , both private and public , for increased spending on care and facilities for the victims and to mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the disease .  
Acknowledging that non-discriminatory legislation and protective laws create a supportive legal and political environment for the success of public health development and national HIV / AIDS prevention efforts , the Latvian Government revised and adopted an adequate legislative infrastructure .  
By 2003 , establish national prevention targets , recognizing and addressing factors leading to the spread of the epidemic and increasing peoples vulnerability , to reduce HIV incidence for those identifiable groups , within particular local contexts , which currently have high or increasing rates of HIV infection , or which available public health information indicates are at the highest risk for new infection ;  
Protecting public health and nutrition , protecting the environment , encouraging technology transfer , advancing socio-economic development as stated in article 7 of the TRIPS Agreement , and promoting fairness and international cooperation are measures that - at least in theory - are conducive to the promotion and protection of human rights and the balance sought under article 15 .  
Under the CDI Americas initiative , the Inter-American Development Bank is committed to establishing partnerships with international , national and local public and private organizations according to the specific needs of the countries .  
We note with regret that certain media circles , by promoting false images , particularly of migrant workers and refugees , have contributed to the spread of xenophobic sentiments among the public and have encouraged violence by racist groups ; 96 .  We recognize the positive contribution the exercise of the right to freedom of expression ,  
We reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Urges States [ to adopt and implement , or strengthen wherever necessary , national legislation and administrative measures that expressly and specifically counter racism and prohibit racial discrimination , whether direct or indirect , in all spheres of public life in conformity with the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination without making limiting reservations and to review existing measures with a view to amending or revising national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals . 
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Also , the WHO Healthy Cities Programme aims to put health on the agenda of decision makers , build a strong lobby for public health , and develop holistic , popular , participatory approaches to dealing with health issues , bringing together all the development sectors in a strategic alliance in actions that can lead to a health transformation in creating healthy conditions in various physical environments .  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
The enabling environments component of the framework focuses on government actions , such as fair trade policies , removal of technical , legal and administrative barriers to technology transfer , sound economic policy , regulatory frameworks and transparency , all of which create an environment conducive to private and public sector technology transfer .  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
The Council also held the fourth special high-level meeting with the Bretton Woods institutions on two themes : development financing , in particular poverty eradication , ODA and debt ; and a move forward to a development-friendly international financial system : public and private responsibility in the prevention of financial crisis .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
To ensure that public resources have an impact on the living conditions of the target population , studies are being conducted in connection with the third phase of the integrated financial administration system ( Sistema Integrado de Administracin Financiera SIAF ) , which is responsible for preparing and executing the national budget .  The aim is to incorporate decentralized , autonomous and local entities into the system so as to enhance effectiveness and guarantee transparency in public administration .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Poor management of finances and public corporations has not been conducive to the creation of a favourable macroeconomic and institutional environment for stimulating the economic and social activities of households and enterprises .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The main characteristic of the period under review has been the large number of complaints of threats , harassment and intimidation against persons and institutions working for the protection of human rights , civil servants , persons involved in judicial proceedings and journalists critical of public authorities .  
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .  
As regards physical infrastructure , development partners committed to supporting infrastructure development , both through public investment and by facilitating private investment , and particularly for the creation of essential infrastructure to facilitate the functioning of liberalized domestic and regional markets .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
Stressing that , in accordance with article 27 , paragraph 2 , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) , of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the right to protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific , literary or artistic production of which one is the author is a human right , subject to limitations in the public interest ,  
Given the typically sudden character of natural disasters , and of the often total disruption of public telecommunication networks resulting from their impact , the provision of reliable , independent telecommunications links is a prerequisite for efficient assessment of damages , mobilization of resources , coordination of operations and acquisition of information for dissemination through information systems , such as ReliefWeb .  
Educational modules on international migration and development have been produced and included in social studies courses in elementary and secondary schools ; educational specialists have been trained in the application of the modules in public schools .  
Any future international information security regime should provide for a harmonized ban on the collection , storage , use or dissemination of information about a persons private life without his or her agreement and on restrictions to public access to information , except where sanctioned in law .  The globalization of the information area has blurred the traditional concepts of geographical , State and administrative boundaries or areas of jurisdiction that normally delimit national security .  
Everyone is aware of the critical role of the mass media in shaping public opinion on any question , be it domestic or international , and of its major responsibility to observe impartiality and complete objectivity in covering events such as those that took place in the United States recently .  
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
First , as the public sector retreats from commercial services , allowing the private sector to take the leading role , the public sector is assuming the role of regulator to ensure fair competition among service providers , protecting the consumer against monopoly abuse and enforcing quality and safety standards to protect the consumer .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established . 
The expected American military action on Afghanistan , backed by the support of the allied States , was launched on the seventh of this month as a response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last month , which shook the whole world with the heavy losses of the lives of innocent people , and the extensive destruction of a number of public and private properties it caused in the United States of America . 
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
Four distinct functional elements are delineated ( peacekeeping best practices and policy , public information , gender and peacekeeping and the Resource Centre ) , for which 19 new posts are requested ( 13 Professional and 6 General Service ( Other level ) ) , in addition to the current staffing of 8 .  
The Committee is aware of the importance of effective public information programmes in peacekeeping operations and the need to carefully identify and implement those programmes on the basis of objectives tailored to the specific needs of the missions concerned , including adequate resources for those programmes ( see A / 55 / 839 , para .  44 ) .  
The public expenditure level set under the national budget must ensure that the social and economic sectors are adequately financed , taking into account the absorptive and fiscal capacity of the economy over the medium term .  
The complexity of managing East Timors public finances is compounded by the need to obtain donor support for the two primary trust funds ( the first funds the national budget , and the second supports capital investment and recovery ) , while coordinating other bilateral and multilateral development assistance .  
The primary strategic objective of the Missions public information programme is to project , country-wide , the efforts of the military and civilian components of UNAMSIL in facilitating the peace process in Sierra Leone and the promotion of a better understanding of the mandate of the Mission and the activities of other international organizations that are operating in the country .  
Other requirements in the amount of $ 150,000 would provide for conversion of public information material to HTML for web sites in six official languages ; production of TV and radio products ; public information production costs for translation into local languages and events organized at the national / regional level by United Nations information centres ; the follow-up of the outcome of the Assembly ; the production of press kits ; update of the 1999 Ageing exhibit and production of two banners at the Assembly site .  
In the Declaration , ministers and representatives of new or restored democracies reaffirmed that the power of public authorities must be based on the will of the people , expressed freely in periodic , fair , pluralistic elections , free of intimidation , conducted by universal , equal suffrage and secret balloting and under the supervision of an independent institution , and that public authorities must be accountable for their acts .  
Given the deepening interdependence arising from globalization , holistic and participatory solutions should be sought and partnerships among the major stakeholders , donors , recipients and the public and private sector should be strengthened , in line with the initiative of the Secretary-General on the Global Compact .

In the United States , debates revolving round the NMD program are turning hotter , and voices of opposition to it getting louder , in the military and academic circles .  In their public comments , many " celebrities " and knowledgeable personages in society have noted that technically this program has its inherent flaws and poses national security and political dangers .  
In the past 11 years these public destruction events have taken place numerous times in China . Various localities have organized large-scale and forceful confiscation and destruction of obscene , prohibited , and illegally published materials with attention-getting success .  These actions have won high praise internationally .  
and so on .  In their joint communique , the two sides have pledged to develop the national economy in a balanced way by virtue of economic cooperation and step up bilateral cooperation and exchanges in social , cultural , sports , public health , environmental , and some other areas .  
Women 's federations at various levels have taken an active part in comprehensively improving public order and coordinated with relevant departments in waging such special struggle as " cracking down on pornography " , " cracking down on those abducting and trafficking in women and children " , and " prohibition of prostitution " .  
at the same time , an individual 's responsibilities and duties for the collective and the state are stressed ; all people are encouraged to care about the overall interests of the nation , be honest and keep their promises , be united and help each other , be enthusiastic for public benefits , and do more good things for the people and for society .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate , and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of firepower warfare and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered with by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war with firepower warfare .  
[ Wu Yuliang ] Since the beginning of reform and opening-up , our party has set forth the principle of taking public ownership as the main body and promoting common development of multiple economic elements .  This is determined by the basic national conditions of our country at the initial stage of socialism .  
In accordance with such a regulation that " the Hong Kong Garrison shall inform in advance the Hong Kong SAR Government before conducting training , exercises , or other military activities as well as activities concerning the public interests in the Hong Kong SAR " , the garrison has informed in a timely fashion the SAR Government or published in advance a public notice in the SAR Government Gazette in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong law before conducting an outdoor live-fire shooting exercise .  
The garrison has introduced an external spokesman system and has regularly held Open Day at its barracks with an eye on enhancing understanding or communication between itself and the Hong Kong public .  Practice has shown that the garrison has established fine , harmonious , and mutual-trust army-government relations with the SAR government and has forcefully safeguarded a high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Hong Kong SAR in such a special environment as " One Country , Two Systems " .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
The State Council recently held a conference in Shanghai on reforming the basic medical insurance system and pharmaceutical and public health system for employees in cities and towns throughout the country .  At this conference , the State Council expressly set out its general objectives of " providing relatively excellent medical service at relatively low cost and trying to satisfy the broad number of the people and the masses needs for basic medical service .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of fighting with firepower and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war by fighting with firepower .  
In addition , activities for " the great road of peace " , " unimpeded projects " , " mother for aiding the poor " , " be warm , be patriotic " , " outstretched hands " , " linked hearts " , " volunteers " , " public instruction system " , " social service pledge system " , etc . have been launched .  
Some localities have established " morality appraisal discussion meetings " , organized " workers ' public explanation groups " , held " city and town forums " and " instruction classes by experienced elderly Party members " , carried out " neighborhood Party member contact cards " and " systems for volunteer service time deposits " for bringing into play the role of the " five elderly " elderly cadres , elderly teachers , elderly workers , and elderly model workers .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
Originally he planned on staying a night in the United States and expanding his impetus and influence and gaining political capital by publicly meeting US pro-Taiwan congressmen and local overseas Chinese ; the United States , however , was worried that it would get into a deadlock with China , and stressed that during his stopover the new leader " can not have any public agenda " .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
As for inventing pretexts , complying in appearance but opposing in heart , refusing to comply with regulations , continuing to take in and spend - - all must be dealt with as soon as discovered .  Likewise for withholding , appropriating and siphoning off funds for private use .  Privately saving public monies , setting up " small exchequers " , and other such perverse and illegal activities will also be severely dealt with .  
Led bythe Clinton Administration over the past eight years , the United States has enjoyed economic prosperity , reinforced national strength , and won a series of diplomatic victories .  Though plagued by scandals , Clinton has maintained his public approval rate at more than 60 percent , a rare case among various previous presidents .  
The reason is that if a military attack fails to produce the desired result , especially if casualties of US troops are incurred , it will have a big negative effect on Vice President Al Gore 's quest for the presidency .  On the other hand , the American public has accepted Saddam as the " tyrant " who must be severely punished .  If no action is taken , the Clinton administration will appear weak , which is also not conducive to the creation of an image of authority for Gore .  
The investment in the project of diverting river water from the west to the east will total 2.9-billion yuan .  All these are projects with an investment of several billion yuan .  If there are no standard bidding , supervisory , and acceptance-check systems and if power operations and non-transparent work still prevail , how can we guarantee that there are no officials blinded by self-interests to take graft and there are no " scums " to do harm to the public .  
However , in terms of law enforcement and construction of the ranks of cadres , there are some problems that can not be overlooked : The effort made in cracking down on criminal and economic crimes is not responsive to the needs of the current severe public security situation .  
In particular , the several prohibitions laid down by the central authorities must be carried out .  That is , spouses and children of leading cadres at the provincial ( ministerial ) and prefecture ( bureau ) levels are prohibited from engaging in any commercial and business activities that may cause conflicts with the public interests within the scope under the administrative jurisdiction of those leading cadres ;  
Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory shine in the annals of the public , which have recorded the glorious course traversed by the people of all ethnic groups in their arduous struggle led by the CPC , engraved the great achievements made in the process of creating and building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and crystallized the wisdom and strategies of the party 's three generations of leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as their cores .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
On this happy occasion , we would like to extend our warm congratulations and cordial greetings to cadres and people of all nationalities and patriotic people from all social sectors of Qamdo and officers and men of the troops of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army , armed police , and public security troops stationed in Qamdo and our to all revolutionaries of the older generation and retiring comrades who had contributed to the stability and development of Qamdo .  
The Bush camp was obviously unhappy about Clinton 's " little tricks . "  Even though Bush could promulgate new administrative decrees to overturn the old ones , Bush , who has advertised himself as a " sympathetic conservative , " could counter opposition and lose public support if he tries to make major changes .  This is because Clinton 's administrative decrees involve mainly environmental protection and safety of work venues .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
However , some local criminal and vicious groups are rapidly developing and their activities are becoming more and more vicious in recent years .  They have been using extremely cruel measures , which seriously undermine public security in society .  They have gradually become destructive and harmful criminal groups of Mafia nature .  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
Their twisted and fallacious theories create great psychological pressure on many people , not only driving their followers to the path of death , making their wives and children walk out on them , breaking up the families , and ruining lives , but also seriously undermining public order , violating the law and normal moral standards , infringing on basic human rights and freedom , and lead to anti-humanity , anti-social , and anti-science crimes .  
The spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is incompatible with those corrupt ideas by nature .  Vigorously promoting this spirit can effectively sweep away such corruption and enable us to maintain a strong will to fight , to maintain lofty ideas , firm stances and the correct direction so as to formulate spiritual strengths , values and public opinions beneficial to the reform and construction .  
This is a hard battle and a declaration of an all-out war against the dark and evil forces .  It is also a vigorous test for the public security organs : in order to crack down , first the problem has to be faced squarely , the " protective umbrella " for the dark and evil forces has to be uncovered , and the intertwining network of connections has to be destroyed ;  
Under the leadership of local party committee and government and with the support of the broad masses of the people , public security organs at various places have carried forward the spirit of brave fight and persistent battle , hit hard , moved toward a good beginning of the special target struggle on " hitting the mob and eliminating devils , " and obtained preliminary results .  
We have to clearly recognize that the reason why the dark and evil forces can be so rampant in some localities is exactly because extremely few public security personnel or even government officials are acting as their " protective umbrella . "  This is an important factor which can not be overlooked in the struggle of " hitting the mob and eliminating devils " .  
As a rule , such U.S . official " human rights reports " flagrantly criticize the human rights situations in other countries .  They cite hearsay of one kind or another , but can not present any valid evidence .  Because of this , the reports have been regarded by international public opinion as a combination of " misinformation , exaggerations , groundless accusations , and lopsided and arbitrary conclusions " .  
At around midnight yesterday , under unified arrangement of the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Department of Hubei Province , policemen from public security organs of Wuhan City were out in full force and doing their utmost to carry out a comprehensive and nonstop search for Jin Ruchao , the major criminal suspect in the Shijiazhuang explosions .  
The aforementioned three criteria can more or less provide a basic yardstick for the general public who are concerned with things of this category ; and if we view the matter against a more extensive historical background , we can see that orthodox religions also showed a number of imperfect factors down the ages .  
The main role of the government is to create a favorable macroeconomic environment for structural readjustment by improving macroeconomic regulation and control , pressing ahead with reform , restoring market order through economic policy , providing public services , and concentrating its energies on major projects .  
During his US visit , by extensively coming into contact with US leaders , senior officials , and public figures from various circles , Vice Premier Qian has stepped up dialogues and exchanges , sought common grounds while reserving or narrowing differences , increased common understanding , expanded cooperation , and implemented the important consensus reached between the two heads of state on jointly promoting bilateral relations .  
An editorial in Hong Kong 's Ta Kung Pao expressed the belief that during his visit to the United States , by extensively coming into contact with US leaders , senior officials , and public figures from various circles , Vice Premier Qian Qichen has strengthened dialogue and communication ; sought common ground while reserving or narrowing differences ; enhanced common understanding ;  
After escaping and remaining at large for seven days , Jin Ruchao , the prime suspect in a vicious explosion case which occurred in Shijiazhuang on 16 March , was finally rounded up in an escape-proof net cast by the public security organs and the broad masses of people across the country , and captured by public security police officers of Beihai City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on the early morning of 23 March .  
Ever since it was activated , a networked information system built by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has played a key role in intensifying a series of specialized struggles waged by the public security organs across the country , including " pursuing fugitives " , " cracking down on abductors " , " striking at triad activities and weeding out local tyrants " , and so on .  
Shortly afterwards , the local public security organs at all levels downloaded all sorts of information relating to the prime suspect from a specialized website created by the Ministry of Public Security , so that the broad masses of public security officers and men involved in this struggle quickly learned all details and accurate information relating to the prime suspect and information relating to investigations into the case as well , and this provided solid support for cracking the vicious " 16 March " explosion case in Shijiazhuang City .  
If we further analyze the reason why the effective running of the Western congressional system is commensurate with the social conditions of social pluralism in the West , we will find that multiparty politics goes in line with the pluralistic state of aggregate public opinion distribution .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
Over the past few years , the public security organs have adopted resolute measures to " strike at triad activities or weed out local tyrants ; " have ruthlessly cracked down on all types of illegal or criminal activities by cracking one batch of major or serious cases after another or rounding up in the net of law one criminal guilty of flagrant crimes after another ; and have thereby upheld justice , deterred crimes , or maintained social stability .  
The public security organs across the country should adhere to the principle of striking hard by ruthlessly cracking down on all types of criminal activities in accordance with the law .  At the moment , we should especially concentrate on cracking down on crimes of extreme violence , organized crimes , drug-related crimes , gun-related crimes , or explosive-related crimes and should resolutely weed out all criminal elements swollen with arrogance .  
This is so because , first , radical and emotional nationalism directly appeals to " first principles of survival " and attacks all dissenting voices as threats to national survival ; in this way , it attempts to exclusively occupy intellectual and public opinion commanding heights , so as to become the dominant speech prevailing over all other human values and the virtual " supreme command . "  
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .  
It is understood that " sewage charges " are charged according to the monthly water consumption of enterprises ( including foreign-invested enterprises and units ) and different rates are imposed on industrial enterprises , tertiary enterprises and public institutions .  " Sewage charges " on enterprises that have not yet met environmental protection standards are several times higher than for enterprises that are up to standard .  
On 30 March , Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori told the visiting Renmin Ribao delegation that the Japanese Government 's basic approach to history and the events in the past is , as expressed by former prime minister Murayama in a speech that was decided by the cabinet meeting to make public in 1995 , that Japan expresses its deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the serious harms and pains caused by Japan 's colonial rule and aggression to the people in many countries , especially various Asian countries .  
The CSRC requested that based on the requirements contained in this guidance securities companies conduct a review of the lead underwriting they have done in the year 2000 for initial public offering , additional issues of stock , and allotments by listed companies .  
The conference demanded that the whole party and all levels throughout the country make common efforts and devote great energy to resolve the current conspicuous problems in public order , resolutely achieve the objective of bringing about a marked turn for the better in public order within two years , properly ensure that the masses can live and work in peace and contentment , properly preserve the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and provide an effective guarantee for socialist reforms and opening up and modernization .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
It is necessary to transform work style , practice the leadership accountability system , ensure that all work measures are in place , and gain new and marked achievements in public order work ; we must succeed in markedly lowering the crime rate , improving the public order precautionary setup , further strengthening the masses ' sense of security , markedly improving the all-round quality of the political-legal contingent , and achieving a big improvement in judicial backup work .  
The conference was attended by provincial , autonomous regional , municipal , and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps party committee secretaries , deputy secretaries in charge of political-legal work , political-legal committee secretaries , court presidents , chief procurators , public security department ( bureau ) directors , and directors of offices for comprehensive tackling of public order ;  
This is a major strategic disposition made by the party Central Committee and the State Council in light of the grim situation in public order currently facing China . It embodies a strong desire of the broad masses of the people and represents the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
can we crush the arrogance of criminal elements and boost the moral of the masses ; can we implement the various measures for comprehensive management of public security in real earnest ; and can we effectively ensure the healthy economic and social development .  
At the meeting , attendees diligently studied the important speeches of Jiang Zemin , Zhu Rongji , and other central leading comrades concerning the work related to public order , as well as the spirits of the national public order work conference and the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order ; and mapped out arrangements for launching a nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
It was decided at the meeting that beginning from now till the end of next year , public security organs throughout the country should , in close conjunction with the fighting goal set by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on striving to achieve a conspicuous improvement in public order within two years , immediately launch a vigorous and forceful nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that by making arrangements for unfolding a nationwide struggle to " strike hard " and put things right , the national public order work conference fully expressed the strong resolve of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to preserve social and political stability and the fundamental interests of the masses , and this will have a major and far-reaching impact on ensuring the smooth progress of China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization and achieving lasting political stability in the country .  
The economic and trade commissions at all levels must fullyunderstand the important significance of rectifying and standardizing marketeconomic order from the high plane of intensifying the work of public order , solidifying and developing the good momentum of national economic development , heightening the overall quality and competitiveness of the national economy , further opening wider to the outside world , and establishing and perfecting thesocialist market economic structure .  They should further enhance their senseof responsibility and sense of mission , and ceaselessly strengthen theirinitiative and consciousness in work .  
must perform well , under the unifiedleadership of the local party committees , governments , and public securityorgans , the work of administering or managing public order in areas under theirrespective jurisdiction ; and must continually step up infrastructure buildingat the grassroots level , work hard to raise the standard of law enforcement , strictly enforce the law , warmly provide services , and strive to attain such awork goal as " fewer crimes , good order , social stability , and satisfactionamong the masses . "  
From his election campaign , Bush was bent on pursuing a foreign policy different from that of the Clinton administration , and behaved in a hawkish style on many events to win support from the American public .  This time , shortly after the occurrence of the plane collision incident , he immediately selected the option of making a tough-worded statement on an open occasion , rather than dialing a phone call to Beijing .  
Liang Guoju , director of the provincial Public Security Department of Guangdong , called a special teleconference the other day to lay out tasks for public security organs throughout the province ; meanwhile , he urged all localities across the province to publicize in the coming few days each 's results in the comprehensive management of local social security , including the number of criminal rings of an underworld triad nature and the number of suspects that each locality had successfully smashed and arrested .  
At an earlier time , the authorities also issued a directive , urging the public to come forward and inform against lawbreakers .  Public security organs have already set up special hotlines and email boxes for tip-offs ; at the same time , they have also called on suspects to turn themselves in order to secure a lenient treatment from the police .  
International public opinion has focused on the fact that in this book approved by the Japanese Government , the " New History Textbook Writing Committee " has , under the slogan of making some " corrections to Japanese history textbooks ' tendency toward national abuse , " distorted historical facts and completely whitewashed its invasive war , denying the serious crimes that Japan committed during World War II . Although the manuscript was revised 137 times , its contents are still far from historical fact .  
In actuality , during the 1980s , given the pressure of strong public opinion assigning blame for the history books , the Japanese Government was obligated to set a neighboring countries clause in terms of its textbooks , promising these countries that the textbook question would begin from the point of view of obtaining international understanding and international cooperation , and would be given the necessary review and reflection .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
From China 's northern borders where spring is much in the air to southern China where trees are turning green and from the coastal areas where the ground is full of fallen flowers to the headstreams of the Chang Jiang and Huang He where snow and ice begin to thaw , the public securities organizations have taken rapid actions to form a huge and comprehensive anti-crime network .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
At the mass rally to openly mete out punishments to a batch of serious criminals in Chongqing Municipality , the public security bureau announced the arrests of 92 members of criminal gangs bearing the character of the Mafia , despotic hooligans , and suspected criminals in some serious cases , and announced administrative detentions of six suspected criminals .  
Central government organs and departments have held meetings one after another in the last few days to implement the spirit of the national conference on public order work and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech ; took active actions ; made arrangements for the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order ; and done an earnest job of rectifying and standardizing market economic order in close connection with the realities in reform and development .  
The State Planning Commission urged severely cracking down on serious criminal activities in the economic sector in active cooperation with relevant departments in carrying out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order , comprehensively strengthening public order and solving the pronounced problems facing market economic order , and striving for remarkable successes in this regard as quickly as possible .  
After the Chinese Government announced the release of the plane crew , raging public feelings immediately appeared on the Internet . Many Internet users posted articles to express their dissatisfaction over the government for " making a concession " to the United States . Some users even posted strong words on the " Renminwang , " such as " Li Hongzhang returns from the grave ; " " Ah Q style of victory ; " " The government is too weak , it has brought disgrace upon us . "  
Nevertheless , in each of their public statements , Chi Haotian and Zhang Wannian described themselves as " acting at President Jiang 's behest . "  The decision to release the crew before the Easter holiday was obviously influenced by suggestions made by the diplomatic system , and the timing was accurately controlled .  As demonstrated here , the PRC 's internal decision-making is rather rational , and Jiang Zemin is secure in his place as the commander .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  
We must fully understand the importance and urgency of doing a good job of public security work , earnestly implement the " strike hard " principle and various measures for comprehensive management of social security , which were formulated by the central authorities , and create a sound social environment for the state 's long-term political stability and economic development .  
To do a good job of the work of improving public order and maintaining stability , we must persist in advancing the work in a comprehensive way , while placing great stress on key areas and concentrating forces on solving pronounced problems and main contradictions with good results , and advance the overall situation of work by making breakthroughs in key areas .  
Only when strong pressure is always maintained on criminal elements and the haughty arrogance of criminal elements is crushed can social stability and public order move toward the direction of favorable development .  
At today 's pledging and mobilizing meeting held by the city public security organs in Urumqi City to launch the " hard striking " anti-crime struggle , Du Jianxi said that although ethnic separatists and violent terrorists were suppressed in most cases , they still pose a threat to social and political stability .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
In reality , logistics service forces are not merely limited to " hard " services , such as material supplies , public health services , repairs , transportation , and engineering , but they should also provide information and other " soft " services .  In this way , they are able to properly bring their joint logistics capabilities into full play at opportune moments and in proper places .  
It will also listen to and deliberate the State Council reports on strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing farmers ' income , on improving the social security system , on implementing the monetary policy , on cracking down on the manufacture and sales of fakes and shoddy products , and on stepping up public order .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : Strengthening the work of public security and rectifying and standardizing the market economic order are a major policy decision made by the party Central Committee and State Council to correct the present public-security problems and market disorder .  These two tasks are important measures to perfect our socialist market economic system , promote the healthy development of the national economy , and ensure social stability .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : Party committees and governments should proceed from their specific conditions , properly select the key points of the " strike hard " anti-crime campaign , effectively solve the prominent problems currently existing in the field of public security , and thus guarantee that the broad masses may live safely and peacefully and work happily and guarantee the general tasks of reform , development , and stability .  
First of all , leading cadres in the public security organs at and above the county ( section ) level must abide by the rule that their spouses and children are not allowed to get involved in the activities of independently running or joining others in running such entertainment businesses as singing and dancing parlors , game rooms , night clubs and such service businesses as bath rooms and massage rooms in the geographical areas where the leading cadres are performing duties ;  
As the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are expecting to further open up economic and trade exchanges on both sides of the strait , a public figure of the Taiwan authorities recently issued a thought-provoking statement that the continued rising unemployment rate on the island and the unfavorable economic situation would affect the time to relax restrictions on the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy and the extent of implementing this policy .  
To address the grave situation of the increasing number of crimes and frequent accidents involving illegal use of explosives and guns , public security departments will launch a special six-month action to confiscate illegal explosives , guns , and ammunitions throughout the country ; severely strike at criminal activities involving the use of explosives and guns ; and severely punish criminal elements involved in the use of explosives and guns .  
Since the beginning of last year , more than 400 outstanding young cadres have been appointed to the leading positions at the provincial departmental level in more than 20 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities by means of open recruitment from the general public ; meanwhile , more than 110,000 young cadres have been appointed to leading posts at all levels by means of competition .  
The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .  
The open announcements of verdicts on the trials of the exceptionally serious serial crimes of Zhang Jun and Li Zejun embodied the firm determination of the judicial organs to mete out heavy , swift and severe punishments on criminals in accordance with law and persist in dealing " sure , accurate and ruthless " blows on all kinds of criminal activities that seriously undermine public order . 
In order to firmly adhere to the policy of dealing " sure , accurate and relentless " blows to criminals , procuratorial and public security organizations in Chongqing and Changde made prompt preparations even in the investigation period .  Those organizations assigned key and capable personnel to investigate and detect cases in several provinces .  Public security organizations also quickly handed over cases to procuratorial organizations .  
The contacts of officials at high level are frequent , the exchange and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , cultural , public health , science and technology , and other spheres are expanding with each passing day , and the mutual support and coordination in the international affairs are unceasingly intensified .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .  
Supporting the Party 's principles , guiding public opinion in the correct direction , the overall situation of serving Tibet : these are three mutual relationships coexisting in a single entity ; this is a political demand the Party makes of its organs ' newspapers , the sublime mission of those who run the newspapers .  
The mass media carries important responsibility in literary and artistic criticism ; it must propagate scientific theory and advanced culture , mold a good spirit , magnify a healthy social atmosphere , and promote scientific spirit to create a good environment for public opinion in developing flourishing literary creations .  
Academician Pan said : With regard to the chronic effect of radiation , on the basis of analyzing and studying large amounts of the existing data , the UN Scientific Committee on the Radiation Effect of Atomic Energy has drawn a conclusion : apart from an increase in thyroid gland cancer observed among children exposed to radiation , no major members of the public have been found to be physically affected in relation to ionizing radiation 14 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident .  
In recent years , people at the grass-roots level have reacted to related issues on a growing scale and at an increasing speed in their expression of opinions and sentiments .  Naturally national sentiments constitute an important part of their reaction , and we would be overlooking the spontaneous side of public opinion by dismissing it as manipulation by top Chinese communist leaders .  
His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .

Do you still want to continue delaying ? "

Luo Gan pointed out : The judicial administrative work at the grass-roots level has close relations with the public security work .  In particular , the grass-roots judicial organs and the vast number of judicial officers are assigned to perform such duties as mediating disputes , giving publicity to laws , maintaining public order on the basis of laws , providing legal services , and helping and instructing people released upon completion of sentences .  
A series of social issues arising from the growing unemployment rate have emerged , public order is worsening , and the suicide rate is accelerating .  What is even more worrisome is that Taiwan authorities feel quite helpless about the issue of unemployment at this point .  According to official statistics , the unemployment rate will continue to worsen in coming months , and the unemployment rate during the peak unemployment season might even rise up to 4.5 percent .

Accompanied by Hubei Governor Zhang Guoguang and other comrades , Luo Gan conducted investigation and study of the progress of the struggle to strike hard and put things in order from 11 to 15 May . He inspected units such as police substations , criminal police units , prisons , reform-through-labor camps , shopping malls , residential living quarters , and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , and paid a cordial call to express solicitude for the family members of a model public security policeman who died while on duty .  
Luo Gan pointed out : Since the national conference on public order work was held in April , localities have attached great importance to and conscientiously implemented the important speech of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the spirit of the conference , taken swift actions and struck severe blows at Mafia-style criminal gangs in larger numbers , catching a great number of felons in the net of justice .  The masses of the people clapped and cheered at all these achievements .  
The " strike-hard " struggle is developing in intensity in all localities , public security organs at all levels are effectively cracking down on crimes , and initial results have been obtained in the special action to " prevent explosions and seize guns " and in other special actions .  A large quantity of illegally possessed firearms and ammunition were seized and destroyed , thus eliminating a hidden danger to public order , and a number of criminal gangs have been ferreted out .  
In the special action to " prevent explosions and seize guns , " the police of Zhejiang Province seized almost all illegally possessed firearms and ammunition , exercised strict control over trades and industries where guns and explosives might get lost , removed major hidden dangers to the safety of the public , and went all out to prevent the occurrence of explosions , criminal cases involving the use of guns , and accidents caused by guns .  
The Hunan Command has altogether spent 1,200 man-times for such tasks as cordoning off the crime scene , armed arrests , armed escorts , and armed patrol in the urban areas in coordination with the local public security organs .  The command has successfully handled a number of cases involving sinister and evil forces that were of relatively wider impact , including the Hengyang " 6 December " incident and the Zhuzhou City " 10 March " arrests and mop-up , capturing 12 criminals , seizing one pistol and 50 bullets .  
The Guangdong Command has successively contributed a total of 3,219 man-times .  By working together with the local public security organs in keeping a close watch at various key positions including stations , piers , town-and-country junctures , they succeeded in smashing 68 sinister criminal gangs .  A total of 6,737 suspects , including 318 sinister criminals and 47 chieftains of quasi criminal-syndicate gangs , were arrested , 2 hostages were rescued , and 153 guns , 953 bullets and 927 grams of heroin were seized .  
According to the incomplete estimates of the departments concerned , at present the armed police units , in coordination with the public security organs , have smashed nearly 1,000 sinister and evil gangs and arrested tens of thousands of criminals .  They have thus demonstrated the strength of the police force and given prominence to what is right .  This has held the sinister and evil forces deeply in awe and dealt a blow to their arrogance .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
After the national work conference on public security was held , public security border guards have taken measures to speedily launch the " strike-hard " rectification struggle , and severely crack down on cross-border criminal activities such as stowing away , smuggling , guns running , and drug trafficking , thus making positive contributions to safeguarding social and public stability in both border and coastal regions .  
The party committee of the Ministry of Public Security 's Frontier Guard Administrative Bureau has attached great importance to launching the " strike-hard " struggle .  To solidly and efficiently launch the " strike-hard " struggle , the bureau has established a frontier guard " strike-hard " leading group .  Various public security frontier guard headquarters have also established " strike-hard " leading groups headed by principal military and administrative officials .  
In this grand " strike-hard " struggle , public security frontier guards throughout the country have stressed their tasks in striking out at illegal migration .  They have formed a tight preventive line along the coastal regions and in ports to strike at the activities on " sea , land , and air . "  
Severely striking out at gun running and drug trafficking is a key task in the public security frontier guards ' " strike-hard " struggle .  Frontier guards stationed in China 's southwestern border areas , including Yunnan and Guangxi , have concentrated their efforts on destroying gun smuggling and drug trafficking gangs , cutting off entry points for gun and drug smuggling , and severely punishing the criminal elements who are involved in exceptionally large gun and drug smuggling .  They have speedily launched their special actions to crack down on guns and drugs .

Descriptions that distort history and beautify aggression have not been revised , and the textbook still adopts the basic theme of advocating the " historical view of the Japanese Empire . "  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
Li Donghai pointed out that in the past year the Taiwan authorities refusing to acknowledge the one China principle and sparing no efforts to deny the " 1992 consensus " reached by the two associations has led to a worsening and deterioration of cross-strait relations , and has also led to Taiwan being in a constant state of chaos .  The political and economic crises have worsened , the unemployment rate has unceasingly climbed upward , and complaints are heard everywhere from the majority of the public .  
Jeb , who had attempted to ignore rumors about him in the public , was finally unable to hold himself back and declared that he was absolutely loyal to his wife and they had helped each other even when they were in humble circumstances for 27 years and that the sex scandal about him and Henderson was " a terrible lie , " which might have been used to serve political purposes .

Jia Chunwang , minister of public security , recently inspected work in Guangdong and required that local authorities in all parts of the country deeply advance the strike hard anti-crime campaign aimed at cracking down on syndicated crime and criminal organizations with the Mafia characteristics , and in particular , resolutely deal blows at the infiltration of the external underworld .  
As a matter of fact , in analyzing the major cause to the chaotic political situation in Taiwan , the public opinion and some political and academic figures on the island pointed out in the same way without prior consultation : First , in the past year since the leader of the Taiwan authorities took office , he has not taken actual measures to relax and improve cross-strait relations and to dispel the people 's misgiving about his seeking " Taiwan independence " and this has caused the Taiwan society to have an unstable external environment .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
While the economic situation on the island is poor and the public eagerly look forward to being lifted out of depression and seeing unemployment mitigated , the Taiwan authorities have found a little " comfort " in the changeable international climate and impatiently jumped on the bandwagon of " containing China " of the international anti-China forces .  
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government leaders , including Jia Qinglin , fully reaffirmed the public security organs ' special campaigns and public order rectification work that mainly aimed to crack down on criminal underworld and evil elements , and that also aimed to severely crack down on serious violent crimes , repeated financial crimes , neighborhood crimes , and drug-related crimes .  
The relevant reports quote senior officials in Beijing as saying that US arms sales to Taiwan , the air collision incident , and public expression of the policy of defending Taiwan by force since Bush took office have caused certain people in the new Taiwan authorities to develop unrealistic illusions , holding that the mainland will not dare to settle the Taiwan problem by force and that even if Taiwan is independent , the mainland will not run the risk of starting a war with the United States in order to launch an armed attack on Taiwan .  
The Ministry of National Defense made public for the first time in 5 June the training of its " special operations " forces through its " Wuhan drill " .

In quite a few rural areas in Shanxi Province , there still exist the difficulties in traveling , getting drinking water , going to school , seeing a doctor , and so on at present .

Recently , the Chinese Communists ' high-level departments concerned , including the Central Political Science and Law Group , have proclaimed that the campaign to suppress Falungong has achieved fruitful results at this stage , adding that this is entirely attributable to the central authorities ' decision plus the " decisive and resolute " action taken by the public security sector .  
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
Governments at all levels and various government departments should make the basic interests of the masses of people the starting point of all work and take effective measures to solve difficult problems of universal concern to the masses of people .  At present , we should do the following three tasks well : first , it is necessary to effectively strengthen public security work and to go all out to safeguard social and political stability .  
First , as " the Le-cheng Program " is a highly confidential program involving top secrets , Taiwan 's military has had to implement the program without mentioning it in public , and Taiwan 's officers and men involved in the program also know very little about it .  As Taiwan 's media have of late published a series of unfavorable reports on " the Le-cheng Program " , Taiwan 's top brass are concerned that the public will not support the program .  
It is necessary to pay great attention to the management of scenic spots .  Houses should not be built at random in the vicinity of scenic spots .  Much less should cultural sites of historical interest be damaged or destroyed to build vulgar public places of entertainment .  
It is understood that in this nationwide special effort , Public Security organizations in Beijing , Hebei , Henan , Shaanxi , Jilin , Hainan , and Chongqing convened special conferences to lay out the work of rectifying and putting in order , and that they formulated plans for the work .

Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
The statement read : " This newspaper will learn a profound lesson from this incident and take effective measures to adopt correct guiding principles for newspaper management , thoroughly implement the principle of ' newspaper management based on political considerations , ' and improve newspaper management by adhering to the policy of fostering unity and stability , serving as an inspirational force , and stressing positive propaganda and by correctly shaping public opinion .  We will do our best to give wide publicity to reform , opening up , and socialist modernization . "  
It also believes the pro-unification forces , which once had the legal basis and rationality on their side , have basically lost their public identity .  It regards Chen Shui-bian 's tactics in promoting " Taiwan independence " is more secretive , cunning , and harmful than Lee Teng-hui 's .  Events of the past year have shown that the roots of the tense cross-strait relations have not been and could not be removed .  
Echoing and colluding with each other , the Dalai clique and the international hostile forces are returning favor with favor in their efforts to incite disturbances , plot explosions , and distribute reactionary leaflets and anonymous letters to viciously attack the principles and policies implemented by the party and state in Tibet and build up public opinion in the international community in a vain attempt to make the Tibet issue a hot spot of attention to the world public opinion .  
Since reform , the rural economy has undergone substantial adjustment .  However , the public ownership system still holds a dominant position , with farm output quotas being set for each household , and land , which is the primary means of production for agriculture , continuing to be publicly owned .  
Since S-2T antisubmarine aircraft still remain Taiwan Navy 's principal antisubmarine arms , in order to avoid publicly exposing Taiwan 's naval strength , the Control Yuan has decided not to make public its document and a relevant investigation report , both of which have been classified as " secret . "  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
Internet media should adopt a serious and responsible attitude and build a whole set of standard systems for posting news and information and guarding the door , and practice strict self-discipline , so as to provide true and accurate news and information for society , establish public trustworthiness , and build a good social image of Internet media .

He has repeatedly pointed out : Our propaganda and ideological front is a very important front because it concerns the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  We should persist in arming people with scientific theories , guiding people with correct public opinions , molding people with a noble spirit and encouraging people with outstanding art and literature works .  
We should strive for diversification of property rights through multiple forms , such as standard public listing of companies , mutual purchase of shares by legal persons , domestic natural person investment , foreign investment , conversion of bank credits rights to equity , market share subscription , stock right transaction , and the holding of shares by employees of a company , and gradually establish and improve a standard system of corporate governance .  
He said : The meeting conscientiously studied the important instructions of Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades on doing a good job in finding out and reflecting social conditions and public opinions , summed up and exchanged the experience in doing this work well , and set forth opinions and proposals on further strengthening and deepening this work .  
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .  
Now , we have adopted the basic economic system under which public ownership plays a dominant role in the national economy while other forms of ownership develop side by side .  We are shaping a socialist market economy and introducing strategic adjustments to the economic structure .  Consequently some workers have changed their jobs .  
Our source disclosed that in 1993 , tapes on the execution of prisoners taken from court archives were sold to foreigners by two public security and court officials at the price of scores of ten-thousand yuan .  The tapes were " edited " and combined with documentary tapes on kidney transplants at hospitals and then handed over to the western media for repeated airing just before the International Olympic Committee was about to cast its vote .  The negative impact was so great that it cost China its bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games .  
The incident greatly shocked the central hierarchy .  A top leader was said to be so angry that he pounded at the table as he rebuked the two public security and court officials for being decadent in the extreme .  He said that they deserved at least a-thousand deaths for selling their country for a mere sum of money .  
Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .  The possibility of buying or selling organs is close to zero .  It is even less likely that people will be able to buy organs for 200-500 yuan as the media reported .  
The links and procedures for competitive appointment must be improved and quantity graded method for such links as written tests , interviews , democratic polls and evaluations must be formulated , and examinations must be organized .

We must insist on grasping two links simultaneously and being firm on both hands , intensify the construction of spiritual civilization , arm people with scientific theory , guide people with correct public opinion , mold people with lofty spirit , inspire people with excellent works , and provide powerful spiritual motivation with reform , opening up , and modernization .  
So , it is of essential significance for the " Group on Adjustment of the Policy on the Mini Three Links " to establish an office in Kinmen . The DPP Central Executive Committee appointed Chen Chao-nan to take part in the Kinmen election by considering him a suitable candidate owing to his frequent visits to Kinmen to collect public opinion .  The party has its operational mechanism and will make proper arrangements .  
Over the past year since political power changed hands , however , it is most regrettable to find that the SEF has been totally frozen out , and the public can no longer see the scenes of Director Koo Chen-fu , surrounded by reporters , narrating his optimistic views on the future prospects of cross-strait relations in a mild yet firm tone . 
If administrative examination and approval can be replaced with the market mechanisms , then administrative interference should be stopped .  If administrative examination and approval is indeed needed , then it must be done according to regular procedures with intermediate links being reduced and with results being made public so that the use of power can be subject to supervision and check-and-balance .  The reform of the financial system should be carried on .  
Utilizing their advantages of having a strong capacity of sudden attack , people 's armed forces departments in Gulou , Taijiang , and three other urban districts have organized an ad hoc team composed of 1,000 militiamen to participate in the local " strike-hard " campaign and maintain social security in coordination with public security departments so as to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people .  
Second , we must throw ourselves into red-hot revolution and construct reality , research the actual major questions of the Party , the government and the masses , and provide an accurate direction for public opinion and support for spiritual intelligence for the great leap forward in Tibetan development and long-term political stability .  This is the glorious and important responsibility of workers in the social sciences .

We should establish and perfect rules and regulations for the information network security guarantee system and management mechanisms for effectively preventing the dissemination of harmful information through the net ; draw up rules and regulations for making government affairs public and expanding the channels by which citizens can participate in and discuss politics by means of the information network ; and draw up incentive mechanisms for guiding and encouraging the whole of society to carry forward China 's outstanding culture by means of the information network .  
We must accord full importance to the functions and role of public finance , implement a correct fiscal policy , and readjust and optimize the composition of outlays in a timely way in order to better serve the development of advanced productive forces and the promotion of the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
Third , efforts must be made to maintain the country 's long-term peace and stability by taking further steps to ensure fiscal outlays for public security organs , procuratorial organs , people 's courts , judicial departments and other law-enforcement organs , giving positive assistance to the departments concerned in strengthening the comprehensive improvement of public order , energetically consolidating economic order in the marketplace and strictly cracking down on major crimes .  
In carrying out such special campaigns , quality inspection , industrial and commercial administration , public security , customs , and other relevant departments should coordinate closely with one another , work in cooperation , and make every possible effort to achieve major results .  
After the launch of the " strike hard " campaign , public security organs in Hebei , Jiangxi , Guizhou , Hunan , and Sichuan , under the strong leadership of the various levels of party committees and governments , have overcome many difficulties , adopted firm measures , destroyed a number of organized crime groups , and arrested a large number of criminals who seriously undermined public order and who committed many evil deeds .  
Nevertheless , since it is hard to keep an alliance and public support unchanged for large-scale operations for a long time , in order to ensure a rapid and thorough victory over an enemy , the US ground force should , as it is suggested , rely on the support of an alliance , the team spirit displayed by combined or allied forces , and superior surprise offensive fighting capacity during a campaign .

Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult have the decisive nature of brutally injuring and killing people and causing grave harm to the state and the people .  However , with the pressure from the general populace and public opinion , this cult has been unable to completely expose itself and unwilling to let society and its practitioners understand the truth ; still less it dares to confront miserable facts .  
In regard to the petroleum , coal , fireworks , small arms ammunition enterprises and other companies engaged in production of easily combustible and dangerous products ; in regard to the airport , train station , wharf , fuel reserve , and other large scale commercial markets , as well as theaters and other public sites ; and in regard to aircraft , trains , passenger automobiles , cargo ships , and other critical installations , we must strengthen investigation and supervision , formulating a truly feasible incident response plan .  
Fourthly , while shoddy commodities are exposed , it is also necessary to publish and inform the public of the results of tests performed on quality commodities , to support the good and eliminate the bad , let the proper prevail over the improper , protect and support the development of advanced productive forces , and make counterfeit and shoddy commodities unable to find a foothold in the market .

The exceptionally large smuggling case recently cracked in Xiamen is among the worst smuggling cases ever handled ever since the founding of New China , for it involved an immense amount of money , showed complicated details , did severe harm to society , and left extremely bad impressions ; and the problems exposed in the case have proved a shock to the public .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
To reverse the situation in which many public resources ( especially those resources that do not regenerate and those whose growth periods are too long ) are overly exploited , and thus achieve sustainable economic development , a simple and effective measure is to grant the property rights of these resources to individuals or enterprises , clearing their property rights .  
Official polls in Taiwan chimed in with these views with ulterior motives and deliberately distorted the meaning of " one country , two systems . "  They deceived and threatened the Taiwan public by calling the realization of China 's national reunification a move to " make Taiwan accept mainland rule , " and describing " China 's special administrative region " as " a special administrative region of Communist China . "  
The province has fully exploited the material support provided for coastal defense and security management by rapid economic development .  Drawing on science and technology , Jiangsu has abandoned the past method of simply relying on patrols and inspections of beaches .  Instead , the province has included public order , production , transit , ships , ports , and military facilities in coastal areas into the land-sea-air comprehensive management system .

It has been learned that since the beginning of the second half of last year , public security organizations in China have expanded the number of computer information supervision personnel .  Big cities , such as Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and Chengdu , have followed the Ministry of Public Security 's instruction by enlarging their computer management departments or offices to become " Public Information Network Supervision Department . " The supervision work is also extended to public security sub-bureaus at the district level , which have established a section responsible for Internet supervision .  
The public information network supervision departments , which have been established by the provincial public security systems nationwide , recently held a meeting , summing up their work results over the past year .  The meeting said : Since their establishment , the public information network supervision departments across the country have successfully cracked down on Internet crimes and stopped the spreading of " harmful information " through the Internet . Internet police of the supervision centers in Guangdong , Fujian , Sichuan , and other places have successfully discovered many criminal cases from e-mails .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
They should devote more efforts to guiding the work , coordinating the efforts of various sectors , and solving in a timely manner the difficulties and problems that may be encountered in the struggle .  All police sectors and departments should put stress on the political work and the interest of the whole , uphold and carry forward the fine tradition of public security organs , coordinate closely , and cooperate wholeheartedly .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .

With regard to the current serious state of activities committed by criminal and evil forces , the leading central comrades have given important instructions on many occasions specifically demanding that the public security organs crack down severely according to law to totally eliminate the evil ;  
As important instruments of the people 's democratic dictatorship , it is the sacred duty of the public security organs to crack down hard on the crimes of criminal and evil forces , ensure the smooth progress of reforms , opening up , and economic construction , and ensure that the masses can live and work in peace .  
Measures should be taken to ensure that the salaries of staff and workers in the administrative units and public institutions are paid in full and on time , resolve the problem of salaries in arrears that exists in the units at county and township levels in real earnest , and further do a good job of the unified payment of salaries and financial expenses in the party and government organs and educational departments .  
At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .  
China 's economic development potentials and its vast potential market , the unique role it plays in Asian affairs , its political influence among the developing countries , its special geopolitical status and future prospects of " great China " [ da zhong hua ] , and the acceleration of its military modernization - - all these factors mean that the US government and public can not but attach greater importance to China 's weight in the future international political pattern and its influence in world affairs .

It was reported that although the military tribunal already accepted the accusation lodged by the military procuratorate against Ji Shengde , who had embezzled nearly 80 million yuan by means of accepting bribes and diverting public funds for other use and on charge of dereliction of duties , the tribunal has recognized the justification of Ji Shengde 's lawyer : First , more than half of Ji 's stolen money can be recovered .  Because Ji Shengde spent most of his stolen money buying luxurious houses in Beijing , whose prices are still rising now .

In those places , departments , and units where major criminal cases , public security problems and disasters , and social unrest have occurred , an investigation must be conducted to determine relevant leaders ' party disciplinary , administrative disciplinary , and legal liabilities .  It is necessary to exercise one-vote veto authority .  We must never allow criminals to go unpunished .  
The circular called for placing the focus of safety production work on coalmines ( with chief emphasis on preventing gas and coal dust explosions ) , on the transport of fireworks and firecrackers , toxic and inflammable products , on public entertainment districts , on civil aviation , on railway , on waterways , and on highway transport .  As the 2001 New Year and the Spring Festival holidays are spaced close within each other , the spring transport task will be very arduous and passenger flow will be very heavy .  
The police estimated that after the crackdowns in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first half of next year , they should be able to eliminate some of the larger local triads , fully curb the activities of foreign triads in the mainland , and bring about an obvious improvement in public order in the coastal areas .

Ho Hau-wah has forged ahead in pragmatic fashion and led the residents to overcome various difficulties ; a great deal of encouraging new atmosphere has emerged in Macao " ; " the SAR Government has effectively cracked down on various evil forces , public order has markedly improved , and the economic situation has consequently taken a turn for the better . "

They also have launched a special struggle against export tax rebate frauds .  The efforts to apprehend those suspected of committing major economic crimes and those who escaped have been intensified .  
During the July-September period , public security organs across the country , with close coordination of other departments , launched a campaign to tighten the management of places of entertainment and service .  They carried out a severe crackdown on prostitution , gambling , drug trafficking , and other social evils .  They also tightened the management of places where electronic games were available .  They have made contributions to improving the social environment and promoting a socialist spiritual civilization .  
It has been disclosed that the leaders of the Central Organization Department went in person to Shenyang and Dalian the other day to notify the leading bodies of Liaoning Province and Dalian City . People in the local political arena generally believe that a circular about the relevant appointments and dismissals will be transmitted and made public to lower levels .  
The meeting called on public security organs at all levels to act in line with the central authorities ' plans , actively participate in the joint operations to deal strict blows to criminal activities of manufacturing and selling fake and inferior commodities , and the special struggle to deal strict blows to the fraud of export tax rebates , evasion and cheating in foreign exchange payments , and other criminal activities .  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;  
The circular said : Currently and in the near future , the key tasks in implementing the policy of the great development of the western region are : speeding up infrastructure construction , stepping up ecological and environmental protection and building , strengthening agriculture 's position as the basic industry , adjusting the industrial structure , developing tourism featuring special attractions of the western region , and developing science and technology education and cultural and public health work .  
These are the key tasks in the development of the west now and in the foreseeable future : Accelerate infrastructural construction , step up ecological and environmental protection , consolidate the status of agriculture as the base , adjust the industrial structure , develop specialty tourism , and develop scientific , technological , education , cultural , and public health undertakings .  
To counter the problems that exist in the implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law , Hou Zongbin said , further efforts should be made to solve the problems of ideological understanding in a bid to genuinely change the erroneous law-enforcement concepts that exist among a considerable number of units and public security cadres and officers , such as " valuing a substantive law more than a procedural law , " and foster a law-enforcement concept of laying equal emphasis on both the substantive law and the procedural law .  
At the same time as this , the new authorities ignored the requests of the widespread public in Taiwan for easing up , improvement and development of cross-strait relations , and ignored the urgent requests of numerous industrial and business circles to quicken cross-strait economic interchanges and cooperation .  They still obstinately insisted on Lee Teng-hui 's [ Li Denghui ] " no haste , be patient " policy , saying one thing about cross-strait direct " three links " and meaning another , completely lacking sincerity .  
Also present at the commemorative meeting were responsible officials of relevant departments of the party , government and army at the central level , representatives of democratic parties and public organizations , journalists in the capital , as well as new and veteran broadcast workers .  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
Township and town enterprises should give prominence to the main theme of development , make effort to create a good public opinion , policy , and legal system environment , grasp the three key points of institutional innovation , structural adjustment , and technological progress , and effectively enhance their overall quality and efficiency .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
They sedulously arranged for the " Falun Gong " elements to spread the fantastic rumor about the Chinese Government 's persecution of the " Falun Gong " followers at the hearing on the so-called " human rights issues in China and Tibet , " held by the US Congress Foreign Relations Committee , and invited Li Hongzhi 's right-hand assistants and " pro-democracy " and " Tibetan independence " elements to attend the hearing on the so-called " issues of religious freedom in China , " to prepare public opinion for the anti-China proposal .  
It has been learned that among the cases in which leading cadres with party membership violated discipline and broke the law , a number of major and important cases which the masses were concerned about and which drew strong response from the public were strictly investigated and those involved were severely dealt with .  
Public security organs at all levels should conscientiously enhance their sense of political responsibility and , with the spirit of being highly responsible for the party , people , and law , make further efforts to unify their ideas , inspire themselves with enthusiasm , adopt stronger measures , strike out with a powerful force , and firmly crack down on triads and evil forces to enable the people to enjoy a safe , happy , and peaceful Spring Festival and lay a good foundation for the work of public order in the whole year .  
We must not be faint-hearted and hesitant in dealing with the handful of criminals who , with ulterior political motives , held fast to their anti-government , anti-social and anti-people stand , and organized and instigated deceived Falungong maniacs to openly stir up trouble , disrupt public order , and undermine social stability in their attempt to undermine the cause of socialist modernization .  We must deal a resolute blow to them and punish them severely in accordance with law , and must not leave any openings for future trouble .  
Today , the Ministry of Public Security gave a report to some members of the National People 's Congress standing committee based in Beijing and members of the relevant NPC special committees on how the public security organs nationwide have been implementing the spirit of the 13th session of the ninth NPC standing committee , strengthening the building of the public security contingent , and , in particular , conducting " three educations " since the beginning of 2000 .  
By way of conducting all kinds of specialized improvement activities , some outstanding problems in the public security contingent have been resolved , the law-enforcing behavior of the people 's police has been standardized , the image and mental outlook of the contingent have shown rather manifest changes , and its overall quality and operational effectiveness have been greatly enhanced .  
In this way we can form and develop a positive and upward-looking public opinion environment throughout society , enable scientific theory and correct ideology to play the dominant role in social life activities , enable the cadres and masses to maintain good spiritual features , and continually consolidate and develop the basis of the common ideal of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in their united endeavors .  
We must continue to uphold the guideline of unity , stability , and drive , and of focusing on propaganda by positive example , propagate in depth patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , further do a good job in publicizing typical examples , providing guidance for hot topics , and carrying out public opinion supervisory work , support healthy practices and eliminate unhealthy ones , boost people 's spirit , and encourage people to strive ever upward .  
The DPP 's governing performance shows that the authorities have politically gone against the trend of the times and economically triggered a decline or recession ; enterprises , capital , or qualified personnel have kept migrating abroad ; and the mainland has become the third most ideal destination for Taiwan migrants , and this shows that over the past half a year or more , the public has gradually grown disillusioned with the DPP and has seen more clearly that pursuing Taiwan independence is likely to bring a threat to Taiwan 's security .  
The " Yining incident " occurred on 5 February 1997 , when nearly 1,000 young Uygurs held a march in Yining demanding that the government authorities release a number of young Uygurs arrested for writing an antigovernment article ; the march turned into a riot , with the young Uygurs shouting Xinjiang independence slogans and attacking Chinese and setting fire to the bodies of Chinese they had beaten to death ; large numbers of public security personnel and armed police came out to suppress them , and calm was eventually restored next day .  
He asked various units to work in close coordination , give full play to the advantage of joint struggle of all public security organizations , consider the work of tracing and arresting criminal suspects as a special task , make overall and proper arrangements , and strive to achieve practical results .  
The two governments and the two peoples always respect each other , understand each other , and support each other .  Cooperation between the two sides in the political , economic , public health , cultural , educational , and other fields has been continuously expanding .  In particular , high-level visits were exchanged more frequently between the two countries , and bilateral exchanges increased .  
The ulterior motive of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult in spreading rumors to confuse the public , breaking the law and creating trouble is to create chaos and social disorder in China , disrupt people 's normal work , study and daily life , and interfere with the central task of economic development , so that they can realize their political aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Chinese communist party and changing China 's socialist system .  
However , because of his complex social relations and numerous hatchet men , the public security department adopted a cautious approach by establishing a special committee , adopted high-tech means , and deployed several special agents to conduct the investigation under absolute secrecy for nearly one year to collect concrete evidence .  
The special police contingent of the criminal police corps of the Beijing municipal public security bureau is a specialized force formed in view of Beijing 's development into an international metropolis .  
While inspecting the contingent 's vehicles and other equipment , Luo Gan said : In cracking criminal cases , the public security people 's police usually faces extremely cruel criminals ; therefore , our criminal and special police forces should be very competent and skillful and well equipped in order to ensure that the enemy is most forcefully dealt with and they themselves are most effectively protected .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
As briefed by public security organs , the content of the confiscated illegal publicity materials included materials to publicize false reasoning and heresies of " Falungong " heretical cult , to instigate people to violate laws and create disturbances , and to viciously spread rumors to slander against the government and state leaders .  
The quality and efficiency of economic growth was markedly improved , financial revenue also increased by a big margin , the readjustment of the economic structure was being actively advanced , and reforms in all aspects were being carried forward in depth .  The scope of opening up to the outside world was further expanded .  Comprehensive development was made in the fields of science and technology , education , culture , public health , sports , and all other social undertakings .  
The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
Faced with this fact of utterly inhuman brutality , one has no choice but to become more vigilant and understand better the nature and harm of " Falun Gong " as an antihuman , antisocial , and antiscience cult .  The central people 's government 's adopting stern measures to ban it is not only entirely necessary and timely , but also accords with the most fundamental interests of the general public .  
First , give priority to preventing , cracking down hard , and punishing corruption in the antigraft , discipline inspection , procuratorate , supervisory , court , auditing , judicial , customs , public security , armed police , and army systems ; since these are state dictatorship organs , on the one hand the state has to ensure that they " eat imperial grain , " and on the other hand the state demands that they must fairly enforce the law and ensure honest government .  This is the precondition for opposing corruption in China .  
He pointed out : Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " evil cult have become a political tool of the Western anti-China forces .  To achieve their sinister political purpose , they spread fallacies to hoodwink the public again and again , instigated diehard " Falungong " members to incite mob disturbances again and again .  Now , they even took more desperate actions and went as far as driving obsessed followers to commit suicide .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
We should further intensify comprehensive management of public order , crack down hard on various criminal activities in accordance with the law , and wage a special struggle against " triads and evil forces , " with the focus on homicide , explosion , and gun-related grave violence crimes and gang crimes , as well as serious economic crimes .  
The comrades engaged in publicizing political and legal affairs and the comprehensive management of public order must solidly foster their political consciousness , as well as their awareness about the overall situation , responsibility , and position , continue to persist in highlighting the main trend , and uphold the predominance of unity , stability , exertion of efforts , and positive publicity in order to create a good public opinion atmosphere for reform , development , and the maintenance of stability .  
Leading comrades in charge of the work of publicizing political and legal affairs and the comprehensive management of public order in the party committees and the political and legal affairs commissions of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the central government , as well as the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps ; leading officials of the relevant units and departments of the Central Commission for the Comprehensive Management of Public Order ; and leading officials of the relevant departments of all major central news units were present at the meeting .  
Presenting a work report at the Fourth Session of the Ninth Sichuan Provincial People 's Congress , Han Zhongxin said : The Sichuan Provincial People 's Procuratorate resolutely dealt with crimes committed by public functionaries last year .  For the grand development of China 's west , it has made active efforts to create an environment for fair , clean , and efficient social management and social service .  
By appropriating religious terminology in their attempts to disrupt public order , undermine social stability , defy state law , and endanger people 's lives , Li Hongzhi and the " Falungong " organization under his control have become a highly influential evil force that poses a grave danger to people and society .  Their organizational activities and roles in society are despised by all normal religious organizations that preach good deeds to people .  
It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday . He said he did not mean Taiwan need not deploy the TMD , and he thought because Taiwan is close to the mainland , the early warning time is short , and even if Taiwan has a complete missile defense system , it still can not intercept so many short-range missiles from the other side of the Taiwan Strait .  
Mutually beneficial cooperation has been carried out and expanded gradually in the economic and trade , scientific and technological , cultural and education , and public health fields , and has achieved positive results .  
An ironic fact was that some local people even tried to " pick a bone from an egg " by taking advantage of Ma Ying-jeou 's visit to Hong Kong . They argued that the Hong Kong general public 's strong interest in Ma Ying-jeou 's visit was not derived from their concern about the motherland 's reunification and Hong Kong 's urban construction , but was derived from their interest in " seeing the mayor being elected democratically in Chinese society . "  
It is learned that running television stations in the name of the government is not a rare phenomenon in the townships and towns around Lankao and Dongming . Because it is so common , the local public have grown accustomed to the behavior of " Donglan Film and Television Station , " the illegal privately-run television station .  
Wu Banguo pointed out : Through the joint efforts of large numbers of cadres and workers in the information industry , remarkable achievements were made in such fields as separating government administration from enterprise management , reorganizing telecommunications enterprises , making initial public offerings abroad , improving relevant laws , promoting the building of an information-based economy and society , setting up organizations responsible for the management of computer networks and information security , and tackling difficulty technological problems last year .

Answer : Generally speaking , they will have to prepare themselves in the following three ways : First , they should change their rules governing trading in the B shares and make public on an earlier date concrete measures for mainland investors with legitimate foreign exchange funds to open a B-share account and a capital account ;  
Gao Changli was placed under the " double rules " because he took it upon himself to print quotations from Jiang Zemin ( purported to be distributed to all judicial officials across the country ) in his hometown in Shandong and because he illegally appropriated several Justice Ministry housing units for its public functionaries .  In addition to that , however , the most important reason was because he refused to sign the documents concerning the extradition of Lai Changxing , the principal suspect in Xiamen 's Yuanhua smuggling case who has escaped abroad .  
Furthermore , the relevant department has conducted the following special rectification on a large scale : Straightening out electricity charges ; standardizing payments of charges for railroad , traffic , and public security services ; stopping arbitrary ranking , arbitrary evaluations , and arbitrary inspections ; rectifying intermediary service charges ; curbing arbitrary collections of charges from foreign-invested enterprises ; bringing order out of arbitrary collections of charges related to traffic and vehicles ; and reducing town and township enterprises ' burden .  These have all resolved some outstanding problems many enterprises had strong complaints about .  
Li Boyong said : The " Draft Amendments to the Pharmaceutical Administration Law , " which has been submitted to the standing committee for deliberation for the third time , has clearer regulations on prescribed medicine advertisements .  " A prescribed drug is only permitted to be advertised in medical and pharmaceutical journals designated jointly by the State Council 's health administrative departments and the State Drug Administration , but not in the mass media or through other methods targeted at the general public . "  
He openly defied the laws , organized and instigated besieging of party and government organs and mass media institutions , staged illegal demonstrations and rallies , continuously gathered his followers at Tiananmen Square to carry out trouble-making activities , seriously disrupted the public order and sabotaged social stability .  
Talking about the relationship between handling Falungong and guaranteeing human rights , Liu said : The policy of the Chinese government in handling the Falungong problem is to unite with , educate , and saving most of the practitioners who have been deceived .  The Chinese government has punished a small handful of people in the Falungong cult because they have engaged in illegal and criminal activities , disrupted public order , and violated the Chinese law .  
At a news briefing held today by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and Ministry of Supervision , Yuan Chunqing , member of the standing committee , secretary general , and spokesman of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , briefed reporters on the party and administrative disciplinary actions taken against Li Jizhou , former vice minister of public security and former deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , and against other party members and state workers involved in the Xiamen extraordinarily large-scale smuggling case .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
A historical document made available to the public for the first time here shows that in 1945 after victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan , a representative of the then Chinese Government officially accepted the entire land and administrative right of Taiwan from the Japanese colonialists , who were occupying Taiwan at that time , thereby once again proving that Taiwan is part of China and that the so-called " theory on Taiwan 's undecided status " is basically untenable .  
In the recent period , Falungong has intensified its activities of disturbing and infiltrating Hong Kong society .  Besides putting up huge advertising posters in bustling downtown areas to propagate the Falungong cult , they also go to public places , or go from door to door and deep into residential areas , to forcefully distribute leaflets to residents .  They also rampantly send e-mail to the public .  
As pointed out by Regina Ip , the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa is no ordinary organization .  Besides being heretical and making people obsessed , it is also a tightly built organization with strong mobilization power and financial resources and is targeting itself directly at the central authorities .  Its activities have caused public concern , and it is also necessary for the government to pay attention to their activities .  
Representatives of central committees of various democratic parties ; All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , nonparty personages , and China 's five major religions as well as some special committees of the CPPCC have separately held discussion meetings to roundly expose and criticize the cult essence and various crimes of the " Falungong . " They support the government 's crack down on cults in accordance with the law to eliminate public nuisance and engage in firm struggles against the " Falungong " in various ways .  
in the context of public ownership as the main body , we must steadfastly develop economic sectors under varied ownerships , which is conducive to fully mobilizing and using social resources and boosting the vitality of the national economy as a whole , as they make up an integral party of the socialist market economy .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
This afternoon , members of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultation Conference [ CPPCC ] from the educational circle and the medical and public health circle held a joint group meeting .  Several committee members expressed their opinions on the current situation of public health in China , pointing out that China 's current public health conditions are extremely incompatible with the country 's status and socialist system , and should be effectively and rapidly improved .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;

Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .

The disadvantage is that a considerable portion of the value added to the property by new government construction will be skimmed off by the landowners , so that the ideal of " returning the value added to the public " can not be fully realized .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
Its administrative district was Taipei City , and in neighboring communities just across the bridge , an inch of land was already worth an inch of gold . But the ban on new development caused reluctance to proceed without construction of public works . Disordered , illegal constructions and dilapidated old red brick structures with leaky roofs are everywhere .  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
The 2:1 exchange rate of the Belize dollar to the U . S . dollar has held steady for many years , and inflation has been kept firmly under control - - a big relief when you consider the astronomical inflation and plummeting exchange rates of its neighbors . Immigrants from Taiwan also find it reassuring that Belize and the R . O . C . have diplomatic relations and that the economic assistance we are providing them has made us well liked by the government and public alike . "  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Hu You-huei , an associate professor of public health at the Yangming Medical College , revealed in a study that women have a higher incidence of acute , chronic , disabling , dental , and mild nervous conditions than men . "  
He satirizes feminine pettiness and cupidity , but he 's afraid to get into other areas . Playing the opposite sex is even tougher to bring off since guardians of public morality keep a close watch on the airwaves , and audiences are growing a little tired of it from overuse , what with Auntie Tung , Sister Wai , Old Lady Yang , and so forth , on practically every show . Hsiao Tung will gradually " recover his manhood " in the future , Pai Mei-hung reveals .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
The National Science Council 's Twelve-Year Plan for Scientific and Technological Development identifies its four main goals as upgrading science and technology , advancing economic development , raising the public 's quality of life and establishing an independent national defense .  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions . Making it new : Can traditional folk theater be combined with modern concepts and techniques to once again attract the attention of the public and reenter the life of the people ?  
The concept of fetal toxicosis originated in the ancients ' misunderstanding of rashes and communicable diseases . Red lead and cinnabarre still sometimes misused in Chinese medicine today , in spite of scientific evidence , resulting in heavy metal poisoning . I hope that agencies in charge of public health will extend regulation to Chinese medicine .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
In addition , when the representative group arrived in Berlin and found that the film festival 's daily publication was quite weighty , with the help of the public relations firm they made broad and friendly connections . Also , taking advantage of the timing , before the first showing of the film they invited important critics to a special preview showing .  
Yet , at present , national and communal woods of the mountain and river areas aside , there has been a longstanding lack of regulations governing the proportion of land allotted for building purposes , apart from on highways and in public parks . Development plans for residential and industrial-commercial areas still do not take into consideration the conservation and exploitation of green resources .  
To analyze the phenomenon from a sociological viewpoint , in olden times many couples were brought together by matchmakers , neither of them even knowing what the other looked like before the wedding ceremony . Thus the custom of the family invading the bridal chamber had the function of breaking down the feelings of unfamiliarity between the couple . According to anthropologist Ruan Chang-jui , it was also " a social process by which the joining of two people as one flesh was given public recognition . "  
In line with this policy the Ministry of Justice has prepared an Anti-Corruption Plan , the four main aims of which are to make public officials " afraid to be corrupt , unable to be corrupt , unwilling to be corrupt and free of the need to be corrupt . "  
Explaining these four aims , Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou says that making people afraid to be corrupt takes strict laws ; making them unable to be corrupt takes comprehensive preventive measures ; the way to make them unwilling to be corrupt is to instil in public servants a sense of honor in uprightness and shame in corruption ; and for civil servants to have no need to be corrupt depends on giving then adequate salaries , so that they can afford to stay clean , and do not need to rely on ill-gotten gains .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Actually , public and private schools have a deep connection . A few of the schools were established by retired members of the military dog training center . Also , when the police canine division was first formed , they trained both the people and the dogs by relying on the long experience of private dog schools .  
When Lin Chung-cheng , an Academia Sinica researcher in social sciences , examined the early economic differences between native Taiwanese and mainlanders , he discovered that native businesses tended to take root among the general public and situate themselves in downstream manufacturing , while mainlander businesses were mostly developing upstream supply industries which could avoid the market weakness of insufficient human resources .  
Some calculating employees could tell that my husband was n't completely in support of me . To my surprise , they conspired to make my standing worse . Sometimes in public with a lot of people around , my husband scolded me , and after he left the room the employees treated my with a cold , haughty air .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
The reception room has long been the part of the Presidential Palace that has received the greatest public exposure . Two years ago , the simple old carpet and armchairs from the frugal days of national reconstruction were replaced . Now the walls and furniture are all coordinated in a gentle cream color , and the carpet is decorated with Chinese motifs .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
In the view of Huang Chun-ming , an associate professor of architecture at Chung Yuan Christian University , they did this because they got sick of the wasted time and effort of tearing holes through the walls every time they laid a new road . They figured they might as well just tear down the whole thing , using the salvaged stone as a material for the public structures they were building .  
For example , the public is allowed to walk through the Po Ai district , but mindful of being watched , everyone 's mood naturally grows more solemn upon entering it . People talk in hushed tones and do n't linger - - let alone line up and make a lot of noise ( the only exception being the music corps responsible for handling the daily flag raising and lowering ceremonies ) .  
Choose any public structure in the Po Ai Special District ( the high-security area which includes the offices of top government officials ) and you may be surprised to discover that this structure has , at one and the same time , pillars and gables in the traditional Italian style , an exaggerated French Mansard style roof , and red brick walls made with decorative white stripes typical of Britain 's Victorian era .  
In the history of Chinese cities , fire-fighting measures were most thorough during the Song dynasty . Song cities resembled those of today 's Taiwan , with residences and places of business mixed together , streets less than fifty paces wide with alleys branching off them , buildings that rubbed up against each other , and great diversity within the population . With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
But in previous years when public health insurance was principally administered under labor insurance , limitations in terms of equipment , manpower , and even information about the total number of monthly registered cases in all the clinics and hospitals , made it completely unattainable . Computerized statistical analysis and cross-referencing of the vast amounts of information was even farther outside the realm of possibility .  
At the beginning of December 1992 , they organized the first public hearing over the Meinung reservoir . At the same time , in order to build consensus among local citizens , they took to driving a rickety old farm vehicle without a license plate , with signs on the front and rear painted by artist Tseng Wen-chung which said in large letters , " For farm use " and " Seventh Section Work Station . "  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
Nevertheless , according to Chang Le-chi 's description , NGOs always want to keep their image of " being afraid of becoming politically sullied . " They stand somewhat aloof from authorities . They even purposefully maintain a safe distance from political figures with similar ideas , and they forbid currently unployed essential staff from running for public office , to prevent opportunists from turning social activism into a springboard for amassing personal political resources . "  
NGOs to date have no effective channels to participate in the countless detailed activities of public administration that are underway on a daily basis . Nevertheless , NGO personnel may indeed be recruited by specialized consultative committees to help formulate policy for major issues .  
The government 's broad assimilation of non-governmental personnel theoretically should be a happy turn of events . But because the foundation of mutual trust on both sides is indeed quite fragile , those who are brought into the public sector are inevitably interpreted by their former colleagues as " lukewarm and easily lured to the other side . " Those still waving the banner and cheering for the non-governmental camp are often labeled by governmental officials as " talking tough in order to get what they want . "  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
" Moon Children " was originally selected as material for a show to be aired over public television . But this " magnum opus " of more than 70 episodes laboriously filmed over two years was held up by administrative procedures at public television , which wanted to air it reduced to 44 minutes , in two segments .  
The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life . " At the same time , because schools offered no classes in appreciation of modern poetry , the general public still needed some guidance before it could really accept this work .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
Therefore , over the last ten years , the three Peking opera troupes went on fewer and fewer military entertainment missions . The main mission of the troupes became entertaining at veteran 's homes , participating in the annual national drama competition and performing for the public .  
Commerce , like sports , is about competition . Still , it was completely unexpected that one of the losers in the public tender , ERA , would get together with the Sampo Giants ( an " amateur " team that has long sought in vain to be allowed to join the CPBL ) to organize their own professional baseball grouping . Called " Taiwan Major League Professional Baseball " ( the TML ) , it looks like it will be the second pro circuit .  
However , Tien Shih-lin , a winner of the Spoken Arts Heritage Award maintains , " The history and humor of modern comic dialogues are not necessarily linked in a direct line with that of ancient theater , because it is exclusively an art form developed among the people from the humorous jargon of public squares or tea houses . "  
Later on , the Puli Township public works bureau took the initiative to recruit scholars and relevant administrative agencies , holding the Puli High School Tamalin Ruins Investigative Conference , at which they decided a full-scale excavation ought to take place at the original test dig site . Up through the middle of April , the archaeological dig kept going .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
In early December of last year , the Public Television Broadcasting Law was first placed on the Legislative Yuan 's agenda , and the legislators started discussing its every provision . Those legislators who support the law say that the TV programs we currently have are hardly up to snuff . The ones to be blamed for Taiwan 's questionable quality of culture are commercial TV stations . In order not to let Taiwan 's programming be devoured by alien pop culture , we need a public television station to produce high-quality shows .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
Its functions were similar to that of a small-scale city government . Besides managing the affairs of businessmen , it also handled the affairs of a municipal government , such as ferry services , night watchman duties and relief for the poor during the winter months . In the past , the imperial government did almost nothing at all . They only handled taking taxes and spanking the common people 's bottoms ( keeping public order ) , so business organizations joined together to manage city government on their own .  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
A large quantity of related products have one after the other become hot items in the marketplace . More than a few products which have nothing to do with the subject have been decorated with irrelevant " EQs . " Experts and famous public figures have been frequently invited to discuss the merits of EQ on TV and radio , and to speak at meetings and activities , exhibiting " feats of EQ . " As a matter of course , the " EQ fad " has swept into the realm of children 's education .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
In Lung 's view , the importance the Hong Kong Government attached to public buildings at that time was indicative of Hong Kong 's rapid advance in the 20th century " It was no longer a barren place which cost more than it earned , as it had been seen by Queen Victoria , and still less the insignificant speck of land it had been in the mind of the Empress Dowager Cixi , " he writes .  
Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
But the EEA has turned these disputes into public matters , and now a firm catching a competitor taking its trade secrets can file a complaint with the FBI , which can use the federal government 's resources to pursue the investigation . The FBI can also legally set up " stings " to raise the conviction rate in trade secret cases . It is tantamount to encouraging American firms to strike out foreign rivals that are threatening them .  
The unlicensed " underground radio stations " stirred up criticism about public affairs , providing a release for dissatisfaction about society and government . As new radio stations have appeared , they have gone to sensational lengths to attract listeners . On the air , young show hosts talk about sexual topics : incest , gigolos , oral sex .  
Furthermore , public electricity service in Nicaragua was unreliable , and brown-outs were common . The electric generator which the hotel used had insufficient wattage , so embarrassing episodes of guests with heads full of soap suds wrapped in bath robes screaming complaints were all too common .  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Legislators or members of the public raised questions touching on issues of education , ideology , national security , and so on . Actually , concern should mainly be focused on the substantial provisions for implementation . The Executive Yuan has assigned the MAC and the MOE to study possible relevant follow-up rules and methods . The principle of recognizing mainland degrees has not changed , and the position of the MAC on this question has never changed .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Lee suggests that Lin will promote educational reform in a steady , careful manner . Although Lin Ching-jiang is under the heat of intense public scrutiny , he displays considerable self-confidence . He has declared that educational reform is not about swashbuckling heroism , but about long-term commitment . He intends to implement smaller class sizes by the year 2006 , and emphasizes that the Ministry of Education will place high priority on adult education .  
The ROC government had been established on Taiwan for 20 years and the fruits of land reform had provided a basis for the greater prosperity of the common people . Economic activity , primarily from public investment , was flourishing . However , the island was still under martial law , political prohibitions such as those outlawing the establishment of political parties had not yet been repealed , and the social atmosphere was tense .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
The brutal murder of an ordinary postgraduate student at a prestigious university , in a research institute building with access restricted by the use of a magnetic card reader , shocked the public and aroused the special concern of the police .  
A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
He also is " allergic " to abstract modern art . He feels that these artists merely want to express their individuality by doing something strange and different , but without putting in any real effort in terms of content or technique , so that they can not find resonance with the broad public .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
The former is a passive network . It is activated when a doctor anywhere in Taiwan comes across any disease which , according to law , must be reported ; the doctor then files a report with the local bureau of public health . The latter network involves cooperation among public health agencies and about 800 doctors nationwide . Each week a telephone survey is done of the situation in various areas , so that there is constant active monitoring of overall public health conditions .  
In the recent enterovirus case , public health scholars were certain that the main channel of transmission of the disease was through fecal and oral transmission . It was rarely transmitted through the air . Thus they instructed people to avoid public places , and to thoroughly wash their hands . Also , swimming pools , kindergartens , nursery schools , and other likely locations for the spread of illness were closed .  
Its factory districts are neat and clean ; the factories themselves are sealed and lack both smokestacks belching black smoke and the never-ending streams of trucks typical of traditional industry . " [ The public ] knows nothing about the firms and has no dealings with them , " says Chung Shu-chi , a Hsinchu native who is both a delegate to the National Assembly and one of the founders of the Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Association .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
Moreover , it takes system safety very seriously and will build in passwords to prevent theft of the data . The National Card project is ready to fly , but despite repeated assurances from the RDEC and the fact that it will only combine two functions in its initial stage , the public 's opposition remains strong . Government agencies must still give careful consideration to the functions that the card will later include and the potential problems that may result .  
A few years ago , male writer Ku Ling , speaking at a public forum , advised married Taiwanese men to beware of " public menaces . " He was referring to well-educated , independent , and ambitious women who were unwilling to settle down .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Consequently , private museums established after this law came into effect have been treated precisely the same as large public museums in terms of facilities and organizational requirements : minimum structural support capacities , obstruction-free spaces , or such public safety issues as fire safety are all scrutinized against the standards governing large museums .  
" In Taiwan , AIDS is a venereal disease , " says Troy Lee . In the past , LOFAA 's primary mission was caring for AIDS victims . However , the group gradually realized that the key to AIDS prevention is education of those members of the public who are not infected with the virus . " If even sex is difficult to talk about , how can we talk about AIDS ? "  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
Hayashi Eidai says , of the Volunteers : " Do n't be distracted by their seemingly pro-Japanese public appearance , sometimes dressed in Japanese uniforms , with Japanese caps , and singing Japanese army songs . As soon as they had a drink it was not at all unknown for them to start cursing the Japanese for being heartless and immoral , and damning Japanese imperialism . " Clearly , the Volunteers carry heavy psychological baggage from the war .  
Taiwan is blessed with a number of lavishly gifted film-makers who are committed to their ideals , but the solemnity of whose creations perhaps deters a movie-going public raised on Hollywood and Disney . Their films , however , help serious cinema-goers in Taiwan and around the world to better confront life , and at the same time win international exposure for Taiwan , enabling the island 's more cultured aspect to break through in the face of international political taboos and wrangling .  
Whether for reasons of courtesy or safety , the idea that there are times when a mobile phone should be turned off is not very widespread in Taiwan . Given the difficulty of forcing people to turn off their phones , the MOTC will soon begin accepting applications from the private sector to install mobile-phone signal disrupters . This will stop the phones from functioning in areas where their use is restricted , thus resolving the problem of their use in public venues . Other controversies still exist .  
And when Taichung police cracked down on illegal drinking establishments , one station focused entirely on the response of the bars ' " public relations girls , " running a six-minute report in which the camera spent most of its time aimed at the girls ' thighs and skimpy tops .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
Amidst the hasty passage of the amendments , a provision allowing private gambling , long supported by a certain group of legislators , was attached to and passed along with the regulations . This rider reads : " For the purposes of staging internationally recognized events , application may be made to the competent authority for approval of special issuance of public welfare lottery tickets . "  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
And while she did grapple with the idea prior to going ahead with the shooting , the spread 's publication elicited a nearly universally positive response , enabling Yu Ke-hsin to cast off the public image as " megastar Andy Lau 's former girlfriend " that had dogged her for so long .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
The Executive Yuan news website , established by the Government Information Office ( GIO ) , was formally launched in August . This new website , designed as a part of the drive for " electronic , Internet-wired government , " is the Executive Yuan 's own dedicated news operation , providing audio-visual real-time news , along with information on policies and measures of the Executive Yuan . The site also takes advantage of the Net 's rapid interactive capability to give the public a direct channel of communication with the Executive Yuan .  
Lin Yi-shih has gone from scouring temple courtyards and other public gathering places for worthy competitors to participating in international competitions . Steven Chen , once playing out endgames from a night market hawker 's stand , now provides an Internet site where the best players can meet . The lives of these two chess masters have certainly changed dramatically . But that is only appropriate , since Chinese chess has itself had quite a varied and colorful life history .  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
The Philippine negation of the sovereignty of the Republic of China on Taiwan offended the ROC 's national honor and caused a public outcry here . In the following two months , the Philippines unilaterally cut Taiwan 's weekly passenger quota to 3,000 and sent notice that it would terminate the aviation accord as of October 1 . With dialogue breaking down , Taiwan finally announced the suspension of air links on October 1 . It stated that negotiations for a new aviation agreement could only begin after the old accord had been recognized and respected .  
On the flip side of the coin , the extensive and rapid development of golf courses has brought with it a sizable environmental impact , and reports of destruction of fragile hilly land areas , water consumption , pesticide use , and occupation of state land stream through the media in a constant flow . Exposure of such issues finally came to a head in the late 1980s , when environmentalists began the " movement against golf course development , " which elicited general sympathy among the public .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
And he appointed Tang Fei , a member of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and a four-star general , to become premier . As a result , Chen 's standing with the public has shot upward . A Gallup poll showed that 81% of respondents were satisfied with Chen 's performance thus far , and had great hope for the future .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
In December 1978 the US government officially announced its intention to sever relations with the ROC on January 1 1979 , and the KMT canceled the election . The public 's fear , anger , and longing for democracy fueled intense discontent . On December 10 , 1979 , Formosa magazine marked International Human Rights Day by organizing a big protest march in Kaohsiung , and the event unraveled into the infamous Kaohsiung Incident . Lu was one of the key speakers at the protest , calling on the people to fight for their rights .  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top-notch talents amid the fierce international competition .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
And now the tragedy at Pachang Creek , when millions of viewers saw four people swept to their deaths on live TV . Once again , the public is left feeling hurt and angry . And the question is raised : Are incompetence and inefficiency endemic within the structure of our bureaucracy ?  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
" In the township of Puli , for example , every single public structure collapsed , including the town hall , the police station , and the schools . That 's hard to believe . Public structures house the very agencies that are supposed to work for our safety . They should be the last buildings to fall , not the first , " says Wang , who adds that the government was only worried about tearing down and clearing away destroyed buildings after the quake , very possibly destroying evidence of fraudulent construction practices in the process .  
The public is very wary of the nuclear plant , however , and environmental groups have been engaged in a raging debate with plant supporters over industrial policy and nuclear safety . There have been numerous street demonstration against the plant , and many members of the Democratic Progressive Party , including former DPP chairman Lin Yi-hsiung , are among the plant 's leading detractors . Opposition to the plant is one of the DPP 's key policy positions .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
Pearl Tan , public relations manager at Applied Materials Taiwan , a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : DRAM , the hottest industry in Taiwan , which was a monopoly of the US firm Texas Instruments . Tan notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in the US , patent royalties must still be paid to Texas Instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced around the world annually .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Niu Gur began drawing " Uncle Niu the Guerilla Fighter " in 1951 . Finding humor amidst the tragic longing for home of the many mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 and could not go back , the strip struck a deep chord with the public , and sparked a tremendous response . Subscriptions to the Central Daily News shot upward from a few thousand per month to tens of thousands , and Uncle Niu became a major figure in cultural circles .  
Last year during the transition of power to a new administration , Lai 's financial expertise and ability to coordinate across issue areas did not go unnoticed . After taking the post of vice premier , he immediately proposed a number of policies of fundamental importance , including putting the financial system in order , helping traditional industries , upgrading infrastructure , promoting job creation , and inviting public participation . These outline the hopes of the new government for economic and financial development .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Little League baseball remains an inte-gral link in the memories all Taiwanese have of growing up . Professional baseball was also immensely popular for a time . However , in recent years , following regrettable incidents involving gambling and manipulation of players by local organized crime syndicates , baseball withered in the public 's fancy .  
His most fervent hope is that political leaders and the 600,000-strong army of public servants will " jointly build a culture of public service encompassing the nation 's legal system , institutions , and education system , in which public servants are conscientious , impartial , incorruptible and insightful , the talented are given their due , and those in the lower ranks have reason to be satisfied with their jobs . "  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
Since 1991 more than 100 new public and private high schools ( including comprehensive high schools ) have been founded , so now there are more than 270 such institutions . Meanwhile , the ratio of students entering academic vs . vocational tracks has been adjusted to 45:55 . This means that today more than 40% of kids can keep their university dream alive after junior high school .  
The devastating earthquake two years ago-the biggest in 100 years-caused 70 of the village 's 156 residences to collapse , not to mention the 30-plus houses that were left partially crippled by the disaster . While fortunately only one individual received minor injuries , none of the public buildings , including Tannan Elementary , the police station , and the village 's Catholic church , were left unscathed-in fact , most were totally destroyed . Moreover , access to the outside world was completely severed for a week .  
" For a decade or two now , researchers in other countries have been taking notice of the boost that global warming can give to disease vectors , " says Professor Wang Chiu-sen of the graduate institute of public health at National Taiwan University . The list of diseases that may be helped to spread by climate warming includes viral diseases like dengue fever , yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , bacterial diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and parasitic diseases like filariasis and schistosomiasis .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
Cheng 's songs became popular in spite of not having been commercially distributed , demonstrating the resiliency that Taiwanese music has gained by being rooted in the hearts of the people . Although the major record labels are facing tough times and releasing fewer albums , many artists are still getting their work to the public through independent labels .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
Examination Yuan vice president nominee Chang stated that if endorsed she would assist in civil service system reform by advocating professional and effective management of government agencies . In the future , public officials would need to be certified , and those that failed to meet the new criteria would be phased out .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
The magazine 's reporting was based on the underlying premise that " sex is scandalous , " and the Hsu sisters ' agent put on a vigorous " damage control " campaign and assured the public that the sisters never took Ecstasy or had sex . The two sides engaged in a furious round of accusations and denials , but one thing they did agree on was that sex is a dirty word . It was all oddly out of character for a couple of girls whose stock-in-trade was their image of being rebellious and outlandish .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
The public has been largely supportive of the new policy , but it has been noted that there are also big problems with the paper products now being used as an alternative by many retail establishments . To cut costs , 90% of all makers of paper food containers in Taiwan print on the products with substandard ink . To spruce up their products and make them more resistant to wear and tear , many buyers ask paper-goods makers to coat their products with a thin plastic film , which makes the product unrecyclable .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
In consideration of this , on March 3rd the Executive Yuan convened an inter-departmental meeting on " Promoting and Maintaining Tourism and Traveler Safety . " The purpose was to require all publicly operated scenic recreational areas to implement comprehensive inspections and to upgrade safety standards to international levels . This would include reinforcing inspection systems , adopting inspection certificates , establishing inspection teams to conduct periodic random inspections , and strengthening public accident insurance , all to prevent future tragedies from occurring .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
The public was encouraged during the Ming dynasty to practice martial arts , and people were intensely competitive about it . Ming dynasty metal workers were the first in the world to use coke and piston bellows in swordmaking , and they developed a number of advanced steelmaking techniques that led to the production of outstanding sabers and swords .  
Wang Dan 's identity gives his creative writing a free pass to the public , and even more to the mainstream media . But at the same time this also is a problem for him . It makes it unnecessary for him to pursue perfection in his literary life , and his obscure and emotional essay style readily reveals a literary technique that is not yet mature , and indeed a character that is equally childlike .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
In response to these claims , on July 10 the e-paper of President Chen Shui-bian stated that Taiwan has always had a low-tuition policy , with the best schools often being the least expensive . To help narrow the gap between tuition at heavily subsidized public universities as opposed to tuition-dependent private ones , the government subsidizes up to 20% of routine expenses at private universities , which is very rarely done anywhere else in the world .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
The odd thing is that precisely because Taiwan 's public health system was so successful in the past-because the " enemy " had been defeated in every battle-people became inattentive to public health . As time went on , frontline public health personnel neglected their training and lost completely their fighting edge .  
In markets that are jointly monopolized , large financial consortiums move fast , attracting the general public in order to make a killing . Then these companies pursue various philanthropic activities to show their compassionate side , by making public displays of charitable donations to the people of Lanyu ( even if the people there have no need of their gifts ) or funding protection of sea turtles on Lanyu ( even if the extra funds actually result in more harm to the turtles ) .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Unlike Hsinchu 's experimental primary and middle schools , which are under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Yuan 's National Science Council , STSIP 's public primary and middle schools are covered by the Tainan County Bureau of Education , and are ranked at the same level as all public primaries , enjoying no special privileges .  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .  
In recent years a number of stunning , large public works of art have cropped up in Taipei . Among them are Flying in the Eastern District at the intersection of Tunhua North Road and Minsheng East Road , and Desire in Flight , a piece in the new Panchiao station depicting a bird spreading its wings , soaring , and alighting . Their bright red colors and concise , elegant lines add warmth to a bustling intersection and train station .  
" Before I was 50 , I dedicated myself to public service , but today I am living for myself , " says Yeh Chin-chuan . No longer burdened with public office , Yeh is manifestly free and unrestrained . He has fulfilled a number of dreams he has had for many years , including climbing a mountain in Kyrgyzstan , competing in the Ironman Triathlon , swimming across Sun Moon Lake , and taking part in the Taroko marathon .  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums . The possibility that during the March presidential election next year referendums will be simultaneously held on entry into the World Health Organization , the fourth nuclear power station , and the reform of the National Assembly is also drawing close attention from observers .  
In the first place , they maintain , people are driven by their own individual interests and are frequently unable to take the broad view in considering public affairs . This " me first " attitude exacerbates conflicts of interest . Secondly , to avoid referendum issues being controlled by special-interest groups , laws must be passed to regulate public announcements , provide for the balanced presentation of information and guarantee the free flow of information .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
Will the evolution of food serve as a metaphor for the whole relationship ? Recently all the major political parties in Taiwan have been at war over the issue of public referenda , amidst dark hints from the United States and overt threats from the PRC . One can not help but sigh . When we were small , " recovering the mainland " was the unquestionable mission of the nation , and " pacifism " was a betrayal of the country and an evasion of moral responsibility .  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .  
In keeping with this view , many scholars have seen the culture industry as a system by which a small number of cultural middlemen who know how to manipulate public tastes feed consumers with a standardized , mass-produced " canned culture " that is artificial and bogus , neither the product of cultural workers ' autonomous creativity , nor capable of representing consumers ' inner yearnings .  
It is expected that interactive services will change the public 's passive TV viewing habits , shifting them toward active choice and control over viewing times . They are also likely to allow audiences to pay for programming according to what they wish to watch . However , the key to success is that the content delivered must be varied and extensive .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
Many members of the public receive threatening phone calls informing them they have offended a gangster , and if not careful will get their limbs broken . The caller will claim to have the victim 's photograph and address , and may even have a pizza delivered to the victim 's home , to strike fear into them . Some victims are forced to keep a nervous watch whenever they leave their homes , while others even opt to move to a new home .  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless . By contrast , at present only around 40-50 larger sets of photovoltaic panels are installed in Taiwan to generate electricity from the sun 's rays . On public land and buildings , to date the MOEA has completed demonstration systems in only a few locations including the Presidential Palace and the Yushan meteorological observatory . There is also little sign of enthusiasm for installations on ordinary residential buildings .  
He cited examples such as Vienna , where a referendum was held to stop a downtown university from cutting down six trees , and Hawaii , the first place in the US to legislate to protect its urban foliage by passing a law that required permission to cut or move any tree over eight feet tall , whether in a private garden or a public park .  
Speaking of sports marketing , retired NBA star Michael Jordan recently ruffled feathers in Taiwan in a whirlwind stopover , ducking out of sight after a quick 90-second appearance before fans who had waited three hours to see him . High-flying Taiwan Nike eventually had to make a public apology for the fiasco . The company had thought to score a marketing coup on the strength of Jordan 's huge appeal , but the incident only proved that fans can put you on a pedestal , and fans can pull you back off it .  
National Chengchi University associate professor of sociology Kuan Ping-yin dissects the problem : " The middle classes enjoy a relatively high social standing . To them , anger management is an intrinsic part of their work . The ability to control your temper is a prerequisite to working environments that require frequent interaction with others , such as the service industry and public relations . "  
The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
Post-secondary education is the best way to break down barriers between social groups and achieve social equity . Taiwan , however , is faced with a problem : her relatively inexpensive public schools have only enough slots to accept approximately 30% of her high school graduates , but most children of salaried and manual workers and of lower - and middle-income families go on to study at the more expensive private schools which tend to have fewer resources , and offer lower quality educations .  
With regard to the shocking nature of both the Body Worlds exhibit and the abortion film , all of the above scholars agree that without accompanying documents , lectures , explanations or discussions to allay audience anxieties , simply relying on what is visually apparent will not suffice to reveal the true meaning of life education . Instead , such events may lead to further confusion of public values and errors in understanding . This is where their real concern lies .  
According to the godfather of Taiwan 's community colleges , Huang Wu-hsiung , society-based courses ' goal of guiding and shaping their students relies on four things-participation in social activities , confronting the issues facing society , developing a concern for the community , and helping students advance through concrete examples of the ideas and theories taught . Thus the biggest challenge facing community colleges is finding how to bring in people out of the workaday rat race and from sectors of the public who have never really given any concern to civic affairs .  
Now , that land is more than just a " natural classroom " for the 11 classes on ecology , flora , and fauna at the college ; it 's also been opened to the public , becoming a well known place for the people of Yungho and Chungho-particularly local elementary and junior high school kids-to come and get in touch with nature . The college also trains volunteer guides for the garden to meet the huge demand from the local community to visit it .  
As well as holding seminars and other such activities , the Educational Issues group also seeks to ' correct twisted educational values , ' " hoping to bring together the voices of concerned parents . After having held a public forum on this and come up with no obvious answers , they moved on to try tapping parent-teacher associations and study groups in an effort to establish a network and stake out a position in the community . Calling in the experts  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
Lee Yuh-hwa , Eslite 's assistant manager of public relations , has been with Eslite for many years and seen its growth at first hand . She says that entering an Eslite has always been a humbling experience , like walking into a quiet and magical place . Eslite patrons are well aware that there is nothing flashy about the company 's employees .  
In former times , the emperor had the final say in how urban spaces were organized , and all buildings took the imperial palace as their yardstick . In the democratic era , citizens have formed a close relationship with public spaces , giving them a key role . Public spaces afford people the most immediate aesthetic awareness of their environment . "  
The man responsible for this is Liang Kuo-kuo , head of the Planning Department of the Taipei City Traffic Bureau 's Traffic Engineering Office . Hsinyi District is fairly big , says Liang , and the cycle lanes head along the " green belt " planned for each side of the district . The lanes pass along Sungkao Rd . , Sungchi Rd . , Sungjen Rd . and Sungteh Rd . , covering a total of 10.5 kilometers , and allow the public to ride along a shaded area and enjoy a bit of fresh air .  
Looking to the future , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that NHI premiums will have to increase to ensure that hospitals can survive , the public can get needed medical care , and the NHI program itself can stay solvent . The caveat is that besides increasing revenues , restraining expenditures and eliminating waste are the only viable long-term options for saving the program , and the only means of achieving a satisfactory result for the government , the health care sector , and the public .  
In order to change this situation , Guangzhou , under the guideline of " sports-based comprehensive development , " adjusted the structural composition and functional orientation of the newly-constructed and remodeled public sports facilities prior to the 9th National Sports Meet in an effort to achieve a multi-purpose integration of athletic , cultural , recreational and entertainment functions for these sports facilities .

During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
The raising of awareness about indigenous peoples must be seen not as the task of a Year but as part of the ongoing and permanent process of education and public information about human rights and the urgent need to protect and strengthen cultural diversity .  
The Governments concerned should therefore set goals for the reversal of that tendency by educating the public to accept cultural , ethnic and religious diversity with a view to promoting communal harmony and understanding .  
Account should be taken of such problems as extreme poverty , limited resources , dependence on primary commodities , proportional public debt , lack of basic infrastructures and insufficient administrative capacity .

At that meeting it was also said that better quality of life for all was the objective of sustainable development , the foundations of which are democracy , human rights , transparent and responsible management of public affairs , investment in the human individual and protection of the environment .

However , the nuclear testing undertaken right afterwards caused disillusion in international public opinion and has made it imperative for all nations first and foremost the nuclear-weapon States to redouble their efforts in a fully responsible manner , so as to complete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course of the next year .

That revision offered us substantive additional support for the implementation of activities planned within the framework of the national development strategy , in particular effective activities related to the structural adjustment programme , the public sector reform programme and the regional integration programme .  
We are , however , alert to the dangers associated with that sector and , while pursuing the benefits to be derived from such institutions , we must be ever on guard for white-collar criminals who , as part of their everyday activity , launder their ill-gotten gains through the international financial systems , using both public - and private-sector capital projects for this purpose .

The main topics were intolerance in all its aspects , such as racism , xenophobia , anti-semitism , religious fundamentalism and aggressive nationalism ; the role of civic society ; the impact of public opinion ; the importance of early warning ; and actions at the national and international levels .  
A painful and futile internal conflict , brought on by intransigence and ideological utopianism , added to the waste of public resources and Governments overwhelmed by the nation 's problems , led Peru into a deep internal crisis with grave international consequences . 
At the same time , the legal regime develops apace , as experts learn simultaneously to apply multiple sets of norms from such diverse areas as commercial law , civil law , environmental law , international economic law , the law of the sea , public and private international law and mining law .  
My delegation would like to express its conviction that the establishment of such a forum or of other independent national or international bodies , whether public or private , should be made proof against egoistic interests , cliquishness , and the belief that success and efficiency can be the exclusive possession of any party .  
Through these actions it aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 50 / 291 and the special meeting of the First Committee as well as other events traditionally held in observance of Disarmament Week have once again proven that the international community continues to rely on Disarmament Week as an appropriate occasion for further promoting national and international activities to educate and inform the public about major disarmament issues and developments .  
In the preambular paragraphs , the General Assembly would note with satisfaction that the programme has trained an appreciable number of public officials selected from all geographical regions represented in the United Nations system and also that many officials of developing countries have acquired expertise through the training programme .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
The international community therefore has a special responsibility to check and curb these illicit arms transfers as a matter of the highest priority , as terrorism has emerged as the principal public enemy , often transcending national boundaries and threatening to tear apart the very fabric of civil society . 
By this I mean , for example , earmarking for the armed forces imposts on exports of raw materials such as oil or preferential treatment for businesses controlled or owned by the armed forces , which may also be stockholders in major public and private companies .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .  
Developing local strategies for improving the quality of life and the environment , integrating decisions on land use and land management , investing in the public and private sectors and mobilizing human and material resources , thereby promoting employment generation that is environmentally sound and protective of human health .  
Institutionalize a participatory approach to sustainable urban development , based on a continuous dialogue between the actors involved in urban development ( the public sector , private sector and communities ) , especially women and indigenous people ;  
Governments , with the participation of the private sector , non-governmental organizations , local community groups , indigenous people , women , local government units and the public at large , should act to maintain and expand the existing vegetative cover wherever ecologically , socially and economically feasible , through technical cooperation and other forms of support .  
To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
Such regional cooperative mechanisms could be facilitated through public / private partnerships and provide support to Governments , industry , non-governmental educational institutions and other domestic and international organizations , and by strengthening global professional networks ;  
Responding to a question on national machinery for the coordination of policies dealing with women and on its responsibilities , status and authority , the representative , referring to the fourth periodic report , informed members of the Committee that such machinery , with mandates for women , the family and children , had been established within federal , regional and local governments and that it cooperated with public organizations .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
Her Office 's assessment of the situation was that it was easier to work to have rape classified as a public crime than to try to reverse the burden of proof requirement , which involved going against the entrenched judicial , religious , social and cultural prejudices which came into play whenever such a debate arose in Bolivia .  
In the light of overwhelming Croatian public support and the support of almost all of the parliamentary parties regarding the termination of the UNPROFOR mandate , the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia reiterates that negotiations , as well as the implementation of all basic provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions , i.e . a peaceful reintegration of occupied territories , remain a permanent Croatian policy objective and orientation .  
The representative replied that the third periodic report , which noted the Ombudsman 's request for a more effective affirmative action policy , explained that the view of the Gender Equality Ombudsman was that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened to gain proper effect , or abolished altogether , as in her opinion the existing arrangements served to give the public unrealistic notions of women 's opportunities in the labour market . 
Promote changes in attitudes , structures , policies , laws and practices in order to eliminate all obstacles to human dignity , equality and equity in the family and society ; and promote full and equal participation of urban and rural women , and women with disabilities , in social , economic and political life , including in the formulation , implementation and follow-up of public policies and programmes ;  
Develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
Improving the reliability , validity , utility and public availability of statistical and other information on social development and gender issues , including the effective use of gender disaggregated statistics collected at the national , regional and international levels , including through support to academic and research institutions .  
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health , by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally , and the re-emergence of major diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular , cholera ;  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary contributions and individual voluntary contributions , for social development .  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Urges the multilateral financial institutions , recipient countries and donor countries , within the conceptual framework and design and implementation of structural adjustment policies in Africa , to pay special attention to eradicating poverty and addressing the social impact of these policies , while focusing on public investment , fiscal reform , reform of public enterprises , export expansion and efficient public administration ;  
Promoting effective enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and access to existing social protection and public services by , in particular , through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of all relevant human rights instruments ;  
The environmental problems have been aggravated by agricultural policies - which have encouraged increasing production of some commodities on fragile lands and the use of inappropriate farm practices - and the lack of markets to value environmental public goods or the failures of some markets to internalize environmental costs and benefits within farmers ' decision-making .  
This implies the need for the development of creative partnerships among nations and between the public and private sectors , by means of which nations and institutions can establish collaborative ventures for technology transfer ; technology can then be acquired and adapted through conventional programmes , such as training , information exchange and access to patent information .  
Today these plantations and the remaining more or less natural forests suffer from lack of silvicultural interventions , overmaturation and inadequate control of excessive wildlife populations ( which , in addition to being a generally uneconomical activity , is not appreciated by the general public ) , and new environmental conditions such as air pollution and the threat posed by climate changes .  
In general , it was noted that the main factors constraining the development of sustainable national capacities include ( a ) the absence of an enabling public sector environment ; ( b ) the lack of a critical mass of suitably trained and motivated counterparts ; ( c ) high turnover ; and ( d ) the non-fulfilment of national budgetary and in-kind commitments .  
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
With reference to the Ombud 's call for a more effective affirmative action policy , she said that the view of the previous gender equality Ombud , as presented in Norway 's third periodic report , had been that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened , in order to make them fully effective , or abolished altogether , since existing arrangements gave the general public a quite unrealistic idea of women 's chances in the labour market .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
Complete national law reviews by 2000 in order to incorporate the principles and provisions of accepted international norms and standards into national legislation and to revoke any remaining discriminatory laws ; ( d ) Provide gender sensitivity and women 's human rights training for all public officials , including law enforcement officers , legal and medical personnel , members of parliament and social workers , so that they may better exercise their public responsibilities ;  
Recognizing the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , including , inter alia , developing basic infrastructural facilities , promoting social development , combating socio-economic disparities and poverty , preparing , as appropriate , conditions for the private sector and protecting the environment ,  
Governments , non-governmental organizations and private-sector enterprises should take special measures to increase the proportion of women involved in economic decision-making , including studies on the incidence of women in such positions in the public and private sectors , the promotion of training programmes , analysis of alternative policies to provide women with careers leading to economic decision-making , and the adjustment of national legislation .  
The main institution officially entrusted with the maintenance of public security is the National Police , which , according to a December 1994 study carried out by a Multinational Commission on Public Security , 2 / is seriously lacking in human and material resources , and is involved chiefly in administrative and protection functions in urban areas .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
The vast majority of cases involving death have not been adequately investigated or resolved by the competent authorities , and this increases levels of impunity , promoting a widespread feeling of insecurity among the public , and makes it more difficult to distinguish violations of the right to life which could be classified as human rights violations from common crimes without a political motive .  
Such actions affecting private property or public utilities designed to meet the needs of the civilian population involve a high degree of risk for civilians and can not be justified as legitimate military operations .  
With regard to governance issues , national institutions and professionals from the public and private sectors , grass-roots organizations and political parties have been actively involved in discussions , round-table meetings and national conferences on governance issues , constitutional and legal reforms , etc . alongside high calibre international experts and consultants .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
The private sector needs to be actively encouraged to contribute to efforts to work towards sustainable development through the development and use of environmentally sound biotechnologies that balance social , environmental and economic objectives and the dissemination of reliable and accurate information to the public .  
Through various national , regional and global level expert consultations and conferences that involve the public and private sectors and non-governmental organizations , FAO has been increasing the awareness of the challenges and opportunities of modern biotechnologies at various levels .  
All designated depository libraries are expected to place the material received in the care of qualified library staff , to keep it in good order and to make it accessible to the public , free of charge , at reasonable hours .  
The UNEP corporate programme framework 1994-1995 stated that reliable flows of objective and meaningful information are critical to the mobilization of an environmentally aware and educated public and to the stimulation of effective decision-making .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Interest in the subject first arose as the general public became increasingly aware of the [ potentially ] harmful nature and effects of the fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests and as it became apparent that no region could avoid being affected by radioactive debris . 
Thus , the United States made public its view that nuclear testing was important for the security of the Western alliance , which depended on the maintenance of a reliable nuclear deterrence and that , consequently , it could consider a comprehensive test-ban treaty only as a " long-term objective " whose realization must be sought in the context of radical nuclear arms reductions , expanded confidence-building measures and , particularly , improved verification capabilities .  
It was stated that the issues of security should be considered with respect to a broad range of issues regarding negotiability .  In connection with its discussion of security issues , in particular the use of cryptography , the Working Group agreed that possible future work by UNCITRAL should not affect mandatory rules of national legislation adopted for public policy reasons in certain States to restrict the use of cryptography or the export of cryptography-related techniques .  
The exceptional cases of the alleged limitations of the human rights and freedoms of individual members of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija are the exclusive consequence of the endangering of the constitutional order of the country and the breach of public peace and order through decades-long aggressive activities of the separatist movement in this autonomous province .  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
It is estimated that an amount of $ 100,000 would be required for human rights education and public information in Guatemala to educate and keep the public civic organizations and the mass media , both national and international , informed of the Mission 's activities and findings .  
In view of the evolving mandate of the United Nations in the fields of economic and social development , peace-keeping and peacemaking , human rights and humanitarian assistance , the availability of print materials for public information is an increasingly crucial aspect of the promotion of an informed understanding and effective support for the work of the United Nations .  
As part of its primary responsibility for public information activities built around the World Public Information Campaign for Human Rights and the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in 1993 , the Department reprinted and distributed essential publications on human rights , including backgrounders on human rights and culture and on indigenous people .  
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
It used the occasion to inform the public of its objectives , and of the state of the implementation of the legislation in favour of disabled persons ; to organize sports competitions , tricycle race , soccer matches for physically disabled , athletic activities for deaf , and a cycling race for blind and visually impaired persons ; to organize cultural and economic activities .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal and more equitable access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
A representative of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) emphasized that violence against women was a major public health issue , since it led to psychological trauma , depression , substance abuse , injuries , sexually transmitted diseases , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , suicide and death ; however , the victims rarely received rehabilitative care , or the compensation received by the victims of other injury-causing trauma .  
One organization asserted that this recommendation was unfortunately silent on existing mechanisms for inter-agency meetings on public information issues covering high-priority agenda items such as social and economic development , crime prevention and criminal justice , human rights , environment and sustainable development , women and development , population and refugees .  
It aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
On average , women represent a mere 10 per cent of all elected legislators world wide and in most national and international administrative structures , both public and private , they remain underrepresented .  
Encourage the future development of peace research involving the participation of women to examine the impact of armed conflict on women and children , and the nature and contribution of women 's participation in national , regional and international peace movements ; engage in research and identify innovative mechanisms for containing violence and for conflict resolution for public dissemination , for use by women and men ; ( d ) bis Develop and disseminate research on the physical , psychological ,  
The Constitution of El Salvador , amended pursuant to the peace agreements , gives the President of the Republic the power to use the armed forces for the maintenance of domestic peace , tranquillity , order and public safety " in exceptional cases , where the normal means [ for that purpose ] have been exhausted " .  
It should be noted that although this measure is , in theory , based on the Constitution , the spirit of the peace agreements requires that it be subject to legal rules which establish expressly and restrictively the requirements and conditions which must be met before domestic peace , tranquillity , order or public safety can be considered to be endangered , in exceptional cases , and before the normal means for their preservation can be considered to have been exhausted .  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
To mitigate the heavy burdens of the poor , the Social Fund for Development ( SFD ) was established in 1991 as a temporary step to enhance structural adjustment programmes as well as to contribute to social well-being and protect vulnerable and low-income groups .  SFD executes six programmes , dealing with public works , community development , enterprise development , employment and retraining , institutional development and public transport .  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
Ten ad hoc expert group meetings . ( i ) Strategic management of the State and public budgets ; ( ii ) economic reform experiences in the countries of the region ; ( iii ) capacity for government ( 2 ) ; ( iv ) decentralization and local government ( 2 ) ; ( v ) regional development bodies ; ( vi ) management of regional development ; ( vii ) alternative approaches to the social evaluation of projects ; and ( viii ) project banks and investment planning . ( a ) Advisory services . 
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
The estimated requirements of $ 19,700 , reflecting negative growth of $ 31,500 , relate to the following expenditures : ( a ) public information production : reduced requirements of $ 10,600 would cover the cost of engaging external marketing research organizations and other related contractual services with a view to ensuring that the Department 's outputs are responsive to targeted audiences and their identified needs ; and ( b ) subscription to news agency services ( $ 9,100 ) . 
It is estimated that a provision of $ 865,700 , reflecting growth of $ 41,000 , would be required for the acquisition of professional radio and television reference books and materials , and public information supplies such as film , raw stock , audio and video tapes and cassettes , photographic film , paper and chemicals and other miscellaneous materials required for radio and visual productions and supplies for the operation of the typesetting system .  
The estimated requirement of $ 393,500 , at maintenance base level , would cover the cost of general temporary assistance for the replacement of staff on maternity leave and sick leave and for additional services during peak workload periods ( $ 373,800 ) ; and overtime and night differential for the retention of clerical and distribution staff and radio and visual technicians beyond normal working hours in order to provide public information material to the media .  
The major objective of the subprogramme is to meet the needs of Member States for information and policy-oriented analysis on selected issues related to private sector development and the enhancement of the efficiency and effectiveness of public enterprises through the promotion of market-oriented approaches , including the interactions between the international economic environment and national policy actions .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .  
UNDP assistance for the development of national capacity includes the reform of policies at the macro level thereby ensuring retention of qualified personnel , including fiscal polices , public administration law , civil service reform , including downsizing and the creation of professional incentives and more rational differentiation between salary scales .  
In the Seychelles , the national human resource development programme has as its objective increasing labour productivity through the creation of an enabling environment and incentives to the private sector and through reforms leading to greater capacity and increased efficiency in the public sector .  
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
Viewing the public service as a critical agent of change , the Programme aims to rebuild a public service that is the servant of the people : accessible , accountable , efficient , free of corruption , and providing excellent quality .  
The public service is defined as an institution that should be professional ; career-oriented ; non-partisan ; efficient , effective and responsive in terms of service delivery ; loyal in its service to the public and the elected Government of the day ; accountable to the public and Parliament .  
The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
In many developing countries there is an apparent lack of a " critical mass " of qualified managers , technicians , and skilled workers needed to support basic levels of public sector activity .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
Clearly , desirable levels of effective coordination do not result from the mere creation of joint departments : rather , they should arise from the regular , institutionalized work of combined units set up to monitor public socio-economic policies .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
Secondly , the Indian Administrative Service ( IAS ) has established a professional corps of educated public administrators who share a common background of professional training , accept a common set of responsibilities towards developing the capacities of the citizenry in their jurisdictions , and represent a strong presence of the national Government in state and local jurisdictions .  
The explanatory memorandum annexed to document A / 50 / 145 presumptuously claims that the examination by the United Nations of Taiwan 's " exceptional situation in the international context " " completely conforms with the principles and spirit of preventive diplomacy " .  This is an apparent attempt to confound black and white and mislead the public .  
This principle , first expressed in German law and in international law , is accepted as a general principle in all legal systems regarding public administration , but it is usually reflected in specific principles of more or less limited scope ;  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
According to Professor Ben Achour , French public law is a weapon for new nation-States in formation with its basic concepts of an autonomous administrative law reflecting the superiority of public interest and public service , whereas its liberal face inspired reformist and nationalist movements demanding the enforcement of revolutionary and republican principles .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
Nevertheless the path explored by the reformist Arab writers of the nineteenth century should be pursued and legal principles elaborated capable of bridging the gap between various communities and modern public administration , a step which is needed for participation in the world economy .  
As a result , the same activity can be performed in different countries by a public corporation or by the private sector ; it can be considered as a public utility or public service subject to extensive public regulation or , on the contrary , left to pure market economy , only subject ( for example ) to the law of competition and public order .  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
It has actively involved local , regional and national education authorities , teachers , parents , students , potential employers , non-governmental organizations and regional public and private institutions / organizations that can assist in the designing and testing of the new curriculum .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
By democratization , I mean a process by which an authoritarian society becomes increasingly participatory through such mechanisms as periodic elections to representative bodies , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
Because corrupt activities on the part of public officials can destroy the potential effectiveness of governmental programmes , hinder development and victimize individuals and groups , it is important that adequate criminal laws , including procedural legislation , be adopted to allow a recourse to sanctions and ensure an effective deterrence .  
In the initial period of 1994 , a conceptual approach was agreed upon , namely that the declaration should address the general public , utilize simple and not grandiose language , be substantive in nature , strive for brevity and reflect a thematic approach .  
The Preparatory Committee was advised that the Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its 1994 spring session held at Geneva , had further considered these issues , including , increasing system-wide participation in the fiftieth anniversary and consolidating the messages that the Organization would direct towards the general public during the critical year 1995 .  
The regulatory activities of the judges during the first half of 1994 , which for journalists were overly technical and which held little meaning among the general public , together with the preparatory work of the Deputy Prosecutor , which appeared dry work , were not initially helpful to the Tribunal when it came to overcoming the scepticism expressed throughout the first months of its existence .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .  
National measures for the Year have been successful in raising public awareness of family issues , including increased knowledge of the economic , social , demographic , cultural and other factors affecting families and their members .  
These included two introductory posters , published in 1990 and 1991 , and a major campaign poster in the six official languages , published in 1992 ; a press kit , three public television announcements and two documentary films on single-parent families and on the family and ageing , produced by the Department of Public Information ; a regularly updated calendar of events related to the Year ; stickers on the Year and the International Day of Families .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .  
The main topics of discussion will be determining which priority projects still needed to be executed and the means required for refocusing public interest and donor attention on Chernobyl , with special attention paid to ways of marking the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl on 26 April 1996 . 
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
Other steps included close cooperation to ensure that all the group 's financial sector operations were carried out in the context of a sound reform strategy ; explicit support by the group to privatization , through the provision of advisory services to Governments and the provision of finance for public enterprise restructuring and investments in privatized firms ; and the intensification of the group 's research on private sector issues .  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
In general , the United Nations system should be able to help Governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experiences and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
Implementation is primarily the responsibility of Governments , but is also dependent on a wide range of institutions in the public , private and non-governmental sectors at the community , national , subregional / regional and international levels . specifically devoted to women 's advancement globally . 
Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .  
On average , women represent a mere 10 per cent of all elected legislators world wide and in most national and international administrative structures , both public and private , they remain underrepresented .  
Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
Promote women 's economic independence , including employment , and eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women by addressing the structural causes of poverty through changes in economic structures , ensuring equal access for all women , including those in rural areas , as vital development agents , to productive resources , opportunities and public services ;  
The accumulation of theoretical knowledge has irreplaceable value for the purposes of educating younger generations and the public in general and for devising strategies and developing measures to counter the corrupting effects of organized crime on societal values .  
The decisive condition for their realization is the spontaneous initiative of individuals , first of all representatives of cultural and public life and of youth , with the financial assistance of national and international organizations and foundations .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
The most pressing task faced by the Department of Public Information is to ensure that the centrality of the United Nations in meeting the compelling challenges faced by the international community continues to be widely recognized by Governments and the world public at large , including in particular the influential non-official actors emerging on the world stage .  
The resolution encompasses dubious political objectives such as deceiving world public opinion in order to eliminate the growing pressure to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and lift the unjust embargo imposed on it in a bid to divert efforts to that end within the Security Council and thus ensuring the continued imposition of the embargo for as long as possible .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .

Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
The public was showing increasing concern regarding illicit trafficking ; it was noted that the press file prepared for the eighth session had doubled in size over the previous session , indicating that there had been a very great increase in public interest .

This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
The alleged perpetrators include clandestine organizations which , while claiming to be fighting against crime and impunity , have been responsible for threats of this kind , have thwarted investigations of crimes against human rights , caused the resignation of public prosecutors in high-profile cases and intimidated relatives and prospective new victims . 
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
The Programme of Action calls on Governments to increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially , inter alia , by formulating or strengthening , preferably by 1996 , and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels .

Federation was also dissatisfied with the part of the ICSC annual report dealing with the Geneva survey , which stated that staff representatives had threatened to make public any anomalous situations contained in the survey , thus breaching the confidentiality of the data provided by the participating employers .  
it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .

Robaina Gonz \ x { 5aee } ez ( Cuba ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Government of Cuba has requested the resumption of this session of the General Assembly in order to provide information regarding the events surrounding the repeated violation of our sovereignty by aircraft originating from United States territory , and also to give notice to the international community and to world public opinion that such violations are inadmissible and have dangerous implications for regional peace and security .  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
A stable legal framework , fair and efficient law enforcement and equal access to public services and justice , in accordance with international standards of human rights , are essential conditions for the creation of transparent and accountable institutions , for the promotion of a public administration that is responsive to the needs of the population and for the prevention of and fight against all forms of corruption .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
We are eager for greater efficiency and competitiveness in the public sector , for ongoing improvement in the provision of services , for excellence in public services , for the application of the most modern managerial techniques , for social marketing and for ethics in public service , which requires respect for such specific values as institutional loyalty and transparency of procedures .  
Regarding public finance , we strengthened the financial institutions for State financial programming and introduced new budgetary norms to secure investments in projects that are duly formulated and coordinated by our central planning body .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
The work of public administration should be guided by the principle that correct decisions should be taken , without unnecessary delay , and at the lowest possible administrative level as close as possible to the people whom the decisions will affect and that powers and accountability should go hand in hand .  
In this context , the major tool utilized by public administration in its work should not be decisions taken on an individual basis , but regulations intended to create mechanisms and frameworks within which independent activity can take place and social and economic entities can produce initiatives .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
In this context , the State seeks to modernize the kinds of measures taken by its public administration by gradually shifting its management and production actions towards a stronger public administration role in overseeing regulation and the proper functioning of economic mechanisms , in guaranteeing political and social stability and in protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society , in a spirit of social justice and rational solidarity .  
The imperatives of reducing budget deficits and the desire to achieve operational efficiency shared by us all could not possibly be the basis for a universal conclusion favouring the diminishment of the State or the systematic dismantling of public administration at the cost of inviting the disruption of networks that provide structure and sustenance to economic and social life in many developing countries .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
On the other hand , the Government was faced with crippling obstacles , in the form of a treasury that had been emptied and swept clean by the ousted regime ; the threat from regrouped elements of the defeated army of the former regime ; a completely decimated public service ; and interference by hostile foreign Governments associated with the defeated former regime .  
Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
These included the rethinking of existing organizational structures and the introduction of role delineation ; the revision of existing legislation and the introduction of new legislation to reflect subsidiarity ; the introduction of an information technology infrastructure ; sustained development initiatives in management of change and business re-engineering ; the setting up of local Government to enhance citizen empowerment ; the revamping of human resources practices and procedures ; the new salary structure , which reduced 96 pay scales to 20 ; and the introduction of a code of ethics for all public officers .  
In contrast with Europe , the absence of a middle class able to launch the process of economic and social development , the weakness of the industrial fabric , the well-known inadequacy of public facilities and national structure were , at the time of independence , major challenges to be met .  Hence the need for State intervention , including through protectionism , to modify the nature of comparative advantages .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
The reform altered 65 of the Constitution 's 202 articles , with respect to individual rights ; the rights and responsibilities of and guarantees for the Nicaraguan people ; political and social rights ; the rights of the Nicaraguan family ; defence and the national economy ; agrarian reform and public finances ; education and culture ; the organization of the State ; municipal affairs ; and the Atlantic Coast communities . 
Thus , seven preparatory studies have been undertaken in fields as diverse and important as the following : first , remuneration in the civil service ; second ; summary of audits conducted in certain Ministries ; third , rapid diagnostic assessments of Ministries that have not been audited ; fourth , administrative practices and the State of law ; fifth , analysis of the general status of the civil service ; sixth , inquiry into the image of the public sector ; and , seventh , ethics , professional conduct and motivation of State employees .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .  
There may be merit in some of these assertions , but this is only correct when the public sector is not well trained ; when its size can not be justified on the output and quality of services offered ; or when the policies it delivers run counter to the accumulation of national wealth , efficient delivery of social services or administration of justice .  
They are also aimed at creating a lean , efficient , highly motivated and dutiful civil service , based on the job requirements and carefully evaluated professional requirements of each Ministry and public institution .  
The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .  
The new Mission was able adequately to ensure the presence of the international community and the direct support of the United Nations for the peace process , especially in the areas that proved to be most critical to the implementation of the Chapultepec Agreement : public security , constitutional and legislative reform , the land-transfer programme and the transfer of rural human settlements .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The surge in media and public interest during the fiftieth anniversary resulted in the Department 's tripling its production of backgrounders , fact-sheets , notes for speakers and special radio and television programmes , all of which were transmitted through pouch and electronic means to specific audiences worldwide .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
It firmly declares the will of all political forces in Bulgaria Mr . Lukanov having been an active member of Parliament for the last seven years not to permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the path towards economic and political reform or to infringe on the peaceful and lawful process of political and public life , including the forthcoming presidential elections at the end of this month .  
That is why in many African countries today Governments continue with determination to carry out bold and difficult reforms , reflected , inter alia , in the improved and more rational use of public funds , in the opening of our economies to international trade and in the creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise and to the transparent management of public affairs with , most importantly , all sectors of society participating in the work of national development , in the interests of all .  
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
Further , it had established a family planning and education policy which allowed it , through mother and child public health services , to keep the population informed regarding every kind of health and nutritional problem , and it applied strict primary and community health care policies in villages and rural centres .  
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
FATTAH ( Egypt ) said that , in view of the major responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in recent years and the increased attention it was giving to social and economic matters , the Organization had a proportionately greater need to secure the support of world public opinion through the invaluable role currently played by the information media .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
Ratification of the Convention had also had a positive educational impact on the public , had satisfied a long-standing demand by women 's organizations and had stimulated legislative , administrative and other measures on the part of individual ministries .  
Non-governmental organizations , particularly those in the north , were doing a remarkable job in the fields of advocacy and protection , and , thanks to the joint action of the international community , States and non-governmental organizations , international public opinion was becoming favourable to the idea of controlling and combating all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief .  
The Constitution contained provisions entitling women to remedial and affirmative action , with a view to enabling them to participate in political , economic and social life and gain access to positions in public and private institutions on an equal footing with men .  
To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
With regard to the human rights of women , particularly the right to equal status , which was dealt with in the Beijing Platform for Action , he stressed that the first woman prime minister in the world had been elected in Sri Lanka and that the election of Mrs . Kumaratunga to the office of President by an overwhelming popular vote indicated that Sri Lankans accepted the role of women in political and social life and their holding the highest public offices .  
Increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially by , inter alia , formulating or strengthening and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ;  
A strengthened Centre could not only mobilize public awareness but also provide vital assistance to Governments and non-governmental organizations in the field of advisory services and training with a view to facilitating implementation and understanding of human rights instruments at the national level .  
In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
SHAH ( India ) said that India , a pluralistic nation with well-established humanistic traditions of tolerance , harmony and non-violence , guaranteed fundamental human rights to all its citizens ; those rights were enforced by an independent judiciary and jealously guarded by a free and vigilant press , an articulate public opinion and a vast network of non-governmental organizations .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
However , the progress made towards establishing the institutional and physical infrastructure for the active involvement of the public and private sector in the economy , though notable , fell short of expectations , which appeared to have been overly optimistic .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The liaison offices will maintain contacts with their respective host Governments on issues relevant to the missions ; relay relevant information ( including media reports ) to United Nations Headquarters and to the three missions ; undertake liaison tasks on behalf of the missions ; provide assessments and advice to other United Nations agencies operating in the region ; and provide timely and accurate public information on United Nations activities to local and international media .  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
The report , which shall be a classified State and regional document , shall be drawn up in accordance with the format and contents determined by the Security Commission and shall include all naval , air , land and public security data needed for the information provided to be complete , transparent and verifiable , solely and exclusively by the organs of the model established in article 47 of this Treaty or by those designated by them ;  
To provide information , within the Security Commission , on the respective military and public security expenditures approved in their budgets for the current fiscal year , taking as a reference the " Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures " adopted by the United Nations on 12 December 1990 , under the provisions of article 52 ( k ) of this Treaty ; and ,  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; for participation in public decision-making ; for equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
The quality of life of the people depends , among other economic , social , environmental and cultural factors on the physical conditions and spatial characteristics of our villages , towns and cities .  City lay-out and aesthetics , land-use patterns , population and building densities , transportation and ease of access for all to basic goods , services and public amenities have crucial bearing on the livability of settlements .  
Objectives of this endeavour include protecting public health , providing for safety and security conditions , education , and social integration , promoting equality , respect for diversity and cultural identities , increased accessibility for persons with disabilities , and preservation of historic , spiritual , religious and culturally significant buildings and districts , respecting local landscapes and treating the local environment with respect and care .  
This requires , as appropriate , establishing policies , laws and regulations for both public and private activities , encouraging responsible private activities in all fields , facilitating community groups ' participation , adopting transparent procedures , encouraging public-spirited leadership and public-private partnerships , and helping people to understand and exercise their rights and responsibilities through open and effective participatory processes , universal education and information dissemination .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
To promote social integration , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , recognizing the importance of volunteer contributions and in close cooperation with non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , the cooperative sector and public and private foundations , should :  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for human settlements development and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary and individual voluntary contributions ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
As stressed above , criteria and indicators defined at the national level are aimed at improving the quantity and quality of information available to decision makers and the general public about progress towards sustainable forest management , and thus to assist in the policy and decision-making process ; the ultimate aim in this regard is to further improve forest management practices over time .  
To avoid alarmist or misleading awareness campaigns , they need reliable and representative information - e.g . , on various forest types ( boreal , temperate , tropical , wet , dry , natural , plantations , monocultures ) ; ( e ) The general public and media . 
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals for filling any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situation of African countries ;  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
With strong support from the interim secretariat , bilateral donors and United Nations agencies , national awareness seminars are widespread and are doing a good job of educating key national actors , in both the public and private sectors , about the significance of the Convention .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peace-keeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peace-keeping operations are conducted .  
Considering that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
Acting on the recommendation of the Tangier Declaration , the General Assembly adopted resolution 49 / 136 on public administration and development , in which it recognized the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , and also recognized the need for strengthened public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the people .  
The specific topics under the theme " Capacity-building in public administration " were the enhancement of policy development capacity , organizational strengthening , improved civil service systems , the strengthening of financial management for development , human resource development for the public sector , and the development of administrative capacities for post-conflict and crisis conditions .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
From 1980 emphasis has been placed on the role of the public sector in promoting the economic development of developing countries , with auxiliary activities concentrating on the role of qualified national personnel in the social and economic development of developing countries , and specialized topics such as the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade , the development of human resources , or United Nations programmes of action for African economic recovery and development .  
In the area of public administration , programme activities focus on strengthening administrative and organizational systems at both the central and local levels , improving management methods and practices through modern management techniques and information technology , and legal frameworks and programmes that are sensitive to the global economy .  
For the past 45 years , pursuant to its various legislative mandates , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .  
Current assessment of most developing and transitional economies demonstrates that national Governments may need international support and cooperation in improving their public administration systems and training their personnel for initiating and implementing dynamic social programmes .  
Each conference made major recommendations , which will have an impact on the ways in which national Governments will function , and point to the need for an effective and efficient public administration system in planning and implementing those recommendations and for the support and cooperation of relevant United Nations and other international and regional institutions in assisting Governments to improve their public administration systems .  
Public administration will continue to fulfil critical functions in development , supporting measures for economic growth , protecting the environment , determining the relationship between the public and the private sector , reducing poverty and illiteracy and other social development activities , thereby achieving the goals of sustainable development .  
To fulfil critical future-shaping functions , public administration needs to establish a dynamic people-oriented system through strategic restructuring for transparency and participation , as well as outstanding professionalism by attracting bright , energetic , visionary people into public administration .  
That process is time-consuming , expensive and delicate , but such a deliberative process is the only hope for genuine development , which in turn depends upon talented , skilled and sensitive public administrators for implementation . 
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
To strengthen effective collaboration and coordination among various programmes in governance and public management currently carried out by various United Nations agencies , including Bretton-Woods institutions such as the World Bank and IMF , it is recommended that the consultative group include representation from all relevant United Nations agencies , regional commissions and the World Bank . The group will also be open to other interregional and regional governmental organizations and appropriate international or regional professional and research institutions .  
Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .  
The immediate strategy would include the assessment of national absorptive capacities , human and capital ; the definition of policy issues and drafting of national policies ; the restructuring and operation of key ministries for implementation of the defined policies ; the restoration of management systems and tools ( e.g . , personnel , audit , information ) ; the restoration and management of justice and public safety systems ; the retention and enlistment of professional human resources ; and the provision of crash training and retraining programmes .  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
Professional staff in the Office of the Spokesperson should be assigned departments concerned with major news stories and should attend relevant departmental staff meetings , and receive regular briefings from senior staff in their department of assignment on the public information aspects of the work of the department and important decisions made .  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
33 In addition , the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts encompassed discussions on the development of an adequate legal basis for combatting corruption , including rules and regulations on the conduct of public office holders as well as clear statutory prohibitions , penalties , and procedures for investigating , bringing to trial and punishing persons engaged in corrupt acts .  
Article 5 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that no law enforcement official may inflict , instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war , a threat to national security , international political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
A state of war ( in 49 countries ) , a threat of war ( in 46 countries ) , a threat to national security ( in 52 countries ) , internal political instability ( in 52 countries ) and other public emergency ( in 49 countries ) is not sufficient justification for torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
Israel , however , reported that the Landau Commission for the Inquiry into the Investigation Techniques of the General Security Services ( GSS ) concluded that if a public emergency developed , or whenever an imminent threat to national security was at hand , GSS investigators would be able to use " moderate physical pressure " to gain important information from those who knowingly endangered public safety .  
In areas in which public interest is lacking , there is no requirement of effective and beneficial use , and regulations and planning are disregarded and discouraged , experience shows that the role of markets has not been as relevant as is assumed by the theoretical justification of the model ; ( f ) Such areas are already experiencing problems due to the monopolization of water rights and related public services .  
Conflicts have not been resolved by markets , and the water administration is to a large extent unable to address them ; ( g ) Water legislation should include water marketing principles , established within a balanced structure in which property protected water rights are accommodated to public interest , including the principle of effective and beneficial use and environmental protection .  
In order to maintain public finances on a sound footing while simultaneously meeting social commitments , the Government implemented tax reforms by widening the tax base ; increasing tax rates ; restructuring tax brackets to increase progressivity of personal income tax ; and by raising excise taxes to finance an increase in pensions and educational spending .  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
36 Panama reported on legislative amendments to its Penal Code , dealing , inter alia , with the criminalization and penalization of physical or psychological aggression , violence and intimidation , corruption of minors and indecent assault , incest and the commission or knowledge of an act of domestic violence by a public or private official , as well as the failure to inform the proper authorities of such an act .  
The possibility that public awareness , educational or other material designed to prevent or reduce illicit demand may draw attention to the availability and means of abuse of prohibited drugs within certain segments of the population is a difficult issue that remains to be resolved .  
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Recognizing the need for effective government and efficient public administrative services to be responsive to the needs of the people , to ensure universal access to quality services and productive assets and to create an enabling environment for sustainable development and provide quality services ,  
Reaffirming the importance of promoting cooperation among all countries in enhancing the quality of public administration , including , inter alia , the promotion of a participatory approach to development , the provision of basic social services , the development of policies to eradicate poverty and the establishment of an enabling environment for economic growth , social justice and sustainable development ,  
Stressing the importance of an efficient and effective public sector as the basic framework for stable and sustainable institutional and human development in all countries ,  
Noting that improved efficiency in government requires strengthened and efficient public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the economy and the civil society and the provision of quality services ,  
Undertaking research on effective systems and procedures in public administration , with particular attention devoted to the civil service systems , administrative structures and administrative reorganization , decentralization , aid management , accountability , financial management , metropolitan and local governance , approaches to rehabilitation and reconstruction of government and administrative services in post-conflict situations , and to ensure the timely distribution of these research results to Member States ;  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
They point out , inter alia , that justice requires that everyone be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal , in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( General Assembly resolution 217 A ( III ) ) , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( General Assembly resolution A ( XXI ) , annex ) and other United Nations instruments .  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
Along those lines , it was suggested that the requirement should be limited to sensitive areas of public service or to cases where an abuse of power might be suspected and that the last sentence should be revised to read : " All information provided shall be treated as confidential but may be disclosed at a country 's discretion within the framework of special procedures . "  
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
Within [ a ] [ the ] stated period [ of one / two years ] after separation from public service , public officials holding managerial positions shall , within the framework of national law , obtain governmental permission prior to accepting employment or consultancy assignments from business or private concerns that are in [ direct ] financial relationship with the governmental department or agency in which such officials were employed .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed the willingness of his Government to take immediate , active steps to promote crop substitution and rural development , in close cooperation with UNDCP and other States , by purchasing products such as wheat , cotton and rice from Afghan farmers at prices higher than they could obtain from illicit crops , by contributing to road construction , and by assisting in preventive education and public awareness campaigns for Afghan farmers .

Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .

The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy .

Contributing to this improvement were the slight deceleration of inflation ( as of July 1996 , 17.6 per cent on an annual basis ) ; increase in available foreign exchange owing to a growing number of visitors , both Haitians living abroad and foreigners ; and strengthening of the gourde resulting from the inflow of foreign currency by bilateral or multilateral donors to finance public investments .

Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 13 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments .

In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .

Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .

The representatives of the broadcasters - both private and public - who attended the event discussed at length the increasing impact television has on decision-making by alerting world attention to international conflicts and threats to peace and security and its potential role in sharpening the focus on other major issues , including economic , social and cultural issues , and in promoting understanding among peoples .  
Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .  
In the face of reassertion of ethnic - some may call it tribal - identities , of revival of neo-liberal ideas based on extreme individualism and deregulation , as well as of other centrifugal forces , it becomes imperative at the international level to insist on general , as opposed to particular , State interests and to work towards the development of a public order of the international community .

The World Conference on Human Rights ( Vienna , June 1993 ) in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action stated that human rights education , training and public information were essential for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding , tolerance and peace .  
Governments should play an active role in the implementation of the programme of the Decade through the development of national plans of action for human rights education , the introduction or strengthening of national human rights curricula in their formal educational systems , the conducting of national information campaigns on human rights and the opening of public access to human rights resource , information and training centres , as well as through enhanced donor support for relevant voluntary funds and international and national human rights education programmes .

In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that BOT and other forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to re-allocate resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
It was noted , however , that BOT and similar projects could be quite complex and that their implementation required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper entitled " Our Future Homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .

In the light of the foregoing , Ukraine considers as timely and topical the proposal contained in paragraph 3 of the Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 26 entitled Minimum humanitarian standards for considering the possibility of reviewing national legislation relevant to situations of public emergency with a view to ensuring that it meets the requirements of the rule of law and does not involve discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , sex , language , religion or social origin .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
It was the Taliban 's inhuman treatment of women including their public chain-lashing , indiscriminate amputation and mutilation their executions of televisions and video cassette recorders , their burning of cassettes and office files , and their destruction of irreplaceable historic artifacts that have earned them international condemnation .  
Through its promotional activities , UNHCR sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , and to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to the Office , including by means of their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
In view of the current serious situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , the Committee intends to encourage renewed , intensified efforts by non-governmental organizations to organize and coordinate sustained campaigns in order to inform public opinion and to promote national and international action in support of United Nations resolutions and the Committee 's objectives .  
Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
While disseminating information about the Court through traditional methods is to be welcomed and further encouraged , my delegation believes that the use of advanced technology in enhancing public awareness about the Court and its activities should be improved .  To this end , we express strong support for the steps taken by the Court to take advantage of the benefits provided by the electronic media , such as the Internet , and in particular the construction of its own website , which should facilitate public access to the Court 's voluminous documents .  
Despite the negative public perception created in some countries and the fears aroused about the dangers of nuclear proliferation , nuclear energy remains a viable and attractive energy option for many countries , and particularly for the fossil fuel-deficient developing countries .  
The beginning of the millennium should therefore be marked by a mobilization of national and international public opinion , directed particularly towards young people , inviting them to make a difference and encouraging them to break once and for all with the behaviour patterns and attitudes of the recent and the more distant past , characterized by crises , wars and violence .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
Today , as we celebrate the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People , my delegation would like to express to the Chairman and members of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People its appreciation for the role it has played in mobilizing international public opinion in support of the Palestinian people in their legitimate and just struggle to regain their inalienable rights to self-determination and to establish their own independent State on their national soil .  
Terrorism is the wicked result of widespread lawlessness and the violent obstruction of public participation , which in its various forms and manifestations threatens human societies at the national , regional and international levels . 
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , private sector , cooperatives and civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
The Government of Poland stated that in public elementary and secondary schools , religious instruction shall be organized for pupils whose parents or legal guardians express a wish that their children should attend such instruction or classes and in secondary schools such instruction shall be organized for pupils whose parents or who themselves express such a wish .  
Furthermore , in areas inhabited by a considerable number ( one quarter ) of members of an ethnic group , designations and inscriptions of a topographical nature set up by territorial authorities and public agencies must be bilingual .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Non-governmental organizations provide a wide variety of services to help orient and settle new arrivals , including temporary housing , interpretation , accompanying individuals to governmental agencies , guidance in seeking employment and permanent housing , orienting family members to public and commercial services such as schools and stores , etc .  
Devising and disseminating such policies with detailed practical examples providing guidance to all those concerned , in the form of declarations , guides , codes of good practice , etc . , can make a positive contribution towards raising public awareness of different types of overt or covert discrimination , and thereby to their effective prevention .  
Their employees are provided with public transport but not food and , generally speaking , their living conditions are harsh and inhumane , leading one migrant worker to say It 's exploitation ; the living conditions are unbearable , like in a prison .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
Yet its subsequent , rapid spread through tainted blood and heterosexual activity increased public concern , leading to actions that , if taken earlier , would have saved many lives .  
States should review and reform public health legislation to ensure that they adequately address the public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Independent , speedy and effective legal and / or administrative procedures for seeking redress , containing such features as fast-tracking for cases where the complainant is terminally ill , investigatory powers to address systemic cases of discrimination in policies and procedures , ability to bring cases under pseudonym and representative complaints , including the possibility of public interest organizations bringing cases on behalf of people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
Despite the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports , insufficient publicity is still given to laws and governmental acts , to such an extent that they are unknown not only to the general public , but also to sectors of the public administration _ especially the peripheral authorities responsible for public order , who take advantage of their ignorance to deny legally granted rights to applicants .  
The Bank recommended three security pillars : ( a ) a mandatory tax-financed public pillar designed to alleviate poverty and coinsure against a multitude of risks ; ( b ) a mandatory fully funded but privately managed pillar ( based on personal savings accounts or occupational plans ) to handle people 's savings ; and ( c ) a supplementary voluntary pillar ( again based on personal savings or occupational plans ) for people who want more income and insurance .  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Until waste management authorities overcome these institutional shortcomings and develop a more flexible management structure , responsive to the needs of public , private and community sectors , isolated schemes will remain good examples of " best practice demonstrations " and will not be incorporated into the overall waste management system .  
The Committee considers that it is urgent , as a preventive measure , to change the gender selective approach in the law ; to develop educational courses to empower women ; to educate police personnel ; to introduce gender sensitive courses for judges , public prosecutors and lawyers ; to increase the number of shelters for battered women with children ; and to mobilize the media to introduce regular programmes on the negative consequences of violence .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
Briefly , almost all the capacity-building initiatives supporting the themes mentioned in Agenda 21 can be grouped into eight main areas - environmental strategy and policy , macroeconomic strategy , consensus-building , environmental management capacity , normative and legal frameworks , scientific and socioeconomic research , technology transfer and public outreach .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
Nevertheless , such regulation is included in separate legal texts concerning particular areas of public life where protection of personal data is needed , notably internal affairs , citizenship and personal status issues , medical care and , to a certain extent , the execution of penal sanctions .

The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
The establishment and functioning of the Commission on the Strengthening of the Justice System should provide the country with a historic opportunity to undertake , based on a broad debate , a judicial reform that meets society 's tremendous need for an independent , professionally sound justice system which can restore public confidence .  
The States parties to the present Statute and public international organizations , so authorized to do so by their constituent instrument , may at any time declare that they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement , in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation , the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning :  
Reportedly , the use of hundreds of tons of depleted uranium ( DU ) bullets in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm ( 1991 ) coupled with unexplained illnesses experienced by veterans who had been exposed to numerous potentially toxic substances have focused public attention on a possible link between these illnesses and the health hazards associated with DU munitions . 
According to the relevant regulations , the Office shall be an autonomous constitutional body with legal capacity in public law and shall be responsible for protecting the constitutional and fundamental rights of individuals and the community and overseeing compliance by public authorities with their duties and the proper provision of public services to the citizenry .  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
On the political level , active public life was generally closed to them , apart from a few isolated cases of women rulers5 and others who played a part in " town hall " discussions of social issues .  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
Theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles had become another activity of organized crime that employed methods such as corruption of public officials and bribery in the private sector , thereby undermining both democratic and economic institutions .  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Those measures included the establishment of a national standing committee composed of law enforcement officers and academic experts charged with undertaking research on various forms of crime usually carried out by criminal organizations and of a department of public security specialized in organized crime , as well as the development of specialized training programmes for law enforcement personnel and public awareness campaigns to sensitize the Saudi public to the dangers posed by organized crime .  
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
JUNIC agreed on the need to develop a joint message of the United Nations with global appeal , to be based on a critical analysis of both the positive and negative feedback from the recent coverage and public debate about the role and achievements of the Organization , and to consider a methodology of media outreach that would successfully counter the effects of the existing information overload .  
To improve coordination of public information activities , JUNIC decided to establish an open-ended working group based in New York to meet on a monthly or bi-monthly basis in the inter-sessional period and discuss matters of mutual concern , and also to revive the bi-monthly JUNIC Information Bulletin , prepared by the JUNIC secretariat and distributed electronically to the members of JUNIC and to directors of information of bilateral development agencies , as a means of keeping informed and better coordinating the preparation of information products and activities .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies submitted by Bulgaria be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
The Committee also recommends that a comprehensive and integrated public information campaign be elaborated with a view to preventing and combating all forms of abuse of children and that all necessary measures be taken to ensure the physical and psychological recovery and the social reintegration of children victims of the war , in the light of article 39 of the Convention .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by Ethiopia be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies presented by Panama be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
They include : a Swedish firm with a successful record of restructuring private companies , which helped in the design and start-up of the overall change process , and whose former chief executive officer continues to advise UNDP 2001 ; a Canadian expert on change management ; an American expert on public sector change ; and a leading information technology management group from the United States .  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
Public-sector ICT applications include distance learning and continuing professional development ; road traffic management ; disabled support services ; air-traffic control ; health-care networks ; electronic tendering for contracts ; and public administration applications .  ICT applications are increasing the efficiency of public services in areas such as automated or computer-assisted translation ; one stop shopping for government information ; applications designed to limit environmental degradation ; citizens and emergency support services ; and services to support inter-community meetings .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
It was stated that strict liability was a deviation from the general principle of tort law whereby a person was liable for his or her own negligence and , as such , was accepted in national law for exceptional reasons of public interest , such as certain strict liability regimes of persons conducting unreasonably hazardous activities .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
A different approach was suggested , based on the discussion of the issue of liability of certification authorities , in the context of which it had been understood that , in the event of erroneous identification of a person or erroneous attribution of a public key to a person , the certification authority would be held liable for the loss sustained by any injured party unless the certification authority could demonstrate that it had exerted its best efforts to avoid the error ( see above , para .  58 ) .  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
Constant dialogue among the main social , economic and political actors will be necessary in order to move forward effectively on such basic issues as land , taxation , justice , public security , decentralization , local development and multiculturalism .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
However , while recognizing the important potential in innovative financial packages and new types of public-private partnerships , the Panel emphasized the continuing importance of international public finance and of existing commitments to it , and the need to promote the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
It encompassed detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which had been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
Thirdly , even allowing , though not conceding , that issues of international humanitarian law should be negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament , our methods of work do not guarantee that we will attain the aim of totally abolishing anti _ personnel landmines with the speed required by international public opinion because more than 25,000 innocent people are falling victim to these indiscriminate weapons each year . 
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
Reaffirming that the initiative on the pilot management scheme presented by the ECLAC secretariat is aimed at strengthening the role of the organization as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ,  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
Taken together , these developments have posed major dilemmas regarding the professional behaviour and values of the public service : How can such traditional administrative values as accountability , fairness and integrity be reconciled with new citizenship values - transparency , responsiveness and responsibility - and with such managerial values as performance , efficiency , and results ?  
In any event , the conditions under which social services are provided must be determined by the State and reflect the rights of citizens , not simply be the result of a private contractual relation between individuals and private firms .  30 .  The State must reclaim the central role in the formulation of public policies , which it sometimes has lost to the private sector and international financial institutions .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
Before the astonished eyes of a silent public , we have in recent years been able to " see " the gravest violations of the right to life for ethnic and racial motives , death from hunger in atrocious conditions of thousands upon thousands of children and people of all ages , in short , atrocities that in the old world with less intercommunication only came to be known many years later through books and distant reports , and were sometimes never known at all by the public .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
However , although the National Civil Police is a professional public security body with the potential to execute modern and democratic public security policies , the model established by the peace accords has not been consolidated without the occurrence of distortions .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
The Secretariat will further be required to assist developing country Parties , on request , particularly those in Africa , in the preparation of their national , subregional and regional communications ; to analyze , collate and present those communications so as to facilitate their consideration by the COP ; to facilitate the consultative and coordination processes as set out in the relevant regional implementation annexes ; to ensure coordination with the secretariats of other relevant bodies ; and to assist in promoting public awareness of the Convention to Combat Desertification ( CCD ) .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
Those delegations stressed the importance of disseminating information on the activities of the Organization throughout the world and the strategic role played by the Department of Public Information as information disseminator in order to enhance the image of the Organization and to promote an informed understanding of the work of the United Nations among the peoples of the world , through the implementation of mandated programme activities .  3 .  A number of delegations expressed their appreciation for the efforts made to streamline and restructure public information programmes , in the light of the reduction in resources .  
Basic surveys and studies for administrative reform were continued , and action on a number of issues is under active consideration , including the establishment of unified salary scales for the public service and restructuring of the civil service with employment based on qualifications and equal opportunity .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
The promotion and maintenance of the child 's health through strengthened safe motherhood ; breastfeeding , and improved weaning ; universal immunization ; control of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections ; and other existing public health programmes . 
For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
The Joint Border Commission continues to meet on a regular basis and to focus on resolving the disputed border areas it had previously identified , but the results of its work have thus far fallen short of the expectations and the public statements of intent of the two parties in this regard .

These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
Whereas in almost all countries of the world , with the exception of two , women have the legal right to vote and to hold public office on an equal basis with men , in practice relatively few women have been elected to national legislatures , and even fewer occupy key decision-making positions , including in international organizations such as the United Nations .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
The effort has attracted strong and high _ level political support from a large number of countries ; it is overwhelmingly supported by the public , leading NGOs and a growing band of senior military figures .  
Even though it is more complete than article 47 of Additional Protocol I , it does not differ much from that text as far as the definition of a mercenary is concerned and it lends itself to different and perhaps contradictory interpretations , when it is States themselves that , on the initiative of their Governments , hire private firms to perform services connected with public order and security . 
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of the present Declaration ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , the private sector , cooperatives and the civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
Constraints to external communication and public affairs identified through the change management exercise were : ( a ) unclear policy messages in written and oral communications , which are frequently jargon-ridden and lacking in hard facts ; ( b ) uneven collaboration between DPA and line units ; ( c ) a media-shy culture in UNDP as a whole ; and ( d ) insufficient financial investment in communication .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs , criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Guideline 3 : States should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV / AIDS , that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV / AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Recommends that long-term public awareness and information programmes related to natural disasters , including those induced by El Ni �� and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , be integrated into comprehensive national disaster management programmes that focus on preventive strategies for risk reduction and that those programmes be included as integral elements of United Nations support for social and economic development programmes ;  
Jordan also supported resolution 51 / 210 , in which the General Assembly had renewed its affirmation that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstance unjustifiable .  
The conferences , held in South Africa , focused on reorganizing the judiciary ; adopting a bill of rights ; developing affirmative action programmes ; designing a nationwide public defender service ; comparing institutional models for enforcing a constitutional guarantee of gender equality , and evaluating electoral systems .  
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments , and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , generation of employment , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
They had urged the development of Israeli / Palestinian / NGO cooperation , based on mutual understanding and commitment to a comprehensive , just and lasting peace , and had pledged to generate public support for the Palestinian people through campaigns focusing on the themes of the future of Jerusalem , Israeli settlements and their expansion in East Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza , and the Palestinian refugees ' right of return .  
UNHCR \ x { e5b8 } promotional activities sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , as well as to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to UNHCR , including through their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
Missions , in response to ad hoc requests from Governments , on issues of economic reform ; improving macroeconomic stability ; restructuring government budgets and designing taxation and public expenditure policies ; facilitating the transition to a market-based economy ; and efficient management of public enterprises and creation of viable public institutions ; ( ii ) Group training .  
The Ministerial Council reaffirmed its absolute and unwavering belief in Iraq 's obligation to comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular those pertaining to the release of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and detainees ; cooperate fully with the Special Commission in its investigation of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction ; return all public and private property to Kuwait ; continue to comply fully with the compensation mechanism ; and refrain from all hostile or provocative acts directed against Kuwait and neighbouring States , pursuant to resolution 949 ( 1994 ) .  
Further , a stable and transparent legal framework that provides for respect for and enforcement of property rights , the rule of law and the tackling of corruption , as well as transparent , efficient and accountable public administration , are conducive to domestic and foreign investment and capital inflows .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
In light of article 44 , paragraph 6 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and the written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Finally , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
We are particularly happy to note that an excellent cooperation based on full mutual understanding has been established between the command of MPF , the Albanian authorities and the Albanian public , in general , which constitutes a solid basis for success in helping to alleviate and resolve the crisis . 
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
Violations committed on national territory , most of which are considered to be justiciable offences , include : misappropriation of public funds , misuse of company assets , corruption , tax and customs evasion , financial speculation , fraudulent or unlawful enrichment , exploitation of illegal labour and migrant workers , etc .  
Given the extent of violations of the right to a healthy environment , the international community expressed its profound concern , at the 1992 Earth Summit , noting that some international movements of toxic wastes were in contravention of national legislation and existing international instruments , seriously damaging the environment and public health in all countries , particularly the developing ones .  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
In addition , such human settlements provide equal opportunity for a productive and freely chosen livelihood ; equal access to economic resources , including the right to inheritance , the ownership of land and other property , credit , natural resources and appropriate technologies ; equal opportunity for personal , spiritual , religious , cultural and social development ; equal opportunity for participation in public decision-making ; equal rights and obligations with regard to the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources ; and equal access to mechanisms to ensure that rights are not violated .  
Measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Observers presented examples of cases where , in their opinion , persons belonging to minorities were unable to participate effectively in cultural , religious , social , economic and public life and where their participation in decision _ making at the national and regional levels was limited .  
Ms . Estebanez said that the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe had established undertakings on the part of States aimed at the protection of the languages of historical or regional minorities in Europe , through comprehensive treatment of linguistic minority issues in the areas of : education ; the use of minority languages in dealings with the administrative authorities and public services and in administrative proceedings ; cultural activities ; economic and social life ; and trans-border contacts .  
In order to attract FDI , countries were invited to continue initiatives in such areas as a stable macroeconomic environment , transparent and accountable public administration , respect for property rights and the rule of law , the quality of labour , improvement of infrastructure , entrepreneurial and institutional capabilities and simplified administrative and regulatory frameworks .  
One of the main objectives that the Transitional Government is committed to achieving , as was made public in a statement on 25 July 1996 , is to set up a strong basis for lasting peace through the implementation of a peace process sustained by dialogue and for which the ultimate goal is to build up national institutions by consensus .  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
Whilst the environmental objectives of MEAs have received broad public support , it has been increasingly recognized that MEAs involve important economic and developmental issues , and that compliance costs may differ widely across developed and developing country parties , thus raising issues related to equity .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
The Government of Ireland recently published a national anti-poverty strategy , Sharing in Progress , which represents a unique initiative in the development of public policy in Ireland , it being the first time that an Irish Government has formulated a strategic plan to address the issue of social exclusion in its society .  
In Liechtenstein , non-governmental organizations would continue to play a critical role in that process , which would focus , in particular , on motivating women to participate in national political life ; providing academic and vocational guidance for adolescent girls ; facilitating the compatibility of women 's professional and family life , and building public awareness about the problem of violence against women and children .  
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
One important task of the United Nations was that of providing States , Governments , non-governmental organizations and representatives of public organizations with better information with a view to seeking solutions to urgent problems encountered by most of the world 's countries , promoting international assistance and implementing specific economic and social programmes and projects at the national , regional and international levels . 
At the resumed fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the question of public administration and development had been considered , with a high level of representation and participation ; it was regrettable that the resolution adopted on the subject reflected only partially the valuable ideas and suggestions presented by delegations . 
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
His Government attached the highest priority to efforts to combat poverty and , in that context , sought to increase employment opportunities and improve the quality of life for Bolivians in order to build a modern , decentralized and participatory State through policies favouring citizen involvement , educational reform and privatization of the major public enterprises .  
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
Although Nicaragua had been able to make progress in solving the problem of the external debt , through the cooperation of the international community and friendly countries , such as the Russian Federation , which had recently announced the cancellation of the debt balance , the external debt was still a very heavy burden which impeded economic growth and inhibited public and private investment .  
While the economic reform and political stability programmes had re-established confidence in the country , Cambodia still needed a considerable volume of external assistance especially in the areas of budget support , administrative reform , mine clearance , resettlement and reintegration , agriculture , social services , the maintenance of public utility services and the rehabilitation of transport systems and infrastructure .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
The Platform for Action adopted at the Conference was established as a powerful tool for the empowerment of women , aimed at removing all the obstacles to womens active participation in public and private life by promoting their full and equal participation in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making processes .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
The model is a good example of successful institutional public / private-sector cooperation involving political , social and economic actors for creating an environment conducive to enterprise development .  
On a collective basis , symbolic measures intended to provide moral reparation , such as formal public recognition by the State of its responsibility , or official declarations aimed at restoring victims ' dignity , commemorative ceremonies , naming of public thoroughfares or the erection of monuments , help to discharge the duty of remembrance .  
While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
Its purpose is above all to alert the public and world leaders to the role of the oceans in planetary survival , to the threats facing the oceans and to more peaceful and sustainable use of the oceans , as well as to suggest ways of strengthening the legal and institutional framework for ocean governance at the national , regional and global levels .  
In subsequent statements , particularly , those entitled " political development policies " of the executive branches , emphasis was again placed on respecting human dignity and integrity ; ensuring civil rights and freedom ; defending public trials and the right to a lawyer ; fostering an independent mass media ; and fostering the principles of pluralism and diversity .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
He said that an understanding of the basic underlying technology of the Internet was essential , as the technological limitations and the possibilities of the Internet shaped potential public policy options .  
In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
Breakdowns in public health as a result of insufficient coverage and the poor operation and maintenance of existing water supply systems are now frequent , though rarely reported until spectacular rates of epidemiological transmission occur .  
Assistance to Governments , at their request , in creating an enabling institutional and legislative environment for the effective contribution of public and private utilities to the provision of water supply and sanitation to urban and rural communities .  
These institutions succeeded where traditional public programmes failed , and she supported UNCTADs initiative aimed at creating an essential direct link between private investors and micro finance institutions in developing countries . 
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
Partnerships between the public and private sectors , which are becoming common in many developing countries , ensure that essential skills and theory acquired through formal education are complemented by enterprise-based practical training .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
These seminars have been intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials _ judicial , administrative , military and law enforcement _ involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
In order for countries to have a real chance to eradicate poverty , they must achieve sustained economic growth , accompanied by increased public expenditure in the social sector , which could take place only in an expanding national economy .

It was pleased to note that many countries had taken legal measures to eliminate cultural , religious or traditional practices , including female genital mutilation , that violated the human rights of women and girls.Although in keeping with the duty of States to protect all human rights , such actions were insufficient by themselves to end those practices and should be supplemented with education and public awareness campaigns .

Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
Points of public concern include matters such as continuity in the provision of public services ; adherence to environmental protection , health , safety and quality standards set by the host country ; fairness of prices charged to the public ; non-discriminatory treatment of customers or users , full disclosure of information pertaining to the operation of infrastructure facilities and the flexibility needed to meet changed conditions , including expansion of the service to meet additional demand .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In cases where public ownership and control is desired , direct private financing as well as infrastructure operation under commercial principles may be achieved by establishing a separate legal entity controlled by the Government to own and operate the project .  
Where the facility is operated pursuant to a governmental licence , private ownership of physical assets ( e.g . a telecommunication network ) is often separable from the licence to provide the service to the public ( e.g . long-distance telephone services ) , in that the licence can be withdrawn by the competent public authority under certain circumstances .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant public authority conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .

In countries where the law contemplates more than one type of procedure for compulsory acquisition , it may be desirable to authorize the competent public authorities to carry out all acquisitions required for privately financed infrastructure projects pursuant to the most efficient of those procedures , such as the special procedures that in some countries apply for reasons of compelling public need ( see chap .  
While rules of private international law often allow considerable freedom to choose the law governing commercial contracts , that freedom is in some countries restricted for contracts and legal relationships that are not qualified as commercial , such as , for instance , certain contracts entered into by public authorities of the host country ( for example , guarantees and assurances by the Government , power purchase or fuel supply commitments by a public authority ) or contracts with consumers .  
The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
Achieving an efficient system of services may require innovative modes of provision that entail an adequate mix of public , private and non-profit participation and mobilizing new resources from the supply side ; basic social services should be financed through taxation , not user fees , which , in many cases , never revert to the facilities for which they were intended ;  
The opening of many countries to global financial markets has created situations in which Governments , at both local and national levels , have new access to opportunities to borrow , yet many of the officials concerned have little or no experience with the workings of financial markets and no accurate concept of their abilities to repay the loans.This has led to numerous cases of potential public default or bankruptcy .  
That provision had been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly with regard to the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .  
Corruption in both the public sector and the private sector , regardless of the level at which it occurs , can jeopardize free trade , distort competitiveness and undermine the stability upon which the free market system is based . 12 Companies may resort to bribery as a means of bypassing existing trade barriers or reducing national tariffs and expediting international trade .

The discussion revolved around providing specific time frames towards meeting the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to counter the declines in past years ; developing each countrys own comprehensive strategy , including the establishment of sound macroeconomic policies and national partnerships in an effort to use ODA most effectively ; and the growing concerns regarding global public goods .  
Consideration of global public goods that is based on solid assessment of public goods needs , outlining the value added and comparative advantage of new efforts , taking into account the existing experiences of national , regional and international efforts in order to avoid duplication .  
Urges United Nations organizations , the international community and non-governmental organizations to continue their efforts aimed at the enhanced ownership and participation of the eastern Timorese , known as Timorization , in East Timor , in the social , economic and administrative infrastructure and , in this regard , stresses the need for capacity-building , inter alia , in such areas as education , health , agriculture and rural development , the judiciary , governance and public administration , security and law and order ; .  
It is thus absolutely incomprehensible to us that , in this day and age , the mind of a human being could entertain the senseless idea of destroying , in cold blood and for reasons having nothing to do with public utility , archaeological monuments whose value to humanity resides not only in their artistic merits and historical interest , but also in the venerability they derive from their association with one of the most ancient religions in the world .  
The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
To do this , we need to address four major objectives : first , consolidate the secure and stable environment that presently exists ; secondly , steer East Timor through the creation of democratic institutions and successful , peaceful elections ; thirdly , put in place the building blocks for the management of public finances and policy-making ; and fourthly , establish the framework for a sustainable and effective Government administration .  
This public meeting is an ideal opportunity for my delegation to pay a warm tribute to the Special Representative , all the staff of UNTAET and all the Members of the East Timor Transitional Administration for the steps they have taken in the political process leading to the national and international sovereignty of East Timor and the emergence of an independent East Timorese Government .  
As concerns the economic dimension , we fully endorse the priorities set by the Special Representative to hand over a balanced budget to the provisional self-government , to introduce modern financial management and to develop a Kosovo-wide public investment programme within the framework of the Kosovo consolidated budget .  
The Security Council , having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 11 October 2001 ( S / 2001 / 963 ) and having held a public meeting on 19 October 2001 ( S / PV . 4392 and S / PV . 4392 resumption 1 ) , reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia , consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and bearing in mind its respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity , political independence and unity of Somalia .  
Recommendations emanating from the Workshop are expected to focus on future needs for the regulation of space traffic , Earth-threatening asteroids and comets , global navigation satellite systems , space and the public and on the contribution of space systems to the implementation and verification of international environmental agreements .  
Companies participating in the Compact have committed themselves to expressing their support publicly for the Compact and its principles in mission statements , annual reports and public announcements , engaging in dialogue with the United Nations and other partners , sharing concrete examples of progress made or lessons learned in implementing the principles of the Compact and undertaking activities jointly with the United Nations that advance the implementation of those principles or support wider goals such as poverty eradication .

A State may declare at any time that it will not be bound or the extent to which it will not be bound by articles 11 and 12 if the debtor or any person granting a personal or property right securing payment of the assigned receivable is located in that State at the time of the conclusion of the original contract and is a Government , central or local , any subdivision thereof , or an entity constituted for a public purpose .  
Designed to develop and strengthen their public policy , advocacy and lobbying skills , the hands-on , innovative training programme combined theoretical learning and practical experience focusing on the interaction of the legislative , judicial and executive branches of government with the public and private sectors to create public policy .  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
To ensure true respect for freedom of the press and equal access of the various political forces to the public and private media , whether written or audio-visual , under a regulatory system that is in line with democratic principles ;  
The Nadi Framework is based on the premise that possession and use of firearms , ammunition , other related materials and prohibited weapons is a privilege conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety and that public safety will be enhanced by imposing strict controls on the import , possession and use of firearms , ammunition , other related materials and prohibited weapons .  
The policy of civil harmony , introduced by the President of the Republic and clearly ratified by popular referendum , the goodwill and clemency measures , and the unusual openness in the political arena and among the communications media reflected the determination of the Algerian people and of the public authorities to continue to strengthen the democratic process , creating a genuine culture of human rights and a more just society , without fear or arbitrariness .  
A high-level council for human rights had been established , with links to international organizations and local non-governmental organizations , and efforts were being made to involve the people in public life , especially through the establishment of non-governmental organizations in the human rights field dealing with political , social and economic questions .  
The public authorities guaranteed the effective implementation of human rights , and all detected abuses had received the judicial and administrative attention required by law .  
The Government of Iraq , in its response to the Special Rapporteurs interim report to the General Assembly , stated that the death sentence was a punishment only for the most serious crimes and that measures against those charged which such crimes were taken only after proper , fair and public trials by independent and competent courts and in accordance with the law in force ( A / C . 3 / 55 / 5 , annex ) .  
Accordingly , the European Union had decided to support the reforms undertaken in UNIDO since the adoption of the Business Plan at the 1997 General Conference , involving , inter alia , implementation of integrated programmes in the beneficiary countries , strengthening its field offices , and the coordination effort undertaken to enhance cohesion between United Nations agencies as well as coherent action at local level by public and private agents involved in joint projects .  
In conclusion , she expressed satisfaction about the increased convergence amongst different development actors in the private and public sectors , and stated that this was a highly desirable starting point in efforts to improve the situation of the LDCs in the coming decade .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking .  
His delegation wished to emphasize the importance of intensifying international cooperation with a view to implementing the Vienna Declaration , which set out recommendations in the following areas : protecting the environment and managing natural resources , using space applications for human security , development and welfare , advancing scientific knowledge of space and protecting the space environment , enhancing education and training opportunities and ensuring public awareness of the importance of space activities .  
This inadmissible claim highly simplifies a complex historical and social matter ; it ignores the military and financial autonomy of the paramilitaries and the extremely clear and increasing instances of lethal acts of aggression against public servants .

The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  10 .  Adoption of the report of the Commission on its fifth session .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
Many delegations called for increased international cooperation in financial and technology assistance in building capacity , education , training and raising public awareness , particularly in systematic observations of the Earths atmosphere and of the oceans and the land surface , including satellite data .  
It was generally agreed that the development of new information and communication technologies and the emergence of a new knowledge economy offer vast potential for more effective , wider and faster collection and dissemination of information , including for public participation .  The Internet , in particular , can open up new opportunities , such as providing access to a wide range of previously inaccessible environmental databases .  
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Also reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
An international observatory should be established to monitor racially discriminatory attitudes and acts , individual or collective , private or public , including by non-State actors , charged with the following tasks :  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking ;  
Even after signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement , the Ethiopian hordes had wilfully , wantonly and methodically launched indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets , taken prisoners , tortured , raped and murdered , attacked and destroyed villages , public facilities , cultural and religious infrastructures and institutions and engaged in ethnic cleansing , causing large numbers of persons to become displaced .  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Stresses however its deep concern about the continued repression of members of the political opposition and about the detention of dissidents and all other persons detained or imprisoned for peacefully expressing their political , religious and social views and for exercising their right to full and equal participation in public affairs , and calls upon the Government of Cuba to release all those persons ;  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures , including legal and judicial measures in order to bring an end to impunity , to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country , directly or through freely chosen representatives , and to have equal access to public service , without discrimination of any kind as to race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
An integrated approach to development , including consistency in policy-making , drawing upon synergies of different policy areas and comparative advantages of different actors , leading to an effective mobilization of financing for development from both public and private sources , is crucial for achieving the international development targets .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
The role of the private sector in the implementation of the UNFF plan of action could be twofold : first , as an important implementing agent of specific IPF / IFF proposals for action that are specifically addressed to the private sector ; and second , as a crucial financing source to complement national and international public funds .  
However , IFF recognized that private sector investment should not be considered a substitute for international public funding , including ODA . 11 In addition , the IPF / IFF process recognized the important , but differentiated , contributions of the public and private sectors , while stressing the role of Governments in fostering an enabling policy environment . 
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Also encourages Governments , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , international agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide judges , lawyers , political and other public officials , community leaders and other concerned persons , as appropriate , with information and human rights education concerning womens equal ownership of , access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing ;  
That delegation was of the view that sufficient advance information about the scheduled re-entry should be provided to those States in the area of the anticipated descent so that adequate precautionary measures could be taken and also that public anxiety could be alleviated .  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
How can the international community support national efforts to tap civil society and private sector resources to contribute to the provision of infrastructure and social services , so that public resources can be concentrated in other areas where there can be no substitute for government activity ?  
How to encourage all relevant national , regional and international policy-making forums to further pursue efforts to become more accountable , responsive and transparent to public concerns , as well as to review their composition and consultation mechanisms so as to ensure fuller and deeper participation of developing countries and adequate consultation with all concerned actor and stakeholder groups ?  
Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Request States to make a serious commitment to adopting more appropriate measures to ( a ) combat illegal acts motivated by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance against individuals , communities or groups of persons ; ( b ) protect victims of discrimination and provide them with security against future threats ; ( c ) punish those responsible for such crimes and violations of human rights ; and ( d ) make every effort to ensure that national and local public authorities act accordingly ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
The overall objective of improving public sector performance for the delivery of services in LDCs can only be accomplished through the creation of an enabling environment which will ensure effective resource utilization and partnership-building , promote effective society - wide participation and sustain the rule-of-law and equitable distribution of wealth .  
In addition , public sector performance also depends on ( i ) appropriate sectoral policies in key social areas such as health and education ; ( ii ) productive capacity enhancement , depending on a vibrant financial sector ; and ( iii ) the streamlining of legal and regulatory frameworks .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
We request you to intervene and to designate a time and place for the handover of this property without reference to the mechanisms established by Security Council resolution 1284 ( 1999 ) , whose true objective , as has now become clear one and a half years after its adoption , is to deceive world public opinion , to impose a long series of conditions on the lifting of the unjust embargo being maintained against Iraq and to rewrite the previous Security Council resolutions in a tendentious and unlawful manner .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
Governments , with the assistance of relevant United Nations entities , needed to adopt a long-term , timely , coherent and integrated AIDS prevention policy , with public information , life skills-based education programmes specifically tailored to the needs of women and girls , adapted to their social cultural context and sensitivities and the specific needs in their life cycle .  
I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
In order to promote informed decision-making by central , regional or local authorities in proceedings concerning accidental pollution of transboundary inland waters , countries should facilitate participation of the public likely to be affected in hearings and preliminary inquiries and the making of objections in respect of proposed decisions , as well as recourse to and standing in administrative and judicial proceedings .  
The international community , during the course of last year and still in the year 2001 , witnessed how the Pakistan military junta played host to public mass gatherings of terrorist networks of the region and the extremist religious groups of Pakistan on its soil , who clearly and explicitly proclaimed their agenda and expressed intentions for expanding their realm of influence in the region through setting up extremist and radical regimes in countries of the region .  
Aliens shall be equal before the courts and tribunals , and shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of any criminal charge or of rights and obligations in a suit at law .  
Participants considered that the limited space available for indigenous peoples in the media should be used to inform the general public and indigenous communities about what was happening on an international and national level regarding indigenous issues and to create understanding and awareness of indigenous cultures among the general public .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
These include the allocation of revenues from taxes collected in Kosovo to minority communities through the community committees at the municipal level ; the implementation of employment-generating projects in these communities ; improved public services and utilities ; the integration of the 24 local community offices as part of the local administration structure to ensure equal access to public services ; and provision of more educational and health facilities as well as social welfare benefits .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .  
For their part , most LDCs have pursued economic reform programmes set out in the previous Programmes of Action , including eliminating or substantially reducing tariffs and other trade barriers , liberalizing currency regimes , privatizing public enterprises , establishing and strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks and adopting liberal investment policies .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
With the highest rates of infection occurring in the age group of those between 24 and 54 years old , the productive capacity of the country is being diminished simultaneously with greater demands on our meagre financial resources , both private and public , for increased spending on care and facilities for the victims and to mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the disease .  
Acknowledging that non-discriminatory legislation and protective laws create a supportive legal and political environment for the success of public health development and national HIV / AIDS prevention efforts , the Latvian Government revised and adopted an adequate legislative infrastructure .  
By 2003 , establish national prevention targets , recognizing and addressing factors leading to the spread of the epidemic and increasing peoples vulnerability , to reduce HIV incidence for those identifiable groups , within particular local contexts , which currently have high or increasing rates of HIV infection , or which available public health information indicates are at the highest risk for new infection ;  
Protecting public health and nutrition , protecting the environment , encouraging technology transfer , advancing socio-economic development as stated in article 7 of the TRIPS Agreement , and promoting fairness and international cooperation are measures that - at least in theory - are conducive to the promotion and protection of human rights and the balance sought under article 15 .  
Under the CDI Americas initiative , the Inter-American Development Bank is committed to establishing partnerships with international , national and local public and private organizations according to the specific needs of the countries .  
We note with regret that certain media circles , by promoting false images , particularly of migrant workers and refugees , have contributed to the spread of xenophobic sentiments among the public and have encouraged violence by racist groups ; 96 .  We recognize the positive contribution the exercise of the right to freedom of expression ,  
We reaffirm that the stigmatization of people of different origins by acts or omissions of public authorities , institutions , the media , political parties or national or local organizations is not only an act of racial discrimination but also an incitement to the recurrence of such acts , thereby resulting in the creation of a vicious circle which reinforces racist attitudes and prejudices ; such acts should be declared offences and crimes punishable by law ;  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Urges States [ to adopt and implement , or strengthen wherever necessary , national legislation and administrative measures that expressly and specifically counter racism and prohibit racial discrimination , whether direct or indirect , in all spheres of public life in conformity with the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination without making limiting reservations and to review existing measures with a view to amending or revising national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
Calls upon Calls uponStrongly recommends to participating States to introduce , or encourage the introduction of , or reinforce , human rights education , including promoting anti-racism , with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding , tolerance and friendship between different racial or ethnic groups in school curricula and in institutions of higher education and to support public formal and non-formal education programmes designed to promote cultural diversity and self-esteem of vulnerable groups ;  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals . 
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Also , the WHO Healthy Cities Programme aims to put health on the agenda of decision makers , build a strong lobby for public health , and develop holistic , popular , participatory approaches to dealing with health issues , bringing together all the development sectors in a strategic alliance in actions that can lead to a health transformation in creating healthy conditions in various physical environments .  
Also urges States to protect the privacy of those subject to genetic testing and to ensure that genetic testing is done with the prior , free , informed and express consent of the individual or authorization obtained in the manner prescribed by law and in accordance with public international law and the international law of human rights ;  
The enabling environments component of the framework focuses on government actions , such as fair trade policies , removal of technical , legal and administrative barriers to technology transfer , sound economic policy , regulatory frameworks and transparency , all of which create an environment conducive to private and public sector technology transfer .  
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
The Council also held the fourth special high-level meeting with the Bretton Woods institutions on two themes : development financing , in particular poverty eradication , ODA and debt ; and a move forward to a development-friendly international financial system : public and private responsibility in the prevention of financial crisis .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
To ensure that public resources have an impact on the living conditions of the target population , studies are being conducted in connection with the third phase of the integrated financial administration system ( Sistema Integrado de Administracin Financiera SIAF ) , which is responsible for preparing and executing the national budget .  The aim is to incorporate decentralized , autonomous and local entities into the system so as to enhance effectiveness and guarantee transparency in public administration .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Poor management of finances and public corporations has not been conducive to the creation of a favourable macroeconomic and institutional environment for stimulating the economic and social activities of households and enterprises .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
The main characteristic of the period under review has been the large number of complaints of threats , harassment and intimidation against persons and institutions working for the protection of human rights , civil servants , persons involved in judicial proceedings and journalists critical of public authorities .  
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .  
As regards physical infrastructure , development partners committed to supporting infrastructure development , both through public investment and by facilitating private investment , and particularly for the creation of essential infrastructure to facilitate the functioning of liberalized domestic and regional markets .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .

Stressing that , in accordance with article 27 , paragraph 2 , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) , of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the right to protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific , literary or artistic production of which one is the author is a human right , subject to limitations in the public interest ,  
Given the typically sudden character of natural disasters , and of the often total disruption of public telecommunication networks resulting from their impact , the provision of reliable , independent telecommunications links is a prerequisite for efficient assessment of damages , mobilization of resources , coordination of operations and acquisition of information for dissemination through information systems , such as ReliefWeb .  
Educational modules on international migration and development have been produced and included in social studies courses in elementary and secondary schools ; educational specialists have been trained in the application of the modules in public schools .  
Any future international information security regime should provide for a harmonized ban on the collection , storage , use or dissemination of information about a persons private life without his or her agreement and on restrictions to public access to information , except where sanctioned in law .  The globalization of the information area has blurred the traditional concepts of geographical , State and administrative boundaries or areas of jurisdiction that normally delimit national security .  
Everyone is aware of the critical role of the mass media in shaping public opinion on any question , be it domestic or international , and of its major responsibility to observe impartiality and complete objectivity in covering events such as those that took place in the United States recently .  
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
First , as the public sector retreats from commercial services , allowing the private sector to take the leading role , the public sector is assuming the role of regulator to ensure fair competition among service providers , protecting the consumer against monopoly abuse and enforcing quality and safety standards to protect the consumer .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established . 
The expected American military action on Afghanistan , backed by the support of the allied States , was launched on the seventh of this month as a response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last month , which shook the whole world with the heavy losses of the lives of innocent people , and the extensive destruction of a number of public and private properties it caused in the United States of America . 
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .

The public expenditure level set under the national budget must ensure that the social and economic sectors are adequately financed , taking into account the absorptive and fiscal capacity of the economy over the medium term .  
The complexity of managing East Timors public finances is compounded by the need to obtain donor support for the two primary trust funds ( the first funds the national budget , and the second supports capital investment and recovery ) , while coordinating other bilateral and multilateral development assistance .  
The primary strategic objective of the Missions public information programme is to project , country-wide , the efforts of the military and civilian components of UNAMSIL in facilitating the peace process in Sierra Leone and the promotion of a better understanding of the mandate of the Mission and the activities of other international organizations that are operating in the country .

Given the deepening interdependence arising from globalization , holistic and participatory solutions should be sought and partnerships among the major stakeholders , donors , recipients and the public and private sector should be strengthened , in line with the initiative of the Secretary-General on the Global Compact .  
Institutional mechanisms should be established to coordinate the activities of the public authorities responsible for issuing approvals , licences , permits or authorizations required for the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects in accordance with statutory or regulatory provisions on the construction and operation of infrastructure facilities of the type concerned .  
In addition to these personal aids , the State also runs a scheme of building aids , which are intended for public contractors ( such as the low cost housing fund , the national society for low cost housing and the communes ) or private contractors ( such as non-profit making companies contributing to broader subsidized housing programmes ) .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
Affirm that effective and meaningful public participation of civil society , including international and national non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is an essential component of successful and sustainable social and economic development and an important element for the promotion of human rights ;  
A State may declare at any time that it will not be bound or the extent to which it will not be bound by articles 9 and 10 if the debtor or any person granting a personal or property right securing payment of the assigned receivable is located in that State at the time of conclusion of the original contract and is a Government , central or local , any subdivision thereof , or an entity constituted for a public purpose .  
Within the United Nations Development Assistance Framework , the programme contributes to broader national efforts to reduce geographical disparities in major social indicators ; introduce reforms designed to improve the quality and responsiveness of health and education services ; and create and sustain public and political concern for childrens and womens rights .  
The future convention should deal with the active and passive corruption of national and foreign public officials and provide for the liability of natural and legal persons .  
Technical assistance , like any other financial assistance , should concentrate on improving local , regional and national judicial systems and national bodies to monitor money-laundering and on establishing independent national entities to safeguard integrity in public management .

While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
It could also include development of codes of conduct or ethics , an effective and impartial civil service , effective systems for financing political parties , establishment of independent oversight bodies , free and transparent media , transparent public procurement rules , effective regulation of financial systems , an independent judiciary and the effective implementation of the rule of law .
