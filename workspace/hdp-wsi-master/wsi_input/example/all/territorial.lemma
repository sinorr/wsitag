All the membership states of the United Nations should abide by the aims and principles of the " Charter of the United Nations " as well as those relevant UN resolutions to follow those norms governing international relations like mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and so on and refrain from supporting Taiwan by whatever patterns to join the United Nations as well as other international organizations which can only by joined by sovereignty states .  
If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
The course of cross-strait relations in the last five years proves again that it will be only by acting in line with the " one China , two countries " principle , holding cross-strait political talks , to end the hostile cross-strait state as soon as possible , that will really end over a century of Chinese humiliation and territorial division by the great powers , and really achieve China 's complete reunification and a real renaissance of the Chinese nation , to achieve the longstanding dream of the Chinese people to become a strong country .  
The cultural pride and ethnic self-respect that have been formed within the Chinese nation over the five-thousand-year history of its ancient civilization is a sure guarantee that the Chinese people , having " stood up , " and carrying on in the glorious tradition of patriotism , will uphold the principles of national unification and territorial completion more than any other sacred mission .  
We are convinced that the Taiwan compatriots will make their correct choice on this major issue of right and wrong concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country , the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation , and the future and destiny of the Taiwan compatriots .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
However , from the Syrian perspective , whether or not the future border between the two countries is able to be drawn according to the pre-1967 Six Day War actual line of control has a vital bearing on their national dignity and territorial integrity , as well as whether or not they can solve the significant fundamental problems with the half-century old continued Arab Israeli conflict .  
However , we are principled on developing Sino-US relations ; that is , we should strictly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations , especially the principle of mutual respect of each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
Meanwhile , some national and religious conflicts and some problems left over by history have yet been solved ; the conflicts over territorial land , territorial seas , and natural resources have risen one after another ; and some countries have even attempted to bring in foreign forces to take a hand in the interference in others ' internal affairs .  
We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .  
Replacing an old regime by a new one while the main body of international laws remained unchanged , China 's sovereignty and original territorial borders did not change either .  It is therefore logical and natural that the PRC fully owns and exercises China 's sovereignty rights , including the sovereignty right over Taiwan . At the same time , Taiwan 's Kuomintang authorities no longer have any right to represent China in exercising the right of national sovereignty .  
She is not an isolated individual .  She is the candidate chosen by the DPP and a political figure who is about to step up to the front stage in Taiwan . Hence , the remarks on splitting the motherland which she has spread through the media , are yet another political incident , following Lee Teng-hui 's two-state theory , that has seriously provoked China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
It is absurd , because it regards a local government within a country of sovereignty and territorial integrity as an " independent state . "  This is nothing short of challenging and illegally plundering the fundamental interests of all the people of the country .  
Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
Ethnic conflicts , territorial disputes , and war have been continuous in the Mideast over many years , with the result that countless people have been plunged into an abyss of misery and so many families have become destitute and homeless in all the countries of the region ; this has had a serious impact on regional economic and social development and also on world peace and stability .  
The principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , persistence in settling international disputes through peaceful means , equality of sovereignty for all countries , respect for the national condition of every country , seeking harmony while reserving differences , and stepping up mutually beneficial cooperation for common development should be continually reiterated , efforts should be made to practice them , and they should be acted on by all countries .  
In particular , we should closely integrate our plans for protecting certain extremely important economic targets with our national territorial air defense plans , our regional air defense plans , and our urban defense plans ; should give full scope to the might of our air defense arms system ; and should intercept or annihilate the air raid arms of the enemy so as to reduce the pressure on our passive defense and ensure the safety or enhance the survival capability of our vital economic targets .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .  In the future , we will continue to work hard with the new administration in the United States to actively advance bilateral relations to make new improvements and new progress , based on the principles of the three Sino-U.S . aftertime , especially mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in one another 's internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit .  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
Cai stated : Over the past half a century and more , " The UN Charter , " the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , " The Declaration on International Law , " and some other principles of the international law have played a positive and crucial role in preventing a war ; safeguarding peace ; guaranteeing sovereignty and territorial integrity , guarding against foreign intervention , and in other aspects as well .  
Cai stated : The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , namely , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , have formed the core of the international law in modern times .  
After the collision incident , the US surveillance plane intruded China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , and this was a move that further violated the regulations set forth by international and Chinese law , thus constituting a gross encroachment upon China 's sovereignty and territorial airspace .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
According to the relevant stipulations of the 1982 " UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , " exclusive economic zones are neither territorial waters nor international waters , and they themselves have formed a category of regions with a special legal regime .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
It is a serious violation of the international law that the US military reconnaissance plane conducted military reconnaissance activities in the airspace above China 's exclusive economic zone , bombed into and destroyed China 's military plane that was carrying out the regular surveillance task , intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and infringed on China 's territorial sovereignty .  
If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
Jiang Zemin said : China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace .  Its basic objective is one of safeguarding the country 's sovereign independence , territorial integrity , and national dignity , as well as one of opposing hegemonism , safeguarding world peace , promoting common development , and building an international environment of long-term peace and stability for China 's reforms , opening up and modernization drive .  
Commenting on the issue of building a new international political and economic order , Jiang Zemin pointed out : The new international political and economic order should be built on the basis of the Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence - - mutual respect for each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other internal affairs , equality and reciprocity , and peaceful coexistence - - and other universally acknowledged norms governing international relations .  
Zhang Ming , commander of this unit , said when interviewed by our reporter : " We feel very proud of Wang Wei , this fine comrade-in-arms ; Wang Wei is the hero in our mind and the model for us to emulate ; we will turn righteous anger into strength , faithfully carry out our duties , study assiduously , train hard in the skills for killing the enemy , show no fear in the face of strong enemies , and defend the motherland 's dignity and territorial integrity with practical action . "  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
He said the US plane intruded into China 's territorial airspace and encroached upon China 's sovereignty in violation of international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China , as well as the consensus that China and the US reached last May on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities .  Its act has thus constituted a threat to China 's national security .  
He reiterated that the development of Sino-US relations must be built on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms governing international relations such as mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
The spokesman said : In accordance with international law and China 's relevant law , the Chinese side absolutely has the right to carry out an overall investigation on the foreign military reconnaissance plane that damaged the Chinese plane , illegally intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and landed at China 's airport .  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
The act of the US plane violated international law and provisions of relevant Chinese laws , jeopardized the consensus on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities reached between China and the United States in May last year , infringed on China 's territorial airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
These provisions indicate that " other rights " of a coastal country over its exclusive economic zone include its sovereignty and territorial integrity being free from violation as well as its right to protect its national security and peace and other rights granted by international law .  
During peacetime , such military activities conducted by the United States have the obvious characteristic of being hostile to China . They are a threat to China 's national security and peace and order , and a provocation against China 's sovereignty .  They violate a basic principle of international law , which says that countries should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
The Chinese side absolutely could have taken necessary coercive measures in accordance with the right for self-protection stipulated in international law against such a foreign military plane that illegally entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airfield inside a military prohibited zone in China .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
The decree urges all officers and men throughout the military to rally still more closely around the party central committee , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , consciously study and practice the requirements of the " three represents , " work in a down-to-earth manner , wage unremitting struggles , step up preparations for military struggles , and constantly raise our military 's defense and combat capabilities under modern conditions , thereby making even greater contributions toward realizing reunification of the motherland and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
He died a heroic death to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  He loved the party , loved our Army , loved his work as a pilot , worked hard and practiced diligently .  He was an outstanding pilot with high political quality and professional proficiency .  
In Wang Wei 's home , there is an unfinished oil painting : A future Chinese Navy air force pilot flies a fighting eagle fighter plane and soars into the blue sky of the motherland while a warship of a new model cleaves a boundless expanse of blue water and cruises in the territorial waters of the motherland . . .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
The editorial emphasized that with the question of the US surveillance plane crashing with the Chinese warplane and violating China 's territorial integrity still unsolved , the United States is creating further troubles before the ones before have been resolved in deciding to sell arms to Taiwan , saying that this is not conducive to the development of Sino-US relations .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Sino-US ties will move along a normal track so long as both sides abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and such basic norms governing international ties on mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , and noninterference in each other 's internal affairs .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .  
Zhang Qiyue pointed out : The normalization of Sino-Macedonian relations has once again demonstrated that China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity is inalienable .  The Chinese Government 's one-China principled stand has gained the understanding and support from vast majorities of nations and the international community .  Any attempt and practice to split China will work to no avail .  
The two governments agreed to develop bilateral relations of friendly cooperation on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-intervention in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  They also agreed that while maintaining good political relations , efforts would be made to actively open up exchanges and cooperation in other fields , especially in economy and trade .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .  
In his speech , General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's remarks on the Taiwan issue fully expressed the firm determination of the whole party and the entire Chinese people at home and abroad to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and their strong desire to accomplish the motherland 's complete reunification .  
Analyzing the issue in the context of international strategy , how could the United States guarantee that the reconnaissance plane with sophisticated equipment would not take pictures of important military facilities along the coast and carry out " legal espionage mission " once it was permitted to cross China 's territorial airspace ?  Moreover , without regard to China 's strong objection , the United States had resumed its spying mission in the air space of South China and said that it would continue to do so .  
You have been staunchly struggling against Western hostile forces and nationalistic separatist elements and winning major victories in quelling rebellious forces , suppressing bandits , and fighting back against the enemies in defending ourselves , thus effectively maintaining Tibet 's social stability and stability in Tibet 's border areas , and defending national sovereignty , territorial integrity , and ethnic unity .  You have been endeavoring to fulfill the fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people ;  
The treaty lays down that the principles of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit , are the basic norms for the long-lasting and comprehensive development of the good neighborly friendship and cooperation and the strategic cooperation partnership of equality and mutual trust between the two countries .  
First of all , with regard to the " theory of the China threat " spread by certain people in the international and domestic arenas , the two parties stated that they have no territorial demands on each other and they will act in accordance with the principle of international law that territory and national borders are inviolable , strictly observe the national border between them , and build this border into a border of everlasting peace and friendship for all generations .  
Jiang Zemin said : China has always paid great attention to developing relations with Belarus and respected the choice Belarus made on its development approach and its internal and foreign policy .  China supports the efforts of Belarus to oppose any foreign interference and to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Lukashenko said Belarus and China take the same stand on major international issues , including the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order .  Both sides call for adhering to the principles of sovereignty , equality , territorial integrity , noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries , and other basic principles governing international relations .  Both sides also persistently safeguard the security structure and stability of the world today and are opposed to undermining the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty . "  
You have always maintained the true political qualities of being loyal to the party , to the country , to the people and to socialism .  You have resolutely waged struggles against western hostile forces and the national splittists , won great victories in suppressing rebels and bandits and in the self-defense counterattack , forcefully maintained border and social stability in Tibet , and defended our state sovereignty , territorial integrity and national unity .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
Lianyungang and other localities have brought into full play the role of high-tech facilities of military bases in the field of coastal defense surveillance and have built and improved a multilevel surveillance and intelligence network for the sea and coastal regions ( including islands ) .  This has enhanced the coastal defense monitoring capability in ocean and territorial airspace , not merely restricted to coastal beaches , thus solving the difficult problem in coastal defense management .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
It is entirely in the fundamental interest of the people of Taiwan and the fundamental interest of the Chinese nation for the government and people of China to refuse to commit themselves to renouncing the use of force ; only by achieving the complete unification of China will it be possible to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and for the Chinese nation to become even more thriving , developed , prosperous , rich , and powerful . 
It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
In many countries , students are required to receive patriotic education , sing national anthems , and attend flag-raising ceremonies .  When they are grown up and become journalists , they will keenly realize that it is journalists ' duty to safeguard national dignity , national reunification , and territorial integrity .  With professional integrity , they will not use so-called " press freedom " to preach separatism or let separatist remarks occupy a sizable chunk of broadcast time or pages .  
It was reported that in meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in Ankara , President Jiang Zemin expressed that both China and Turkey are faced with the task of protecting national unity and territorial integrity and both oppose all kinds of international terrorism , national separatism and religious extremism .  
He noted : The one-China principle involves China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and involves the fundamental interests and dignity of the Chinese nation ; and since it is the most precious asset that the people on both sides of the strait have left to their future generations through shedding blood and engaging themselves in hard struggles , the one-China principle enjoys a sacred and inviolable position .

It is in the course of developing normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries and in its struggle aimed at safeguarding China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that the Chinese Government has adhered to the One China principle and has won both understanding and support from a growing number of countries and international organizations .  
The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations in mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
At present Sino-US relations are facing new opportunities .  The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
Qian Qichen pointed out : During our talks with Albright , we stressed that whether Sino-US relations can be improved and developed and whether China and the United States can establish their constructive strategic partnership is determined by whether the United States follows the basic norms governing the international law of respecting other countries ' state sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrains from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs and truly sticks to the " one China " principle in its acts .  
6 .  All sides indicate they will resolutely uphold the purpose and principles of the UN Charter ; restate the legitimate rights of all countries to choose their own paths of political , economic , and social development according to their national conditions ; oppose intervention in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretexts of " humanitarianism " and " protecting human rights ; " and support the efforts of one another in safeguarding the five countries ' national independence , sovereignty , territorial integrity , and social stability .  
While re-stressing the standpoints and viewpoints of the Chinese side , Chairman Li Peng emphasized that on the basis of safeguarding the basic norms of international relations China respects the independence , sovereignty , and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan , support the relevant resolutions of the United Nations regarding the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh and does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a sovereign state nor the so-called " parliamentary election " held in this area .  
Third , the two countries shared common historical experiences .  China and Burma have constantly shown sympathy for and supported each other in their efforts for independence and liberation , safeguarding of national independence and sovereign and territorial integrity , and national construction .  Common national fates have closely linked the two countries together .  
The DPRK and Russia acknowledged that every country has the right to decide its own road to political , economic , and social development .  They opposed interference in other countries ' internal affairs under the pretext of " humanitarianism " and supported each other in their efforts to safeguard their own independence , sovereignty , and territorial integrity .  
The two sides thoroughly exchanged views , focusing on how to maintain the momentum of bilateral multi-tiered exchanges , deepen cooperation in trade and economics , mutually support each other in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity , and enhance coordination and cooperation in international and regional issues ; and they reached a common understanding in many issues .  
He hoped that the two sides would continue maintaining close cooperation ; enhance mutual support in the areas of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ; put forth joint efforts opposing interference from without , promoting the establishment of a just and rational new world political and economic order , and protecting the legitimate rights of developing nations .  
In the white paper on " One-China Principle and Taiwan Issue , " the Chinese Government announced clearly that if a major change of events occurred where Taiwan is alienated from China in whatever name , if foreign forces invade and occupy Taiwan , and if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuses to solve the cross-strait reunification issue peacefully through talks , the Chinese Government will be forced to adopt all possible drastic measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity so as to accomplish China 's great cause of reunification .  
Shen Guofang pointed out that the summit would adopt a final document .

Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .

In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .

Until special procedures about an aerospace object are prepared , the aerospace object flying in the airspace , especially in a certain State 's territorial airspace , is considered as an aircraft and the aerospace object located in outer space is considered as a space object which is subject to space law .  
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law .

The land incursion , sea blockade and air attack by Israel demonstrate once again its utter contempt for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon .

The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the recent cowardly , though savage , attacks against defenceless civilians in Lebanon , and calls on the Security Council to condemn Israel 's recent terrorist acts in Lebanon , which have caused tremendous suffering for a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have for a long time been violated by the Israeli occupation forces .  It is incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt specific measures to deal with Israeli intransigence in its non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
It would be preferable at this first submission stage for the coastal State to present in its package summary A4 maps 14 / indicating the approximate limits of its continental shelf , its territorial sea baselines , the general manner by which the limits were defined and any potential areas of disagreement with other States .  
A further , absolutely premeditated , violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba has now been announced with full publicity , at the precise moment when ICAO is trying to arrive at fair conclusions through a report which we hope will be accurate and comprehensive in documenting the facts and impartial in its analysis .

The acts of provocation and aggression reported above constitute a grave violation of the cease-fire agreement in force between the two countries as well as a blatant attack on Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and flout the principles which govern friendly and good-neighbourly relations between States ; above all , they offer clear proof that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is persisting in its determination to pursue a policy that runs counter to the aforementioned principles and does not seek to ensure stability and security in the region .  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
The attitude and statements of the United States set a grave precedent in the history of international relations and run counter to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , Article 2 , paragraph 4 , of which reads : " All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations .

In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .

Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
On the subject of Afro-Colombian communities , Act No . 70 of 1993 reaffirmed the political , economic , social , cultural and territorial rights of such groups and protected their lifestyle as a development option based on their own logic and experience , in conditions of equality , equity , autonomy , participation and respect for cultural differences . 
The recent Administrative Decentralization Act provided a mechanism for indigenous and peasant communities to make their needs known to the central Government through local governments ; other legal measures had brought indigenous people into the national social security system and formalized their territorial rights .  
Turning to the subject of the Commission 's long-term programme of work , she said that her delegation attached most importance to the items relating to unilateral acts of States , criteria for the recognition of States , Governments and territorial acquisitions , the law of the environment and the law of the sea , the last-mentioned being an area in which Portugal had shown a strong interest .  Her delegation welcomed the proposal to carry out a preliminary study on the ownership and protection of wrecks beyond the limits of national maritime jurisdiction .  
I refer here to the need to play a more effective role at the international level which means sending a multinational force and ensuring the flow of necessary humanitarian aid to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees on the basis of full respect for the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and to the need for a broad African participation in any multinational force .  
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
While it was neither desirable nor feasible to adopt inflexible procedures for all peacekeeping operations , such operations must be guided strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular , respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs .

When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law . 
" Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
As I left the region , attention was already shifting from the humanitarian crisis to the political situation in Zaire and its potentially turbulent effects on an already fragile and volatile region ; hence the repeated calls by all the African leaders for the absolute need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Zaire . 
It is appropriate , therefore , that at this meeting of the Council the international community is renewing its support for further efforts to bring about continued progress towards lasting peace , economic reconstruction , the strengthening of national institutions , the promotion of human rights and justice and , more importantly , respect for the independence , sovereignty , legal continuity and territorial integrity of a unified Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders . 
While the territorial and maritime frontier dispute between the Republic of Cameroon and the Federal Republic of Nigeria is pending before the International Court of Justice , Nigerian authorities have just put into operation electrification and drinking-water supply projects , which , in spite of protests by Cameroon , they implemented in Abana , a town occupied by Nigerian troops and set up as an administrative unit of the federal Nigerian state of Cross River .  
The Eighth Islamic Summit Conference , held in Tehran last week , inter alia , reaffirmed the commitment of the member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to preserve the legal continuity , unity , territorial integrity and sovereignty of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders and fully supported the establishment of a sovereign , democratic , multi-ethnic and multicultural State of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Member States have an ongoing commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law , which are founded on total and mutual respect for the territorial integrity and political systems of other States and non-interference in their internal affairs ; the non-use of force ; and the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiations .  
Furthermore , in areas inhabited by a considerable number ( one quarter ) of members of an ethnic group , designations and inscriptions of a topographical nature set up by territorial authorities and public agencies must be bilingual .  
The " parliamentary elections " took place as scheduled and were followed by a second round on 7 December , despite numerous calls by the international community for them not to take place until the conclusion of an agreement on the political status of Abkhazia that respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia .  
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence . 
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;

Apart from this lacuna in humanitarian law ( which can be remedied by the application of the doctrine of state responsibility with regard to breaches of jus cogens rules ) , it is apparent that assertive international diplomatic measures are required to ensure that territorial settlements which prohibit forcible transfers of population and the implantation of settlers are respected by the parties to the agreements .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Such provocative actions by the separatist leaders of the Armenians in Nagorny Karabakh , at a time when positive trends are emerging towards a just and decisive resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the granting of broad autonomy to Nagorny Karabakh , once again demonstrate that the separatists , consolidating the results of the aggression committed against Azerbaijan , intend to nullify the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk group of OSCE and thereby to destroy the peacemaking process . 
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
Reiterating that many citizens who took part in the armed rebellion against the Republic of Croatia have sought and been granted Croatian documents , and that they have by this act accepted all the rights and obligations that derive from Croatian citizenship , including respect for and defence of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia , and that they have accepted the Republic of Croatia as their homeland and have expressed the wish to be included in its political , economic and social life , and in that way to contribute to its prosperity ,  
The safeguarding of peace and the promotion of closer and sustained cooperation among Mediterranean countries should enable the enjoyment of complete sovereignty by all the peoples of the region , free and protected by established and accepted territorial borders and adhering to a mutual policy of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of each other .  
It was unfortunate that a few countries refused to acknowledge that the issue had been settled once and for all by resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , and that the General Committee was subjected every year to the same repetitious and wasteful debate on the subject , despite the universally accepted principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State duly recognized as such by the United Nations . 
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .  
Limitations governing the use of the media are defined in article 5 , which prohibits , inter alia , its use to call for usurpation of power , the change by force of the constitutional order , breach of the territorial integrity of the Republic , incitement to national , social , racial and religious intolerance or dissension , to propagate war and aggression , to diffuse pornography , to encroach on the morality , honour and dignity of citizens or to publish materials relating to inquiries that have not been completed .

Inspired by the long historical and close cultural bonds between Turkey and Afghanistan , we stand ready to fulfil our share of the responsibility falling to the international community to assist the Afghan people on the path to reconciliation and to help them preserve Afghanistan 's territorial integrity , sovereignty , independence and national unity .  
During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Through our Madrid joint statement , by which we stand , it has been put to our neighbour to respect the existing overall framework of international law and treaties that has defined our borders and relations and has stood unchallenged for the last 70 years , and to desist from aggressive policies , refrain from territorial claims and submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice any argument it might deem valid concerning the islet of Imia .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
With regard to the defensive use of these devices for the sole purpose of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity , we concur with the views expressed in the ministerial communiqu of the Non-Aligned Movement of 25 September 1997 , which underlined that any negotiations or agreements thereon should take into account the legitimate security concerns of States as well as their legitimate rights under the Charter of the United Nations .  
These obstacles include the difficult legacy of the past , contradictory legislation and regulations , administrative delays due to conflicts of interest , differing conceptions of economic and social development , ineffective consultation with the populations concerned , notably on the use of territorial resources , and finally endemic violence .  
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
It was suggested that the surveys might be focused only on urban areas or on a selected number of representative administrative and territorial units within the national territory of a State for which the most complete and reliable data were available .  
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The High Contacting Parties shall ensure favourable conditions for direct trade and other economic relations and cooperation at the level of administrative and territorial units in accordance with national legislation currently in force , devoting special attention to the development of economic ties between border regions .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable to other States and are permitted by international law .  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of exerting pressure , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The Government has also set in motion the Social Solidarity Network , a strategy that aims at improving the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and initiating large social programmes through joint efforts of State-owned and territorial institutions , non-governmental organizations and the civil society .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation had held its first ministerial meeting in Mauritius in March 1997 and adopted its charter , the basic principles of which were respect for sovereign equality , territorial integrity and political independence , non-interference in internal affairs , peaceful coexistence and mutual advantage .  
Those principles and norms , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , elaborated in a number of international legal instruments and backed by declarations adopted by international conferences , proscribe the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State and the imposition of coercive economic measures as instruments of intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State , without prejudice , however , to the application of preventive or enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
Specific procedural and legal problems include identification of , and communication with , the proper domestic authorities whose consent is required before boarding a foreign ship , the inability to exercise jurisdiction over domestic vessels or nationals outside territorial waters , and the inability to exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels .  
At the same time , the Convention in other parts developed and codified many rules which were generally agreeable or even favourable to the industrialized States also ( e.g . related to the territorial waters or the exclusive economic zones ) .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
By virtue of its inherent right of legitimate individual or collective self-defence , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducting appropriate military and diplomatic action to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , and to make its cause triumphant in the community of nations .  
Unfortunately , owing to the obvious and open obstruction by some Contact Group members , our endeavour did not ultimately produce the desired effects , although the state delegation demonstrated great cooperativeness by demanding a minimum as regards the protection of the national interests , independence , territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . This country has done only what any other sovereign country in the world would have done . 
The five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non _ aggression , non _ interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , and other universally recognized norms governing international relations make up the political foundations underpinning world peace .  
Those remaining are mostly territorial troops engaged in civil duties , such as voluntary public works in agriculture , construction , irrigation , fighting illiteracy , building churches , roads and bridges , helping the social welfare of villagers , etc .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico is firmly convinced that the preferred means of settling a conflict must be dialogue and negotiation , and it therefore calls on all parties to resume , as soon as possible , talks with a view to achieving a stable and lasting peace based on respect for the human rights of all ethnic groups in the region , and on the territorial integrity of States .  
The Rio Group therefore calls on all parties to resume , as soon as possible , talks with a view to achieving a comprehensive and final settlement with a view to re-establishing a stable and lasting peace based on respect for the human rights of all ethnic groups and minorities in the region , and on the territorial integrity of States .  
With regard to the latter suggestion , it was stated that , while the territorial scope of the draft Convention could be determined on the basis of the place where the receivable had arisen , internationality could be defined by reference to place of registration , place of business , place of chief executive office or of habitual residence , in the case of individuals .  
The Constitution prohibits the activity of political , trade union and other organizations aimed at the violent overthrow of the constitutional order , the territorial integrity of FRY , violation of the guaranteed freedoms and rights of man and the citizen , or incitement of national , racial , religious and other intolerance and hatred ( art .  42 ) .  
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to implement a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
While officials elected in 1995 ( mayoral cartels and administrative councils of the communal sections ) were reappointed as interim agents of the executive or simply dismissed and replaced ( as in the case of the Mayor of Port-au-Prince ) , officials elected in 1997 as members of the territorial assemblies continued to enjoy their prerogatives .

The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such violations in northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to pursue a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
These effects also included the extinction ( or substantial reduction ) of their territorial base and undermined their political , economic , juridical , cultural and social order in general , and even their survival as a distinct society .  
It is the obligation of the entire international presence in Kosovo and Metohija to strictly respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija , which implies respect for its political , administrative , legal , economic and monetary system and an unhindered functioning of public services in accordance with all Yugoslav laws and regulations ;  
The aggressor countries have committed clear violations under the terms of international law : acts of aggression , violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Organization of African Unity , violation of basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law , massive violations of fundamental individual rights and violations of provisions of international environmental law .

Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .

In March 1998 , the Prosecutor proclaimed publicly that the territorial and temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal covered any serious violations of international humanitarian law taking place in Kosovo and stated that she was empowered to investigate such crimes .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin , or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance .

The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf , where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured , by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points , defined by coordinates of latitude and longitude .  
Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .

Noting that the territorial Government continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
It further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify these acts of aggression against northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to adopt policies that are entirely at variance with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
The military incursions in northern Iraq violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity and had forced a withdrawal of the central administration from those areas , turning them into a breeding ground for factional infighting and bloody conflict .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism , in all its forms and manifestations , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq on 23 November 1999 that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
Reflecting the fundamental new direction that international relations have recently taken , the Courts subject matter has also dramatically expanded to include a wide variety of issues : maritime boundaries , territorial sovereignty , the use of force , non-interference in the internal affairs of States , diplomatic relations , hostage-taking , the right to asylum , nationality , expropriation of foreign property and rights of passage .  
Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .  
The Committee is concerned that the State party did not take into account the Committees 1993 major concerns and recommendations when it adopted policies at federal , provincial and territorial levels which exacerbated poverty and homelessness among vulnerable groups during a time of strong economic growth and increasing affluence .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
While supporting the principle that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lay with States , his delegation wished to underline in that regard that initiatives aimed at undermining the territorial integrity or political unity of independent and sovereign States must not be encouraged .  
It had consistently maintained that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be carried out in strict compliance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , as stated in the Charter of the United Nations , and on the basis of the traditional fundamental principles of peacekeeping such as the consent of the parties , impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence .  
He stressed the importance of the fundamental principles underlying international negotiations , namely , respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States , refraining from the threat or use of force , the peaceful settlement of international disputes , equal rights , self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of States .  
During the relevant period , United States warplanes engaged in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory acts as dropping heat flares and breaking the sound barrier over Iraqi civilian areas and establishments , and United States naval vessels also engaged in acts of aggression inside and outside Iraqi territorial waters . 
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
The Government of Iraq , condemning in the strongest terms these official actions by the United States , the United Kingdom and Turkey as irresponsible and illegal , requests you to intervene directly with the Governments of these States and to urge them to desist from their persistent interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and to honour the Charter of the United Nations , which affirms respect for the sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity of Member States .  
Our approach is guided by a set of basic principles : the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; the belief that there can be no military solution to the underlying problems of the region ; and the belief that the human and humanitarian rights of all peoples in the conflict must be respected .  
Provision of technical cooperation services , upon request , to countries of the region in connection with public-sector programming ; economic development and local management ; management of public territorial policies ; national public investment systems ; and integrated management of investment projects ; ( ii ) Group training .  
During the relevant period , United States warplanes engaged in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory acts as dropping heat flares and breaking the sound barrier over Iraqi civilian areas and installations , and United States naval vessels also engaged in acts of aggression inside and outside Iraqi territorial waters .  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
The representative of New Zealand indicated that her delegation could accept the inclusion of the right to self-determination in the draft declaration subject to it being consistent with the domestic understanding of the relationship between the Maori and the Crown and with respect for the territorial integrity of democratic States and their constitutional frameworks , where those met current international human rights standards .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
As stated in Canadas response , the policy has economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and it informs extensive government programming at the federal , provincial and territorial levels .  
At the time of the initial sighting , the location of the submarine was verified by a fishermans global positioning system , and its position inside Republic of Korea territorial waters was later confirmed by military positionlocating equipment .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
As my Government remains unwaveringly committed to defending the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of the country , I would like to reaffirm our strong belief in a peaceful political settlement of the conflict and to reiterate our wholehearted support for the pivotal mediating role of the United Nations , aimed at the establishment of a broad-based , multi-ethnic and fully representative Government in Afghanistan . In this context , the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan already last Friday sent identical letters to the Secretary-General and to yourself , Sir .  
The root causes of the armed conflicts in the world today can be found in very complex economic , social , historic and religious issues , as well as in the tribal and territorial problems that are a legacy of colonialism .  
Because countries have different social systems , ideologies , value systems and religious beliefs , it is necessary in international relations to strictly abide by the basic principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other States , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
Last but not least , Iraq must , once and for all , close its painful chapter in relation to Kuwait , by showing full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait and returning its historical and cultural heritage , including Kuwaiti archives , as well as repatriating missing Kuwaiti persons .  This meeting is taking place at a crucial juncture of the important question of Iraq at the United Nations .  
The Security Council , having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 11 October 2001 ( S / 2001 / 963 ) and having held a public meeting on 19 October 2001 ( S / PV . 4392 and S / PV . 4392 resumption 1 ) , reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia , consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and bearing in mind its respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity , political independence and unity of Somalia .  
Mauritanian legislation covers the fundamental rights and duties of persons , nationality , alien residency requirements , electoral regulations and territorial division into constituencies , regulations governing the ownership of property , the general organization of the civil service , economic and social activities of the State and so forth .  
For that reason his delegation had sponsored resolutions on the protection and security of small States in 1989 , 1991 and 1994 and remained convinced that a long-term solution to the problem required , among other things , the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to assist small States in protecting their security , sovereignty and territorial integrity in time of need .  Such assistance should be regarded as a political and moral obligation on the part of the international community .  
The social and cultural impact of territorial fragmentation does not lend itself easily to a summary in numerical terms , but the scenario in that area is no less severe than that depicted in relation to the economic rights data .  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all their forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State ;  
Fully recognize all of the rights of the indigenous peoples in conformity with the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States ; in concert with them the necessary constitutional , administrative , legislative and judicial reforms must be promoted , including those derived from applicable international instruments ;  
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity . 
Such wanton aggression on the part of the United States and the United Kingdom not only constitutes a serious violation of Iraqs sovereignty and territorial integrity and endangers the lives and safety of a large number of innocent civilians but also represents a flagrant and deliberate violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law and a genuine threat to international peace and security created by two countries that are permanent members of the Security Council .  
The new democratic Governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the Republic of Croatia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have each pledged , and begun to act upon , commitments to constructive bilateral and regional relations based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
It reiterated its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for economic and social development .  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
We fully recognize all of the rights of the indigenous peoples , in conformity with the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States , and that , in consultation with indigenous peoples , the necessary constitutional , administrative , legislative and judicial reforms must be promoted , including those derived from applicable international instruments ;  
These are the precise considerations that led to Russias initiative to convene a Balkan summit , with a view to the conclusion , by the States of the region and interested neighbouring countries , of a legally binding agreement that would set out mutual obligations for absolute compliance with the fundamental principles of State relations , the most important of which are the inviolability of borders , sovereign equality , respect for territorial integrity , non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States and the non-use of force . 
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The Ministers expressed their serious concern for the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia in recent months by ethnic Albanian extremist groups , strongly condemning their terrorist acts and armed violence and calling on these groups to stop their actions , to release the hostages , to lay down their weapons and to withdraw immediately from the occupied areas .  
Nevertheless , the United States and the United Kingdom , with logistic support provided by Turkey and with both logistic support and funding provided by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , are persisting undeterred in their contempt for the Charter of the United Nations and international law and are engaging in this cowardly terrorist aggression against Iraqi civilians and against Iraqs sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence .  
All the membership states of the United Nations should abide by the aims and principles of the " Charter of the United Nations " as well as those relevant UN resolutions to follow those norms governing international relations like mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and so on and refrain from supporting Taiwan by whatever patterns to join the United Nations as well as other international organizations which can only by joined by sovereignty states .  
If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country , and if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation , it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for " Taiwan independence " and safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
The course of cross-strait relations in the last five years proves again that it will be only by acting in line with the " one China , two countries " principle , holding cross-strait political talks , to end the hostile cross-strait state as soon as possible , that will really end over a century of Chinese humiliation and territorial division by the great powers , and really achieve China 's complete reunification and a real renaissance of the Chinese nation , to achieve the longstanding dream of the Chinese people to become a strong country .  
The cultural pride and ethnic self-respect that have been formed within the Chinese nation over the five-thousand-year history of its ancient civilization is a sure guarantee that the Chinese people , having " stood up , " and carrying on in the glorious tradition of patriotism , will uphold the principles of national unification and territorial completion more than any other sacred mission .  
We are convinced that the Taiwan compatriots will make their correct choice on this major issue of right and wrong concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country , the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation , and the future and destiny of the Taiwan compatriots .  
However , if a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name , or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , or if the Taiwan authorities refuse , sine die , the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait reunification through negotiations , then the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great cause of reunification .  
However , from the Syrian perspective , whether or not the future border between the two countries is able to be drawn according to the pre-1967 Six Day War actual line of control has a vital bearing on their national dignity and territorial integrity , as well as whether or not they can solve the significant fundamental problems with the half-century old continued Arab Israeli conflict .  
However , we are principled on developing Sino-US relations ; that is , we should strictly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations , especially the principle of mutual respect of each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
Meanwhile , some national and religious conflicts and some problems left over by history have yet been solved ; the conflicts over territorial land , territorial seas , and natural resources have risen one after another ; and some countries have even attempted to bring in foreign forces to take a hand in the interference in others ' internal affairs .  
We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .  
Replacing an old regime by a new one while the main body of international laws remained unchanged , China 's sovereignty and original territorial borders did not change either .  It is therefore logical and natural that the PRC fully owns and exercises China 's sovereignty rights , including the sovereignty right over Taiwan . At the same time , Taiwan 's Kuomintang authorities no longer have any right to represent China in exercising the right of national sovereignty .  
She is not an isolated individual .  She is the candidate chosen by the DPP and a political figure who is about to step up to the front stage in Taiwan . Hence , the remarks on splitting the motherland which she has spread through the media , are yet another political incident , following Lee Teng-hui 's two-state theory , that has seriously provoked China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
It is absurd , because it regards a local government within a country of sovereignty and territorial integrity as an " independent state . "  This is nothing short of challenging and illegally plundering the fundamental interests of all the people of the country .  
Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
Ethnic conflicts , territorial disputes , and war have been continuous in the Mideast over many years , with the result that countless people have been plunged into an abyss of misery and so many families have become destitute and homeless in all the countries of the region ; this has had a serious impact on regional economic and social development and also on world peace and stability .  
The principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , persistence in settling international disputes through peaceful means , equality of sovereignty for all countries , respect for the national condition of every country , seeking harmony while reserving differences , and stepping up mutually beneficial cooperation for common development should be continually reiterated , efforts should be made to practice them , and they should be acted on by all countries .  
In particular , we should closely integrate our plans for protecting certain extremely important economic targets with our national territorial air defense plans , our regional air defense plans , and our urban defense plans ; should give full scope to the might of our air defense arms system ; and should intercept or annihilate the air raid arms of the enemy so as to reduce the pressure on our passive defense and ensure the safety or enhance the survival capability of our vital economic targets .  
Due to their common understanding and support for each other in such matters as safeguarding their state sovereignty and territorial integrity , promoting global peace , and building a new international political and economic order , bilateral relations between China and Ukraine have developed in all fields .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .  In the future , we will continue to work hard with the new administration in the United States to actively advance bilateral relations to make new improvements and new progress , based on the principles of the three Sino-U.S . aftertime , especially mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in one another 's internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit .  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
Cai stated : Over the past half a century and more , " The UN Charter , " the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , " The Declaration on International Law , " and some other principles of the international law have played a positive and crucial role in preventing a war ; safeguarding peace ; guaranteeing sovereignty and territorial integrity , guarding against foreign intervention , and in other aspects as well .  
Cai stated : The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , namely , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , have formed the core of the international law in modern times .  
After the collision incident , the US surveillance plane intruded China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , and this was a move that further violated the regulations set forth by international and Chinese law , thus constituting a gross encroachment upon China 's sovereignty and territorial airspace .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
According to the relevant stipulations of the 1982 " UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , " exclusive economic zones are neither territorial waters nor international waters , and they themselves have formed a category of regions with a special legal regime .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
It is a serious violation of the international law that the US military reconnaissance plane conducted military reconnaissance activities in the airspace above China 's exclusive economic zone , bombed into and destroyed China 's military plane that was carrying out the regular surveillance task , intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and infringed on China 's territorial sovereignty .  
If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
Jiang Zemin said : China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace .  Its basic objective is one of safeguarding the country 's sovereign independence , territorial integrity , and national dignity , as well as one of opposing hegemonism , safeguarding world peace , promoting common development , and building an international environment of long-term peace and stability for China 's reforms , opening up and modernization drive .  
Commenting on the issue of building a new international political and economic order , Jiang Zemin pointed out : The new international political and economic order should be built on the basis of the Five Principles for Peaceful Coexistence - - mutual respect for each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other internal affairs , equality and reciprocity , and peaceful coexistence - - and other universally acknowledged norms governing international relations .  
Zhang Ming , commander of this unit , said when interviewed by our reporter : " We feel very proud of Wang Wei , this fine comrade-in-arms ; Wang Wei is the hero in our mind and the model for us to emulate ; we will turn righteous anger into strength , faithfully carry out our duties , study assiduously , train hard in the skills for killing the enemy , show no fear in the face of strong enemies , and defend the motherland 's dignity and territorial integrity with practical action . "  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
He said the US plane intruded into China 's territorial airspace and encroached upon China 's sovereignty in violation of international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China , as well as the consensus that China and the US reached last May on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities .  Its act has thus constituted a threat to China 's national security .  
He reiterated that the development of Sino-US relations must be built on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms governing international relations such as mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
The spokesman said : In accordance with international law and China 's relevant law , the Chinese side absolutely has the right to carry out an overall investigation on the foreign military reconnaissance plane that damaged the Chinese plane , illegally intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and landed at China 's airport .  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
The act of the US plane violated international law and provisions of relevant Chinese laws , jeopardized the consensus on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities reached between China and the United States in May last year , infringed on China 's territorial airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
These provisions indicate that " other rights " of a coastal country over its exclusive economic zone include its sovereignty and territorial integrity being free from violation as well as its right to protect its national security and peace and other rights granted by international law .  
During peacetime , such military activities conducted by the United States have the obvious characteristic of being hostile to China . They are a threat to China 's national security and peace and order , and a provocation against China 's sovereignty .  They violate a basic principle of international law , which says that countries should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
The Chinese side absolutely could have taken necessary coercive measures in accordance with the right for self-protection stipulated in international law against such a foreign military plane that illegally entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airfield inside a military prohibited zone in China .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
The decree urges all officers and men throughout the military to rally still more closely around the party central committee , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , consciously study and practice the requirements of the " three represents , " work in a down-to-earth manner , wage unremitting struggles , step up preparations for military struggles , and constantly raise our military 's defense and combat capabilities under modern conditions , thereby making even greater contributions toward realizing reunification of the motherland and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
He died a heroic death to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  He loved the party , loved our Army , loved his work as a pilot , worked hard and practiced diligently .  He was an outstanding pilot with high political quality and professional proficiency .  
In Wang Wei 's home , there is an unfinished oil painting : A future Chinese Navy air force pilot flies a fighting eagle fighter plane and soars into the blue sky of the motherland while a warship of a new model cleaves a boundless expanse of blue water and cruises in the territorial waters of the motherland . . .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
The editorial emphasized that with the question of the US surveillance plane crashing with the Chinese warplane and violating China 's territorial integrity still unsolved , the United States is creating further troubles before the ones before have been resolved in deciding to sell arms to Taiwan , saying that this is not conducive to the development of Sino-US relations .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Sino-US ties will move along a normal track so long as both sides abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and such basic norms governing international ties on mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , and noninterference in each other 's internal affairs .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .  
Zhang Qiyue pointed out : The normalization of Sino-Macedonian relations has once again demonstrated that China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity is inalienable .  The Chinese Government 's one-China principled stand has gained the understanding and support from vast majorities of nations and the international community .

Just as Israel has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and free from threats or acts of force , as affirmed by Security Council resolution 242 ( 1967 ) , the territorial integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries should also be strictly respected , in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , including resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
Latin America , born unaware of racial hatred , religious conflicts and territorial greed , with an indivisible spirit made up of a combination of influences that move in the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages , is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are social ones , brought on by the error of political regimes that ignored the discipline of education or doubted its undeniable primacy . 
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
The United Nations will not be strong and effective if it allows cardinal principles of international law , such as respect for sovereignty , the territorial integrity of States and the right of States freely to choose their political , economic and social system , to succumb to unilateral political interests and the imposition of models .  
This is a major responsibility of our territorial sovereignty and brings with it an inheritance of advances in technology , human labour and rapid interocean transportation in sum , the successful development of a valuable resource for worthy joint activities of benefit above all to the people of Panama and in general to all the peoples of the Earth .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .  
Peace should have prevailed in the post-cold-war world , in which equal members of the international community should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrain from invading each other or interfering in each other 's internal affairs , and live in harmony with each other , in a spirit of seeking common ground and putting aside differences .  
KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .  
Responding to questions raised by the Committee with respect to article 1 , she noted that exemptions from the principle of equality were based on objective criteria and precise rules formulated as laws following broad consultations with institutional and other partners .  Their purpose was to permit certain territorial adaptations in the organization of the principles recognized in the Constitution ; the principles themselves could not be changed .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever . 
Until special procedures about an aerospace object are prepared , the aerospace object flying in the airspace , especially in a certain State 's territorial airspace , is considered as an aircraft and the aerospace object located in outer space is considered as a space object which is subject to space law .  
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law . 
On 13 July 1995 , aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " penetrated over Cuban territorial waters north of our capital , entered prohibited zone MU-P1 and overflew over the city at very low altitude , dropping leaflets and behaving in a dangerous and careless manner .  
With full respect for the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of each country , and within the context of juridical arrangements established with other States , coordinate efforts to combat criminal organizations engaged in migrant trafficking .  
The land incursion , sea blockade and air attack by Israel demonstrate once again its utter contempt for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon . By its action , Israel has violated not only the most basic principles governing relations between States , as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , which we all espouse , but also international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions , particularly resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the recent cowardly , though savage , attacks against defenceless civilians in Lebanon , and calls on the Security Council to condemn Israel 's recent terrorist acts in Lebanon , which have caused tremendous suffering for a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have for a long time been violated by the Israeli occupation forces .  It is incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt specific measures to deal with Israeli intransigence in its non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to establish a just and equitable international political and economic order and promote regional and global peace , stability , development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence , as well as of the accepted norms governing international relations .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
It would be preferable at this first submission stage for the coastal State to present in its package summary A4 maps 14 / indicating the approximate limits of its continental shelf , its territorial sea baselines , the general manner by which the limits were defined and any potential areas of disagreement with other States .  
A further , absolutely premeditated , violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba has now been announced with full publicity , at the precise moment when ICAO is trying to arrive at fair conclusions through a report which we hope will be accurate and comprehensive in documenting the facts and impartial in its analysis .  
ANCELL , the representative of the Province of Santa Cruz ( Argentina ) in the National Congress of Argentina and a descendant of the native people of the Malvinas , said that territorial conquests by force had lost their currency and that the Committee had performed an outstanding task in liberating territories and returning them to their rightful owners .  
These incursive and cruel activities which resulted in numerous human casualties and material damages to civilian population constitute a grave violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran .  
It urges you to intervene with the Government of the United States of America with a view to halting and preventing any repetition of hostile acts in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law that are being committed by a State that is a permanent member of the Security Council against another Member State of the United Nations whose sovereignty , security and territorial integrity are thereby threatened and whose civilian population is thereby left in a state of alarm .  
The acts of provocation and aggression reported above constitute a grave violation of the cease-fire agreement in force between the two countries as well as a blatant attack on Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and flout the principles which govern friendly and good-neighbourly relations between States ; above all , they offer clear proof that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is persisting in its determination to pursue a policy that runs counter to the aforementioned principles and does not seek to ensure stability and security in the region .  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
The attitude and statements of the United States set a grave precedent in the history of international relations and run counter to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , Article 2 , paragraph 4 , of which reads : " All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations . "  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations . [ 1 ] / United Nations , Treaty Series , vol .  520 , No . 7515 .  
Kazakstan calls on the parties to the conflict on all concerned States in the region and on the international community to take urgent measures to halt the military action , ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign Islamic State of Afghanistan and guarantee its territorial integrity .  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
The doctrine shall encompass respect for the Guatemalan Constitution , human rights , the international instruments ratified by Guatemala in the military field , protection of national sovereignty and independence , the territorial integrity of Guatemala and the spirit of the agreements on a firm and lasting peace .

"  [ 1 ] / E / 1996 / 99 .  
Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
On the subject of Afro-Colombian communities , Act No . 70 of 1993 reaffirmed the political , economic , social , cultural and territorial rights of such groups and protected their lifestyle as a development option based on their own logic and experience , in conditions of equality , equity , autonomy , participation and respect for cultural differences . 
The recent Administrative Decentralization Act provided a mechanism for indigenous and peasant communities to make their needs known to the central Government through local governments ; other legal measures had brought indigenous people into the national social security system and formalized their territorial rights .  
Turning to the subject of the Commission 's long-term programme of work , she said that her delegation attached most importance to the items relating to unilateral acts of States , criteria for the recognition of States , Governments and territorial acquisitions , the law of the environment and the law of the sea , the last-mentioned being an area in which Portugal had shown a strong interest .  Her delegation welcomed the proposal to carry out a preliminary study on the ownership and protection of wrecks beyond the limits of national maritime jurisdiction .  
I refer here to the need to play a more effective role at the international level which means sending a multinational force and ensuring the flow of necessary humanitarian aid to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees on the basis of full respect for the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and to the need for a broad African participation in any multinational force .  
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
While it was neither desirable nor feasible to adopt inflexible procedures for all peacekeeping operations , such operations must be guided strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular , respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs .  
" Actions taken in furtherance of this Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .

When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law . 
" Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
As I left the region , attention was already shifting from the humanitarian crisis to the political situation in Zaire and its potentially turbulent effects on an already fragile and volatile region ; hence the repeated calls by all the African leaders for the absolute need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Zaire . 
It is appropriate , therefore , that at this meeting of the Council the international community is renewing its support for further efforts to bring about continued progress towards lasting peace , economic reconstruction , the strengthening of national institutions , the promotion of human rights and justice and , more importantly , respect for the independence , sovereignty , legal continuity and territorial integrity of a unified Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders . 
While the territorial and maritime frontier dispute between the Republic of Cameroon and the Federal Republic of Nigeria is pending before the International Court of Justice , Nigerian authorities have just put into operation electrification and drinking-water supply projects , which , in spite of protests by Cameroon , they implemented in Abana , a town occupied by Nigerian troops and set up as an administrative unit of the federal Nigerian state of Cross River .  
The Eighth Islamic Summit Conference , held in Tehran last week , inter alia , reaffirmed the commitment of the member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to preserve the legal continuity , unity , territorial integrity and sovereignty of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders and fully supported the establishment of a sovereign , democratic , multi-ethnic and multicultural State of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Member States have an ongoing commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law , which are founded on total and mutual respect for the territorial integrity and political systems of other States and non-interference in their internal affairs ; the non-use of force ; and the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiations .  
Furthermore , in areas inhabited by a considerable number ( one quarter ) of members of an ethnic group , designations and inscriptions of a topographical nature set up by territorial authorities and public agencies must be bilingual .  
The " parliamentary elections " took place as scheduled and were followed by a second round on 7 December , despite numerous calls by the international community for them not to take place until the conclusion of an agreement on the political status of Abkhazia that respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia .  
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence . 
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;

Apart from this lacuna in humanitarian law ( which can be remedied by the application of the doctrine of state responsibility with regard to breaches of jus cogens rules ) , it is apparent that assertive international diplomatic measures are required to ensure that territorial settlements which prohibit forcible transfers of population and the implantation of settlers are respected by the parties to the agreements .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Such provocative actions by the separatist leaders of the Armenians in Nagorny Karabakh , at a time when positive trends are emerging towards a just and decisive resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the granting of broad autonomy to Nagorny Karabakh , once again demonstrate that the separatists , consolidating the results of the aggression committed against Azerbaijan , intend to nullify the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk group of OSCE and thereby to destroy the peacemaking process . 
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
Reiterating that many citizens who took part in the armed rebellion against the Republic of Croatia have sought and been granted Croatian documents , and that they have by this act accepted all the rights and obligations that derive from Croatian citizenship , including respect for and defence of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia , and that they have accepted the Republic of Croatia as their homeland and have expressed the wish to be included in its political , economic and social life , and in that way to contribute to its prosperity ,  
The safeguarding of peace and the promotion of closer and sustained cooperation among Mediterranean countries should enable the enjoyment of complete sovereignty by all the peoples of the region , free and protected by established and accepted territorial borders and adhering to a mutual policy of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of each other .  
It was unfortunate that a few countries refused to acknowledge that the issue had been settled once and for all by resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , and that the General Committee was subjected every year to the same repetitious and wasteful debate on the subject , despite the universally accepted principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State duly recognized as such by the United Nations . 
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .  
Limitations governing the use of the media are defined in article 5 , which prohibits , inter alia , its use to call for usurpation of power , the change by force of the constitutional order , breach of the territorial integrity of the Republic , incitement to national , social , racial and religious intolerance or dissension , to propagate war and aggression , to diffuse pornography , to encroach on the morality , honour and dignity of citizens or to publish materials relating to inquiries that have not been completed .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Inspired by the long historical and close cultural bonds between Turkey and Afghanistan , we stand ready to fulfil our share of the responsibility falling to the international community to assist the Afghan people on the path to reconciliation and to help them preserve Afghanistan 's territorial integrity , sovereignty , independence and national unity .  
During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Through our Madrid joint statement , by which we stand , it has been put to our neighbour to respect the existing overall framework of international law and treaties that has defined our borders and relations and has stood unchallenged for the last 70 years , and to desist from aggressive policies , refrain from territorial claims and submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice any argument it might deem valid concerning the islet of Imia .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
With regard to the defensive use of these devices for the sole purpose of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity , we concur with the views expressed in the ministerial communiqu of the Non-Aligned Movement of 25 September 1997 , which underlined that any negotiations or agreements thereon should take into account the legitimate security concerns of States as well as their legitimate rights under the Charter of the United Nations .  
These obstacles include the difficult legacy of the past , contradictory legislation and regulations , administrative delays due to conflicts of interest , differing conceptions of economic and social development , ineffective consultation with the populations concerned , notably on the use of territorial resources , and finally endemic violence .  
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
It was suggested that the surveys might be focused only on urban areas or on a selected number of representative administrative and territorial units within the national territory of a State for which the most complete and reliable data were available .  
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
The High Contacting Parties shall ensure favourable conditions for direct trade and other economic relations and cooperation at the level of administrative and territorial units in accordance with national legislation currently in force , devoting special attention to the development of economic ties between border regions .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable to other States and are permitted by international law .  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of exerting pressure , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .

As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
Reflecting the fundamental new direction that international relations have recently taken , the Courts subject matter has also dramatically expanded to include a wide variety of issues : maritime boundaries , territorial sovereignty , the use of force , non-interference in the internal affairs of States , diplomatic relations , hostage-taking , the right to asylum , nationality , expropriation of foreign property and rights of passage .  
Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .

He stressed the importance of the fundamental principles underlying international negotiations , namely , respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States , refraining from the threat or use of force , the peaceful settlement of international disputes , equal rights , self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of States .  
During the relevant period , United States warplanes engaged in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory acts as dropping heat flares and breaking the sound barrier over Iraqi civilian areas and establishments , and United States naval vessels also engaged in acts of aggression inside and outside Iraqi territorial waters . 
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
The Government of Iraq , condemning in the strongest terms these official actions by the United States , the United Kingdom and Turkey as irresponsible and illegal , requests you to intervene directly with the Governments of these States and to urge them to desist from their persistent interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and to honour the Charter of the United Nations , which affirms respect for the sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity of Member States .

Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
Last but not least , Iraq must , once and for all , close its painful chapter in relation to Kuwait , by showing full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait and returning its historical and cultural heritage , including Kuwaiti archives , as well as repatriating missing Kuwaiti persons .

Such assistance should be regarded as a political and moral obligation on the part of the international community .  
The social and cultural impact of territorial fragmentation does not lend itself easily to a summary in numerical terms , but the scenario in that area is no less severe than that depicted in relation to the economic rights data .  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;

Such wanton aggression on the part of the United States and the United Kingdom not only constitutes a serious violation of Iraqs sovereignty and territorial integrity and endangers the lives and safety of a large number of innocent civilians but also represents a flagrant and deliberate violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law and a genuine threat to international peace and security created by two countries that are permanent members of the Security Council .

We fully recognize all of the rights of the indigenous peoples , in conformity with the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States , and that , in consultation with indigenous peoples , the necessary constitutional , administrative , legislative and judicial reforms must be promoted , including those derived from applicable international instruments ;

Nevertheless , the United States and the United Kingdom , with logistic support provided by Turkey and with both logistic support and funding provided by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , are persisting undeterred in their contempt for the Charter of the United Nations and international law and are engaging in this cowardly terrorist aggression against Iraqi civilians and against Iraqs sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence .
