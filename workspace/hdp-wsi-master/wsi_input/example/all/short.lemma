The construction of Yanshuigou Tunnel started on September 15 last year .  Since Qiulitage is geologically characterized by brittle and weeping rocks and great susceptibility to cave-ins , the project managing department of the 15th Engineering Bureau of China Railway Construction Corp that was contracted to undertake construction adopted technical strategies such low-impact explosion , short length drilling and steel bolstering .  More than 26,000 cubic meters of rock were drilled and cleared before this long distance tunnel 3.9 meters wide at the bottom and 3.6 meters in height was finally completed .  
Not discouraged , Li Bin made use of the supplementary education courses sponsored by the detachment , and learned from the instructors with a receptive mind .  He studied intensively the professional knowledge , and made laborious efforts to finish within a short period of three years the teaching material of 12 courses , including " fundamentals of electrical equipment , " the " study of missile launching , " and others .  
Consumer demand is short for three main reasons : 1 .  Since reform and opening , while the absolute value of the income and consumption level of Chinese residents has been growing steadily , the ratio of our society 's gross product that is eventually used for consumption , or the final consumption rate , has been in a falling trend , with our accumulation or savings rate having tended to rise .  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
Qinghai is rich in petroleum , natural gas , salt , and nonferrous metal deposits , and it has special climatic conditions for the development of special agriculture and animal husbandry .  There are prospects for attaining development in a leaping-forward way [ kua yue shi de fa zhan 6421-6390-1709-4104-4099-1455 ] in a relatively short period of time , provided that we seize the opportunity , accelerate the progress of reform and opening up , enhance our concept of the market , and pay attention to the scientific and technological content in the exploitation and utilization of resources .  
Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
Article 6 A system of controlling the total discharge volume of major pollutants may be instituted for a body of water that still falls short of the water environmental quality standards set by the state even after its water pollutant discharge quotas have been fulfilled .  
The above facts show that Shenzhen has rapidly grown from a small border town to a modern city in a short period of 20 years , an essential factor of which is attributable to our party 's policy decision on the construction of Shenzhen and the creative practice of the vast numbers of cadres and masses that represent the demands of the development of advanced social productive forces .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
It is absurd , because it regards a local government within a country of sovereignty and territorial integrity as an " independent state . "  This is nothing short of challenging and illegally plundering the fundamental interests of all the people of the country .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
Within a very short period of 20 years , Chinese economy made huge progress , the people 's living standards rose to a new height , and the integrated national strength made an enormous step forward .

It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
They should also be introduced if they meet relevant requirements .  In short , capable personnel are the basic conditions for doing any work .  As long as the recruitment of such capable personnel is conducive to the building of national defense and to the modernization of our armed forces , we should strive to recruit them without sticking to one pattern .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
As for the process of handling the incident , Jin Chanrong said , there existed some problems in the foreign policy-making body of the Bush administration .  Although there are some veteran officials with rich experience inside the government , it was hard to find someone who may have a final say and can convince others , or it is possible that the veterans with experience may be short of the ability to handle new problems .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
Some MAC members maintained that the status quo between Washington , Beijing , and Taipei would not go on forever .  They said that Taiwan must come up with short - , medium - and long-term Mainland policies and objectives to deal with the " intermediate agreement " that the US side once mentioned , and the " one country , two systems " formula the Mainland authorities persistently follows.Some other MAC members pointed out that the government has been acting rather passively in approaching current international affairs .  
The trend is still unclear about who will win and who will lose in the cross-strait economic competition over the short , mid - , and long-term periods .  Although the mainland has a superior condition for economic development , Taiwan still has such favorable conditions as being ahead in technology , having the ability to conform , and international competitiveness , and it still has room for development .  
If the government department or organ that is in charge of examining and approving projects approves a project that falls short of the safety requirements prescribed in the law , regulations and rules , its chief responsible person shall be disciplined in the form of demotion , dismissal , or deprived of the right to public office according to the seriousness of the offense .  
With Jiang Shibao 's high-altitude monitoring , Li Mingquan pressed close to this small airplane , made a tight spiral which was close to the ultimate limit , and firmly " netted " the target - - the distance was so short that even the cabin meters of the opposite side could be clearly seen .  
The opponent , who was in a rush for a short moment , was finally forced to land at the seaside - - investigation showed that the pilot of this small airplane was a man who once won the championship in the world super light airplane flying competition and had 25 years of flying experience .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .  
In order to enhance the speed of dismantling and erecting radar without lighting at night , this brigade implemented the personnel positioning and work-sharing responsibility system , made painstaking efforts to practice the skills of dismantling and erecting radar through separate training and group training , attained the goal that the positioning of personnel was accurate and the installation of instruments was in place , and made utmost efforts to withdraw from a position within a short time .  
Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
Under the guidance of the " 17-point agreement , " the people in Tibet drove out the imperialist invading forces , put an end to the state of permanently being backward , sealed off , and stagnant , and made great progress which has attracted worldwide attention in the short period of 50 years .  The economic development , social progress , and remarkable improvement in the living standards of the people are trends of history .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
It is the most preferable to expand the fish pond and raise fish of selected new breeds .  In short , establish and improve good operating mechanisms for training " thousand-mile horses " on the basis of forward-looking thinking and advance designing , so as to change from passively waiting for personnel to proactively training personnel .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , the vast numbers of overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have played an irreplaceable role in enabling China to exchange and cooperate with all countries , introduce large amounts of foreign funds , enter the international market , and sell home-made products to different parts of the world in a very short time .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina Patricio Echegaray , and the Party 's Secretary for International Relations Athos Fava , said in a congratulatory telegram to Jiang Zemin , " The Chinese Communist Party , established 80 years ago by a small number of revolutionaries in the historically famous city of Shanghai , proposed the objective of seizing political power and establishing socialist society .  It seized power within the relatively short span of 28 years .  
The officials and men cooled down after hearing forceful evidences and logical analyses , and reached a common understanding : The base was not harsh , but our training fell short of the requirements of real battles .  
Zhao Leji , a native of Qinghai , has made himself conspicuous within a very short period of time in recent years , and is now the youngest governor in the country .  He is considered to enjoy a promising political future , and there is wide speculation that he will become one of state leaders of the new generation .

With high functional density , short lead time , low costs , and other special features , small satellites are extensively applied to mobile communications , resources exploration , forest conflagrations , flooding , and marine monitoring , and yield social and economic benefits , becoming an important industry for countries with advanced aerospace technology .  
In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Since the May Fourth Movement , the struggles engaged by the Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have always been accompanied by fierce political movements , with passionate mass parades and fervent slogans which are spread nationwide in a short period of time .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
Third , it is anticipated that there will not be substantial changes in commodity prices this year , interest rates will not be adjusted in the near term , and the decision on collecting interest tax is adopted and will not be changed .

It is not strange that a large amount of money suddenly flows into the markets in a short time , because the number of stock traders is growing every day .  
A short time ago , the Legislative Council members of the " democratic factions " proposed a motion to " revise the Basic Law , " demanding that all the members of the Legislative Council be elected through direct voting ahead of schedule , and that the chief executive of the HKSAR be directly elected by way of " one man one vote . "  
Jiang Ying says that : In a short dozen years or so , in the area of patent legislation , examination , and institution building , China has done what took the developed nations decades or even a century to do , to the focus of world attention .  But since " our ability and quality in grasping and using patents remains inadequate , in contrast to the developed nations , we remain subject to a sizeable gap . "

mobilizing all forces in the society ; vigorously strengthening the work of predicting and forecasting earthquakes , especially the work of forecasting an earthquake within a short period of time or an imminent earthquake , with the help of a legal system as well as science and technology ; and helping big and medium-sized cities , densely populated areas , economic developed areas , and in particular , key areas responsible for monitoring and preventing earthquakes enhance their capability of resisting earthquakes and providing emergency relief so as to effectively reduce the losses caused by an earthquake disaster ; 
Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
The trends of international development in recent yeas show that as the funds needed for investment in research and development have been doubled and redoubled , enterprises have been unable to innovate in products alone and that with the rapid renewal of knowledge and technology , it is difficult for enterprises , although with patents and intellectual property rights , to recover their investments in research and development in a short period of time before the appearance of other newer technologies .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
The top leaders of five nations : China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan , met in Dushanbe not long ago and issued a statement , reiterating their joint efforts to strike blows at national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .

The focus of the next step of reform is to vigorously proceed with the institutional reform of the cities , counties , and townships , changing functions , optimizing personnel structures , reducing fiscal and peasant burdens , and improving work efficiency and service quality .  It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and study and to get well prepared for work in all areas .  
New and sophisticated technology and suitable advanced technology should be adopted to accelerate the transformation of the traditional industries , that the ability to produce products which are in short supply on the market , which have high technical contents , and which have international competitiveness should be developed , creating new growth points for industrial development .  
For example , people may have strong material desires , may pursue money fetishism and hedonism , may become hasty in unscrupulously seeking instant successes and gains , may become vulgar and fall short of lofty ideals and beliefs , may become hypocritical and fall short of sound personality , may act in a double-dealing way , and may even behave in a disorderly way without regard to law and order .

" 
We should seize opportunities , and accelerate the pace of upgrading our civil air defense projects .  Within a relatively short time , we should strive to establish and develop an organizational and command system that is unified and highly efficient , a protective engineering system that is rationally structured , a telecommunications and alarm system that is sharp and reliable , a contingent of specialized personnel who are highly competent , an effective system for dispersing the population , and a system for facilitating modern scientific research and cultivating talents .  
Rarely did any of the previous US presidents make it so clear on the issue .  In particular , Bush Junior holds a more conservative attitude toward getting involved in international affairs , while Gore is more active in terms of getting involved in the maintenance of the international order .

It is said that titanic schorl is one of the ores that are in seriously short supply in China , as the current annual output is only 3,000 to 4,000 metric tons .  It is listed by the relevant department as one of the 14 strategic reserve ores for which China is heavily dependent on foreign resources .  Titanic schorl can be used to extract the metal titanium .  
He has indeed devoted great efforts to this end , and it was unexpected that large-scale bloody conflict would erupt at the last crucial moment , causing his efforts to fall short of success at the last ditch , so he would be unable to write a perfect ending to his diplomatic achievements .

It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday .

( 3 ) Compared with his economic achievements , Clinton was weak and inept in diplomatic strategy .  Since it is very difficult for Bush to demonstrate his economic aptitude within a short period of time , he has to use underhand method to score some points first in foreign affairs .  
It relieved farmers of complicated and varied tax and fee payments , and clarified bookkeeping .  In short , it implemented " one tax , one process . "  So farmers are now so enthusiastic about paying their due taxes legally that the entire county accomplished its agricultural tax collection work in just a little over 20 days , something unimaginable in the past .  
After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .  But in the end , because of the restrictions imposed by the social and political environment at that time , the opposite result was the outcome , with the base for future taxes actually increasing , and the farmers ' burden was heavier .  
He said : The NPC standing committee conducted three rounds of careful deliberations on this treaty within a rather short time and ratified it today .  This is further proof of China 's consistent principled position of attaching importance to the promotion and protection of human rights and of actively advocating and conducting , in a committed way , cooperation in the area of human rights .  
At the turn of the century , China 's economy is facing a great deal of opportunities and challenges against the domestic and international background : After more than 20 years of reform and opening up , the domestic market has shaken off the longstanding condition of short supply , the structure of a market economy has been established in a preliminary form , and a fundamental change has occurred in foreign economic relations ;  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .

As far as some other A-level practical subjects , such as technical and computer subjects are concerned , the practical examinations have been abolished after the introduction of TAS . This is because of the short duration and more complex nature of the practical tests involved and hence it is impossible to fully assess the candidates ' performance in the application of technical skills in one single practical examination .

First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .

In short , all of us should work together towards this objective .  
They spent only three odd years from conception of the idea to the implementation of the scheme and the finance committee approved the project only a year and a bit ago .

Since the need for mobility ruled out the use of a tripod , Kuo was forced to turn to flash . At such short range , however , flash is ineffective unless a special moveable mount for the lamp is attached to the camera .  
Despite this modernization , most tribes have preserved their ancient sacrificial ceremonies . The annual harvest ritual of the Tsao tribe and the sacrificial ceremony of the Saisiat tribe in honor of the pygmies ( short people , as the aborigines call them ) , are perhaps the most representative . The Saisiat aborigines hold a sacrificial ceremony in the autumn every two years , and a grand ceremony every 10 years .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
The former begins with a lively waltz , projecting a fresh exuberance . Its short segments include literature appreciation , public health lectures , and general legal topics , all of which are intended to relate to daily life and inspire self-improvement .  
The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
Originally , the school 's regulations dictated that , among other things , the students wear uniforms all year round - - white shirts and black slacks , with khaki jackets in the winter ; that the male students have their hair cut short every three weeks ; that the students obtain written permission to leave the school grounds and that the students assume the responsibility of keeping the campus clean .

During the period from 1945 to 1949 , for example , just after the country had experienced eight years of war and destitution , some angry young people chose Marxism , believing it to be a magic panacea , a short cut to Utopia . Today these people , now old men and women , must deeply regret the mistaken choice they made back then , or they may have already paid the price for it with their lives .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
The vase should be tall and erect and the jug short and stout , while the flowers may be either gorgeous and impressive , such as camellias , dahlias , chrysanthemums , and peonies , or noble and refined , such as plum blossoms , pine branches , bamboos , and orchids . "  
Most of the changes are clearly positive ; however , some have caused us to take a second look at where we are going . Our government and people are now in the position of having to come up with quick answers to a wide range of new and challenging questions . Unlike many nations of the West that have had well over a century to gradually adjust to political and economic modernization , the Republic of China is having to compact this development into the short span of a few decades .  
It 's almost as if golden linings had already been woven within the gray , and as soon as they are turned over , a myriad of golden rays will shoot forth . The birds have n't fully awakened yet ; only an occasional few short hoarse chirps are heard as they awaken from a night of dreaming in the treetops before they turn over and go back to sleep .  
Gulls are plump-bodied with a short thick neck , a stout bill with a long hooked upper beak , a round or squared tail and large webs well adapted for swimming .  
But many new immigrants from Taiwan , despite being proven veterans on the fiercely competitive economic battlefield at home and arriving with full coffers and detailed plans for investment , tend to pull up short and halt the troops when they see the business efficiency , market order , rise of labor consciousness , severe labor shortage ( even worse than Taiwan 's ) and high operating costs they must face . . . even if they do n't beat a hasty retreat .  
The agricultural mission not only helps Malawi develop agriculture but also serves our foreign service community there by providing them with fresh produce and playing the role of general jacks-of-all-trades and Mr . Fix-it 's . If the car breaks down , if it has a flat tire , if the screen door 's stuck , if you need some styrofoam or nylon cord for packing , if you 're short a blanket and pillow for a guest . . . just track down a team member and you 're sure to come away satisfied .  
Mahjongg 's compulsive hold over its aficionados can be seen from the following true stories : A typhoon had forced Liu Hsiao-chen to cut short her trip down south , and worriedly she made her way back to Taipei . As she neared home through knee-deep flood water and in the pitch dark of a power blackout her anxiety grew . But stepping in at the door , there were her parents and a couple of neighbors happily engrossed in a game of mahjongg , playing by candlelight and with their feet perched up on stools .  
Applying mental reasoning Chang Shih-tsung is adept at finding lateral links between things , using supporting material and coming up with new deductions . Starting from a rapid-fire " chopstick gun " invented by Taiwanese kids , he began to collect toy weapons from other countries and investigate their construction and performance . From our own history he found a rapid-fire crossbow from the Three Kingdoms Period , and has written a short paper on the subject .  
Explains an experienced naval officer : " Because they are versatile and swift , they can get anywhere nearby within a very short period of time . Stationing them at outer islands increases combat strength throughout the seas around Taiwan . In combination with onshore missiles they amount to a formidable control over the Taiwan Straits . " Whenever there is a fourth-degree alert the missile speedboats are ordered to deploy to outer islands , and when the alert is raised to third-degree they disperse among military harbors , ready for combat at anytime .  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
Now people will think of going to check out Europe . With the improved economic situation in Taiwan , there 's only the language problem , which Leuven has solved by providing the international curriculum . So all at once everyone began coming . " Here he makes a short critique : " Those coming for travel and study - - without clear study objectives , with the aim of adding to what they 've seen and experienced - - are more numerous than those coming in pursuit of scholarship . "  
Poor grades are bad enough - - what they 're even more worried about is that their darling little child , having fallen in with a " mixed crowd " back in the slow learner class , will be led astray on a short path to nowhere : no higher schooling , no steady employment and a life of idleness , dillydallying and shiftlessness . . . .  
Water comes from heaven . " In agricultural societies , things which are filtered out with water are all organic matter that can be broken down and returned to the natural cycle . Thus , in several places in north Taiwan which are relatively short of water , the agricultural irrigation system and the town or village drainage system were linked together , so that water could be circulated and reused , thus saving water resources .  
Despite having been established for only a short time , in the last two " preparatory " years the bicycle R &amp; D center has already come up with sixteen applications for special patents to provide to manufacturers for mass production . Moreover , an even more important breakthrough has been creation of equipment for precise measuring of the mutual tolerance of the bicycle frame and the other parts ( in the past they could only make rough guesses ) , which saves the enterprises the trouble of muddling through for themselves .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
Originally , no lead-containing ingredients were used in the preparation of pa-pao-san . Large amounts of cinnabar were , however , and because cinnabar was expensive and in short supply , some Chinese pharmacists substituted other mineral in-gredients , such as huang-tan ( yellow lead ) or chientan ( red lead or minimum - - the scientific name is lead tetraoxide ) , which are similar to cinnabar in color . The result of this misuse was numerous cases of lead poisoning in newborn infants .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude . After four years of professional baseball , there are still many shortcomings to be urgently addressed . But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .  
Although in the short period that the garden has been open there have been cases of chicken bones being found stuffed into crevices in trees and disposable nappies being picked up in secluded spots , on the whole things have stayed pretty clean .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
Waking from a dream of riches only to be executed , you feel that life is short / Life and death are fated , neither rich nor poor can escape / The seasons change , the sun sets in the west and the water still flows / Where is the general 's horse today , the field is covered with flowers and grass / Life is a lonely boat , day and night the water flows upward / The boat is smashed and repaired / Death brings respite from the affairs of the world .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
Kang Mu-hsiang , who applies sculptural concepts in his carving , attracts customers to his studio with a large picture of himself holding a chisel and a gouge . Tseng Chin-tsai 's sign uses the theme of a swineherd in the old agricultural society and the song " When Will You Return ? " to allude to the inevitability of suffering in human life . Here one can also find pottery studios , a studio producing mainly carvings of horses , and so on . All the color of Sanyi is concentrated in this one short street .  
An unnecessary luxuryIn the early years of the Republic of China , the famous author Lu Hsun , in a short story entitled " The Blessing " ( " Chu Fu " ) , published in his anthology Indecision ( " P'aihuai " ) , satirized a modern youth who scorned the characters of the feudal age , yet longed for " Fuhsing Lou Restaurant 's shark fin simmered in clear broth , a dollar a serving , cheap and tasty - - is it still so cheap ?  
In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
The Ghostbusting Eight Generals " is Sinorama 's final installment in our series on Taiwan 's yi-chen . Our writer , with detailed graphs , exquisite pictures and intriguing text , has brought the past back to us who grew up in Taiwan 's little villages , reminding us of times we were squeezed among the grown-ups as we all watched the members of an " ghostbusting " procession , tall and short , faces covered with frightening paint .  
For instance , the tall and lanky General Hsieh whirls like a white crane spreading its wings opposite the short and stocky General Fan , who squats low and makes monkey-style kungfu movements . " Each of the dancers has a different character , and there is a dialogue between them , " says Chen Li-e , going on to explain that the generals ' movements and positions can be varied flexibly depending on the size of the space in which they perform .  
Inside such a stressful and congested campus , there is one rare space which offers some relief . Students suffering immense pressure can come here , relax and browse ; they can enjoy newspapers , magazines , music , instant noodles , coffee and candied fruit ; they can even take a short nap on the carpeted floor .  
And once they have been admitted , it is difficult to discharge them . Chronic illness includes stroke-induced paralysis , pathological changes to the liver and kidney , and rheumatoid arthritis . Patients with those afflictions can not possibly get well and leave the hospital within a short period of time . As a result , those patients who are actually in urgent need of hospitalization can not find a bed covered by insurance ( ie . , in common rooms with three or more beds ) .  
In the past , depictions of nature often stopped short at the level of hypochondriac moaning . Today we should write slowly and deliberately about our personal , genuine environment , about the full range of phenomena , and we should employ all the different forms of literature . Good works , even works of complete philosophical reflection , will then arise .  
In order to accommodate the living habits of the village 's Saisiyat residents , Wu thought of incorporating the short spirit ceremony into the dance , and with that in mind in 1994 he specially attended the biannual ceremony at Sky Lake , where he taped the entire thing . He also spent time off from work to visit with Saisiyat elders and the parents of the students in order to get a firm grip on the meaning behind the ceremony .  
First , on the basis of Delft 's experience with red stoneware , he improved the kiln design to produce a higher firing temperature and made a hard red stoneware similar to Yixing ware . But sadly this still fell some way short of the pure white porcelain which the elector craved after day and night .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again . The idea of setting up something eternal by a short term effort emphasizes the idea of a panacea . The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
One noteworthy , and rather unexpected thing , is that this clean-room air which is " 1000 times more pure than outside air " - in which even filtrable viruses find it hard to survive-does not make one feel refreshed and energetic . On the contrary , after a short period you feel stifled and dizzy . You really have to admire those women production line workers who spend 12 hours a day in there .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
The black plum ( Prunus mume-also known by other names such as the Japanese flowering apricot ) is a small deciduous tree of the rose family ( Rosaceae ) . Its new shoots are bright green ; the trunk is straight and vertical ; the flower petioles are short .  
The King Car Educational Foundation , whose stated purpose is to promote basic education for children and adolescents , carried out physical examinations on 200 sixth graders at the Hsingan Elementary School , and the results were even more startling . Of the students tested , many fell short of the Ministry of Education 's reference value : 91 percent fell short for muscular endurance , 86 percent for instantaneous force , and 41 percent for cardiopulmonary endurance .  
A little color will make your features more prominent , your skin color better . . . ' " After spending NT $ 1,500 to have her hair cut short and dyed a not very obvious coffee color , she thinks it was expensive , but " the results were pretty good " because " lots of people ca n't tell I had it done . "  
The traditional dress of India is the " sari , " a single sheet of cloth made into a skirt that goes to the ground ; it is both mysterious and graceful . The Philippines , using locally produced palmetto cloth , has crocheted and embroidered shirts . Indonesian " batik , " wax-dyed or hand-dyed , is cool and comfortable ; a sarong around the waist with a short jacket open in the front is comfortable and beautiful .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
Most may remember how , wherever Chiang went , he was always accompanied by burly individuals in casual dress or suits , with short , neatly groomed hair and stern expressions . These were the men everyone referred to simply as the " Chihais , " and their main mission was to assure the personal safety of the head of state 24 hours a day .  
Most observers approved of Siew 's decisive handling of the case as maintaining the team spirit of the cabinet . Though Liao later made a strong statement attacking Siew and Control Yuan President Wang Tso-yung was also critical , the incident was settled in a short time due to Premier Siew 's actions .  
Nevertheless , it was only in the 1990s that homosexual writing really became prominent in literary circles in Taiwan and became a fad . G &amp; L Magazine founder James An points out that in recent years there has been a flurry of Chinese-language homosexual literature . Works of gay literaure have won lucrative prizes in all categories-novels , novellas , and short stories . It is impossible to deny the achievements of this body of work .  
Because of agricultural crops ' short harvesting cycles , there is as yet little alternative to controlling pest outbreaks by the moderate use of pesticides , unless production methods can be changed ; but when transient insect infestations occur in gardens or in woodland-except where " wood borers " such as ghost moths ( family Hepialidae ) or goat moths ( family Cosiidae ) , which are potentially fatal to trees , are involved-forestry experts generally advise against attempting wholesale eradication with pesticides .  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
" Actually , controlling aging does n't mean rejecting aging . It means healthy , successful aging . " Dr . Wang says , " Aging is a natural , gradual , lifelong process . It is not the complete loss of one 's health and beauty within a very short period .  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
Wang Anyi 's short story was a trailblazer , because it appeared at a time when communist ideology still held considerable sway in the literary sphere . " Wang feels that there is no need for a writer to play the part of a social scientist and use a novel as a means of criticizing anything . She has always focused on the individual .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich . But this class arose in such a short time period here that it does n't have a well-formed culture of its own , and therefore consumption , which demonstrates that wealth has been acquired , has become its most glaring trademark .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
Chiu Chung-hsien is the principal of Taipei County 's Hsiushan Elementary School , which won four first prizes for ensembles at this year 's provincial competition and one national second prize . Chiu says that because most parents do n't know which schools offer music programs , and those students without musical ability are too intimidated to sign up for the test , about one-half to one-third of those who apply are accepted . In short , it is n't that difficult to get into a program .  
Each week , the segment features three well-developed hunks dressed in swim suits . Following a short conversation between each contestant and the hosts , female audience members approach the stage to place stickers on their favorite choice , and the contestant with the most stickers is declared the winner . The young women are hardly ever shy about flirting with the contestants , seizing the chance to cop a feel of their bare bodies or placing stickers on the more sensitive areas of the male anatomy .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
And so she moved in a short time from perusing a few thin standardized teachers ' guides , to having a muddled understanding of Chinese grammar and history , to introducing China-that vast and distant land-to students who were even more ignorant of it than her . It was no easy feat .  
The function of the garden , where you can chat and exchange ideas , is kind of like the role a museum plays as it attempts to communicate its message to society . The paper museum has already weathered one serious storm in its short existence , and it has proved to be a hardy survivor , organizing a number of outstanding temporary exhibits . There truly is something special about the Su-Ho Memorial Paper Museum . Expect this beautiful gem to be a fixture on Changan East Road for a long time to come !  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
On the other hand , Mu Huai-ling of VGH points out that even when one does go in for a rich feast at the New Year , it is better to eat fish than meat , better to eat lean meat than streaky pork complete with its rind and fat , and better to eat sea cucumber than cholesterol-rich mullet roe or crab eggs ; in short , you ca n't go wrong by cutting down on meat and eating plenty of vegetables , fruit and whole grains .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
Anaphalis nepalensis ( 11 ) ( family Asteraceae ) is a typical Taiwanese alpine plant . It has a short stem , and the whole plant is covered in fluffy hairs and papery round flowers which give it excellent protection against the cold .  
Another writer whose works have won a warm reception in translation is Cheng Ching-wen . According to David Der-wei Wang , chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University , over the past half century Cheng has recorded and carried on the spirit of humanism in Taiwan ; his work is measured and sophisticated , totally different from the unsettled state of modern society . Last year , Cheng won the 1999 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize for the English translation of his collection of short stories entitled Three-Legged Horse .  
During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds . Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time . In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang-sheng and Lin Yen-hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men 's singles .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
" When the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like Feng Fei-fei , " Wang notes . " Sun Yan Zi fills this need perfectly . " Moreover , she has had the right material , with producer Peter Li providing songs that have individual character but stop short of being avant garde . This has allowed her to stand apart from the pop singers who just blindly follow the marketplace .  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
" The natural environment is always changing . Even if the number of monkeys has been increasing in the short term , there are so many uncertain factors that it is very hard to say that their populations will grow in the long term . " Wu Hai-yin is the first biologist to have written a doctoral thesis about Formosan rock monkeys .  
When the participants boarded the ferry and completed the short hop to Xiamen , it constituted the first cultural exchange between Kinmen and the PRC under the newly established " three mini-links . " It was very gratifying to see the artistic occasion carried off without the slightest hint of political overtones .  
As visitors hurry by on their way from one scenic spot to the next , on the steep slopes they see the patches of Japanese knotweed , stonecrop and spiraea , with little flowers blossoming shyly in all shades of yellow and red ; the dense , short arrow bamboo ; and the Yushan roses heavy with rose hips . But only Lo Liu-chih knows that at little more than arm 's length , the tangled vegetation hides many nests laboriously built by a bird found only in Taiwan .  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
When Taiwanese music fell on hard times , Wen made 11 tours of the island in his white convertible sports car with his four " sisters " in back . Tooling around in the car with his " sisters , " the girls holding guitars and dressed in short red skirts , the five of them looked like the height of cool .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
Chen 's sense of fashion made a deep impression on me the first time we met . Still short of his 40th birthday , he was dressed in a smartly tailored black suit . The collar was turned up , and he looked a bit like the dashing lead in some detective movie . His hair was combed forward and upward , as is very much in style these days .  
Among the intergenerational developments raising eyebrows and causing debate at the time were the following : sons and daughters-in-law unwilling to live with their parents after marriage ; younger women leaving home to earn a wage and thereby shifting power in the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law ; children demanding to make their own decisions about work and marriage ; and the government encouraging three generations to live together under the same roof . In short , the screws were loosening on many of the structures that supported traditional notions about filial piety .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
Several older women , looking indescribably happy , start their hands and feet in perpetual motion , and in a short time the entire area has been completely cleaned , a gas stove has been set up , and vegetables have been washed and chopped . Before you know it , the aroma of fried rice-noodles begins to permeate the clinic site .  
Strolling around the embassy compound , I discover new greenery amidst the flowers and grass , so parched and brittle just a short time before . The green and sour mangoes on the trees have been transformed instantaneously , becoming lusciously red and ripe .  
The Nationalist government 's Taiwan policy at that time was to reverse the Japanization of the island , and shortly after the end of the war it banned the use of Japanese . Authors who wrote in Japanese lost their medium , and the Taiwanese people , most of whom were as yet unfamiliar with Mandarin , became effectively illiterate . In short , the policy wrought cultural havoc on Taiwanese society .  
The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
One experience I will never forget . At Easter , we traveled to the western regions of Queensland . We departed at 4 a.m . and drove past wheat farms , corn farms , crossing a huge broad land , from tall bush to short scrub , from gray-yellow land to bright red . It was fantastic !  
In the space of a few short months , a university student , a high ranking police officer , and a famous university professor chose to jump off high buildings , while an unemployed man committed suicide by igniting a gas canister and a soldier killed himself with charcoal fumes . The numerous suicide cases cast a dark shadow over all of society .  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
When resources were short and a good number of books were forbidden , it was the second-hand book market that helped spread knowledge , and reading was considered more important than collecting . Today there are up to 400,000 new books published a year , so why do people still want to collect old books ? " It 's because the sheer volume of books being published is huge , it 's like a sea of books out there .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless . By contrast , at present only around 40-50 larger sets of photovoltaic panels are installed in Taiwan to generate electricity from the sun 's rays . On public land and buildings , to date the MOEA has completed demonstration systems in only a few locations including the Presidential Palace and the Yushan meteorological observatory . There is also little sign of enthusiasm for installations on ordinary residential buildings .  
Huang Yuan-cheng currently makes a living by selling tea , telling fortunes , and gravesite divination . He was divorced when his daughter was only six months old , yet , in what seems like a short stretch of time , his daughter is ready to start elementary school . Looking back on the many bumps in the road and setbacks he has seen as a single father , Huang still does n't know how he made it this far .  
While education reform is something that countries all over the world are engaged in , Prudence Chu-ing Chou , professor at National Chengchi 's University College of Education , finds it " unprecedented " that Taiwan , with its limited resources as well as inadequate accompanying measures , is pushing ahead with such sweeping education reforms in such a short amount of time .  
Examples include a Gandhara Buddhist statue from India 's Kushan Dynasty , replete with curly locks and Greek-like aquiline noses , as well as a kingly Cambodian Buddha with a cone-like coiffure gathered at the top of its head , a bare torso , and a short fish-tail skirt tied at the waist . The NPM designed the exhibition layout with a walkway flanked by Buddhas between the South Asian and East Asian areas .

Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
In the area of investment , there was already a growing pattern of investment among developing countries However , virtually all private direct foreign investment in the developing world had been concentrated on a short list of middle income countries  
That is why we ask for the unfailing support and backing of the international community , which , we feel , should in the short - , medium - and long-term involve substantial , increased and strengthened technical and financial cooperation . 
In our view , a viable judicial system , supported by an effective civil and police administration , would in the short run assist the Government to put Rwanda back on its feet and enable it to pursue the goals of social and economic development .  
In terms of the international community , the level of financial support has consistently fallen short of requirements .  To a great extent this can be attributed to the economic difficulties experienced by industrialized countries in recent years .  
In short , the draft resolution contains measures that are all comprehensive in nature , but to implement them we need to apply our wholehearted and determined efforts and thus bring this unbelievable human tragedy to a speedy close .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
In short , the Special Rapporteur attaches great importance to the prevention of manifestations of racism in any form whatsoever , through governmental , legislative , administrative , economic and social and , above all , educational measures .  
At every level local , national , regional , international and global there is an awareness that the United Nations , for all its setbacks , is recognized for having done so much , so well and in such a short span of time .  
Despite the fact that primary education has been free and mandatory under the Constitution since the early days of the Republic , there is a sector of our young population that , because of economic and social factors leading to hunger , poverty and social disintegration , is more exposed to marginalization and crime in short , to exclusion .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
Building upon political and economic stability , ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed that contribute to consolidating the opening of our economies , the transparency of our markets , and the growth of commercial exchange with other regions in short , the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a better future for our peoples .  
This is because we are fully aware , as the Summit itself has underscored , that nothing short of a renewed and massive political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
The agenda item entitled Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons has been under consideration for several years in our Commission . For various reasons , the Commission has been unable to formulate a set of satisfactory guidelines for nuclear disarmament , thus falling short of people 's expectations . 
Intensive , short , practical training programmes with emphasis on skills in effective communication , community organization and facilitation of behaviour change should be developed in order to prepare the local personnel of all sectors involved in social development for carrying out their respective roles .  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
Nothing short of a renewed and massive political will , at the national and international level , to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .  
The comprehensive agreement is the only agreement that has been in full force and subject to specific verification for almost a year now , yet the current status of compliance with it - the practical expression of which would be a marked improvement in respect for human rights in Guatemala - stands in stark contrast to and falls far short of what was agreed .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
They stressed that the existing assurances and unilateral declarations fell far short of the credible assurances sought by non-nuclear-weapon States and that , in order to be effective , the assurances should be unconditional , without qualification , not subject to divergent interpretation and unlimited in scope , application and duration . 
An urban strategy for the short and medium term should aim at reducing the large numbers of underemployed currently engaged in the so-called informal sector and low-wage services sector by increasing labour absorption in modern formal industry .  
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .  
The United Nations needed to be more competitive in the international professional market and the current salary package fell particularly short in respect of nationals from both developed and developing countries who had other options for employment .  
More important , there is a widespread belief among politicians and senior government officials that the adoption of sound environmental practices would result in lower rates of economic growth in the short run , that pollution control would divert scarce resources from more relevant social areas and that it would lead to price increases .  
Although progress towards universal education and literacy has been impressive in recent times , the number of illiterate people will continue to grow and many developing countries are likely to fall short of universal primary education by the year 2000 .  Three main concerns regarding current systems of education may be expressed .  
At the outset of this statement , I should like to express our deepest sympathy to the delegation and Government of France and to the families of the two valiant and honourable members of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) whose valuable lives were cut short at such an early age by the merciless and cold-blooded actions of professional killers , whoever they may be .  
In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement , Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region ; democracies have been established and transformed ; respect for human rights has been strengthened , and the new regional integration system has been defined . "  
These internally displaced persons have suffered the hardships typical of other refugees and internally displaced persons : they were forced to flee their homes and established community structures at very short notice , unaware of where they were going or how they would end up and having to endure temporary shelter and extremely poor living conditions .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
States should be less restrictive and more liberal in the granting of visas to nationals of countries of the South and call on their populations to be more receptive to foreigners and to cultural interchange .  181 .  In the short term , as the United Nations strives for peace on several fronts , radical measures are urgently needed to curb radio stations that promote ethnic or racial hatred and to suppress clandestine radio stations which engage in such activities .  
NULLAlthough the case of Mexico had several unique features , once the crisis began international securities investors suddenly reassessed their risks in all the emerging market economies : the contagious effect of the Mexican crisis left no developing country untouched in the short term .

An initiative put forward by the President of Russia , Mr . Yeltsin , has received broad international backing that is , the initiative on the holding in the spring of 1996 of a summit meeting on issues of nuclear security , to consider pressing problems in this area and define ways to solve them , in both the short and the long term .  
While increasing the number of African States participating in the stand-by arrangements is an ongoing process in the short and medium term , I invite those African States that are already participating to cooperate with the Stand-by Arrangements Management Team to compile a complete picture , by the spring of 1996 , of specialized and heavy equipment needs .  
The bands of Taliban , under the direct control of the Pakistani Government , recently gathered at the outskirts of the capital Kabul and suffered repeated setbacks as a result of the crushing blows by the forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , thus falling short of their heinous plans of taking over the city of Kabul .  
In the interests of increased savings and the successful implementation of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and given the fact that the outcome thus far had fallen short of expectations , his delegation attached great importance to the ongoing efforts of resident coordinators to ensure closer involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions in operational activities , in particular at the field level . 
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
If power politics are allowed to be deployed in the pursuit of exclusive and narrow interests in a climate of confrontation , if the world 's resources are shared on the basis of military power rather than of international treaties and conventions , if priority is not given to international law and international cooperation , and if we attempt to evade the responsibilities that we have all undertaken under the Charter , however appealing and convenient that might appear in the short term , we will sow the seeds of chaos , anarchy and rapid disintegration .  
Although these models have generated deceptive , apparently attractive macroeconomic indicators , in practice they go hand in hand with an increase in poverty , marginalization , environmental degradation , disease , ignorance , social conflict , a loss of national resources and sovereignty in short , with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible underdevelopment .  
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
In the year and a half since the World Summit for Social Development , many countries have made great efforts in implementing the outcome of the Summit at the national level by designating national focal points , formulating short - , medium - and long-term strategies and plans for social development and starting to take appropriate and concrete measures to implement them .  
My country has assumed the responsibility to diminish poverty in the short term through social and economic strategies geared not only towards meeting basic physical needs such as health , nutrition , education and work , but which are also aimed at defending human rights and promoting the equitable distribution of income and wealth .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .  
In short , the enjoyment of human rights was closely linked to the international community 's ability to ensure the universal ratification and implementation of instruments that dealt with the rights that all States represented in Vienna had pledged to protect .  The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
However , the progress made towards establishing the institutional and physical infrastructure for the active involvement of the public and private sector in the economy , though notable , fell short of expectations , which appeared to have been overly optimistic .

[ 140 ] / The short " excursion " into the field of substantive problems had been useful in order to shed more light on a subject generally considered to be very complex and sensitive as well as to realistically assess the prospects of different approaches in addressing specific problems . 
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
The cease-fire broke down on 29 April when an attempted meeting of the Council of State , attended by Chairman Sankawulo together with Councilmen Taylor and Kromah , was cut short after fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and NPFL / ULIMO-K forces near the executive mansion .

The series fills a real gap on the human-rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
It was stated that small satellites had already been flown with considerable success by many organizations ; their attraction lay in the promise of low-cost and short development times made possible by the use of proven standard equipment and techniques , coupled with a realistic expectation of performance .  
Many special representatives and envoys were retained on a " when actually employed " ( WAE ) basis , by which their services were retained by the Organization when there was a need for work of an intermittent or discontinuous nature ; for assignments whose duration was uncertain , or whose timing was not clearly identifiable in advance ; or to ensure the availability at short notice of persons with special skills required by the Organization .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .

Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
The Mission continued to stress the need to plan the short , medium and long-term phases of this complex process , bearing in mind the political , technical and social implications of the reform .  
Before the astonished eyes of a silent public , we have in recent years been able to " see " the gravest violations of the right to life for ethnic and racial motives , death from hunger in atrocious conditions of thousands upon thousands of children and people of all ages , in short , atrocities that in the old world with less intercommunication only came to be known many years later through books and distant reports , and were sometimes never known at all by the public .  
The Joint Border Commission continues to meet on a regular basis and to focus on resolving the disputed border areas it had previously identified , but the results of its work have thus far fallen short of the expectations and the public statements of intent of the two parties in this regard .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
Debt-relief measures for the least developed countries would help to release scarce resources in order to boost social and human development expenditure and to finance investment in critical economic restructuring in the short term and medium term .  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
However , on a number of occasions the response fell short of the amount required to complete other programmes .  The main projects that still require funding include those on democratic institutions and productive and social reintegration .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce .

At the end of the three-year period , it would be possible to evaluate the degree to which the objectives had been attained and on that basis decide whether work on enterprise development represented an important contribution to development and therefore whether it should form part of the elements presented for ministerial consideration at UNCTAD X . In short , work on an enterprise development strategy must be based on a strategic vision , the elements of the strategy must contribute to growth and development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability , and the strategy must be amenable to evaluation . 
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .

While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
A short but substantive / analytical / factual summary prepared by the Secretariat of the informal consultations of the Security Council should be circulated as an official document of the Council to all Member States the day after such meetings .

When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
Priority is being given , therefore , to establishing links with radio stations worldwide , which will enable instantaneous use of the Departments radio programmes , through the most effective delivery system available in each region or subregion , including short wave , satellite , digital audio , telephone feeds , electronic audio-file transfer and other Internet-based mechanisms .

The major policy recommendations in the area of social development include enhanced budgetary allocations for social services , establishment of a formal social fund , targeting of measures related to employment creation , cash transfers , free or subsidized provision of essential goods and services and credit facilities in the short term , introduction of an effective system of unemployment insurance , and revision of development strategies to minimize vulnerability to crises in the future .  
The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
The Office for Civil Affairs , which will be responsible for overseeing and , where necessary , conducting a number of civil affairs functions , such as civil service and economic and budgetary affairs , as well as supporting the restoration and provision , in the short run , of basic public services , such as public health , education , utilities , transport and telecommunications . 
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .

In the short to medium term , the productivity , competitiveness and market access of traditional commodity products should be promoted with a view to achieving greater revenue and relative stability in export earnings and the development of a more diversified and dynamic economic base .  
However , key parts of the deterioration ( such as the accumulation in the spring of 1997 by the central bank of Thailand of a large part of the forward exchange liabilities that depleted its net foreign exchange reserves ) may take place during short periods , so that improved disclosure would not necessarily protect the debtor from sudden reactions by creditors and investors which are highly concentrated in time .

Consumer demand is short for three main reasons : 1 .  Since reform and opening , while the absolute value of the income and consumption level of Chinese residents has been growing steadily , the ratio of our society 's gross product that is eventually used for consumption , or the final consumption rate , has been in a falling trend , with our accumulation or savings rate having tended to rise .  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .

In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
It is absurd , because it regards a local government within a country of sovereignty and territorial integrity as an " independent state . "  This is nothing short of challenging and illegally plundering the fundamental interests of all the people of the country .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
Within a very short period of 20 years , Chinese economy made huge progress , the people 's living standards rose to a new height , and the integrated national strength made an enormous step forward .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
They should also be introduced if they meet relevant requirements .  In short , capable personnel are the basic conditions for doing any work .  As long as the recruitment of such capable personnel is conducive to the building of national defense and to the modernization of our armed forces , we should strive to recruit them without sticking to one pattern .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
As for the process of handling the incident , Jin Chanrong said , there existed some problems in the foreign policy-making body of the Bush administration .  Although there are some veteran officials with rich experience inside the government , it was hard to find someone who may have a final say and can convince others , or it is possible that the veterans with experience may be short of the ability to handle new problems .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
Some MAC members maintained that the status quo between Washington , Beijing , and Taipei would not go on forever .  They said that Taiwan must come up with short - , medium - and long-term Mainland policies and objectives to deal with the " intermediate agreement " that the US side once mentioned , and the " one country , two systems " formula the Mainland authorities persistently follows.Some other MAC members pointed out that the government has been acting rather passively in approaching current international affairs .  
The trend is still unclear about who will win and who will lose in the cross-strait economic competition over the short , mid - , and long-term periods .  Although the mainland has a superior condition for economic development , Taiwan still has such favorable conditions as being ahead in technology , having the ability to conform , and international competitiveness , and it still has room for development .  
If the government department or organ that is in charge of examining and approving projects approves a project that falls short of the safety requirements prescribed in the law , regulations and rules , its chief responsible person shall be disciplined in the form of demotion , dismissal , or deprived of the right to public office according to the seriousness of the offense .  
With Jiang Shibao 's high-altitude monitoring , Li Mingquan pressed close to this small airplane , made a tight spiral which was close to the ultimate limit , and firmly " netted " the target - - the distance was so short that even the cabin meters of the opposite side could be clearly seen .  
The opponent , who was in a rush for a short moment , was finally forced to land at the seaside - - investigation showed that the pilot of this small airplane was a man who once won the championship in the world super light airplane flying competition and had 25 years of flying experience .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .

Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
Under the guidance of the " 17-point agreement , " the people in Tibet drove out the imperialist invading forces , put an end to the state of permanently being backward , sealed off , and stagnant , and made great progress which has attracted worldwide attention in the short period of 50 years .  The economic development , social progress , and remarkable improvement in the living standards of the people are trends of history .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
It is the most preferable to expand the fish pond and raise fish of selected new breeds .  In short , establish and improve good operating mechanisms for training " thousand-mile horses " on the basis of forward-looking thinking and advance designing , so as to change from passively waiting for personnel to proactively training personnel .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , the vast numbers of overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have played an irreplaceable role in enabling China to exchange and cooperate with all countries , introduce large amounts of foreign funds , enter the international market , and sell home-made products to different parts of the world in a very short time .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina Patricio Echegaray , and the Party 's Secretary for International Relations Athos Fava , said in a congratulatory telegram to Jiang Zemin , " The Chinese Communist Party , established 80 years ago by a small number of revolutionaries in the historically famous city of Shanghai , proposed the objective of seizing political power and establishing socialist society .  It seized power within the relatively short span of 28 years .  
The officials and men cooled down after hearing forceful evidences and logical analyses , and reached a common understanding : The base was not harsh , but our training fell short of the requirements of real battles .  
Zhao Leji , a native of Qinghai , has made himself conspicuous within a very short period of time in recent years , and is now the youngest governor in the country .  He is considered to enjoy a promising political future , and there is wide speculation that he will become one of state leaders of the new generation .

In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .

The trends of international development in recent yeas show that as the funds needed for investment in research and development have been doubled and redoubled , enterprises have been unable to innovate in products alone and that with the rapid renewal of knowledge and technology , it is difficult for enterprises , although with patents and intellectual property rights , to recover their investments in research and development in a short period of time before the appearance of other newer technologies .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
The top leaders of five nations : China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan , met in Dushanbe not long ago and issued a statement , reiterating their joint efforts to strike blows at national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .

Rarely did any of the previous US presidents make it so clear on the issue .

It relieved farmers of complicated and varied tax and fee payments , and clarified bookkeeping .  In short , it implemented " one tax , one process . "  So farmers are now so enthusiastic about paying their due taxes legally that the entire county accomplished its agricultural tax collection work in just a little over 20 days , something unimaginable in the past .  
After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .  But in the end , because of the restrictions imposed by the social and political environment at that time , the opposite result was the outcome , with the base for future taxes actually increasing , and the farmers ' burden was heavier .  
He said : The NPC standing committee conducted three rounds of careful deliberations on this treaty within a rather short time and ratified it today .  This is further proof of China 's consistent principled position of attaching importance to the promotion and protection of human rights and of actively advocating and conducting , in a committed way , cooperation in the area of human rights .  
At the turn of the century , China 's economy is facing a great deal of opportunities and challenges against the domestic and international background : After more than 20 years of reform and opening up , the domestic market has shaken off the longstanding condition of short supply , the structure of a market economy has been established in a preliminary form , and a fundamental change has occurred in foreign economic relations ;  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .

First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .  
Apart from our exotic harbour , night scene and diverse landscapes which are well-known through the millions of tourists who visited us over the years , we also have in Hong Kong highly experienced production crews , first-rate film production services , efficient communications and transport networks , user-friendly application procedures for location filming permits , and of course , the wide range of support services rendered by the FSO , " added Ms Mak , who is used to dealing with urgent requests on short notice from film crews and persuading hesitant parties to accommodate them .

Lastly , we all agreed that if Hong Kong was to enjoy a healthy development across the whole economic , political and social spectrum , we must make every effort to maintain stability and stay united .  We must also ensure Hong Kong and the Mainland develop a good interactive relationship within the " One Country , Two Systems " framework .  In short , all of us should work together towards this objective .  
They spent only three odd years from conception of the idea to the implementation of the scheme and the finance committee approved the project only a year and a bit ago .  So within a very short period of time , they have introduced a highly complex , a very massive project and I 'm very grateful for the work by our Immigration colleagues in this regard .  
Since the need for mobility ruled out the use of a tripod , Kuo was forced to turn to flash . At such short range , however , flash is ineffective unless a special moveable mount for the lamp is attached to the camera .  
Despite this modernization , most tribes have preserved their ancient sacrificial ceremonies . The annual harvest ritual of the Tsao tribe and the sacrificial ceremony of the Saisiat tribe in honor of the pygmies ( short people , as the aborigines call them ) , are perhaps the most representative . The Saisiat aborigines hold a sacrificial ceremony in the autumn every two years , and a grand ceremony every 10 years .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
The former begins with a lively waltz , projecting a fresh exuberance . Its short segments include literature appreciation , public health lectures , and general legal topics , all of which are intended to relate to daily life and inspire self-improvement .  
The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
Originally , the school 's regulations dictated that , among other things , the students wear uniforms all year round - - white shirts and black slacks , with khaki jackets in the winter ; that the male students have their hair cut short every three weeks ; that the students obtain written permission to leave the school grounds and that the students assume the responsibility of keeping the campus clean .  
Twenty years and still drifting , " says he , in a voice tinged with a Shanghai accent . He is dressed in black , hair cut short and sharp . " It seems some instinct for existence has kept me alive . "  
During the period from 1945 to 1949 , for example , just after the country had experienced eight years of war and destitution , some angry young people chose Marxism , believing it to be a magic panacea , a short cut to Utopia . Today these people , now old men and women , must deeply regret the mistaken choice they made back then , or they may have already paid the price for it with their lives .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
The vase should be tall and erect and the jug short and stout , while the flowers may be either gorgeous and impressive , such as camellias , dahlias , chrysanthemums , and peonies , or noble and refined , such as plum blossoms , pine branches , bamboos , and orchids . "  
Most of the changes are clearly positive ; however , some have caused us to take a second look at where we are going . Our government and people are now in the position of having to come up with quick answers to a wide range of new and challenging questions . Unlike many nations of the West that have had well over a century to gradually adjust to political and economic modernization , the Republic of China is having to compact this development into the short span of a few decades .  
It 's almost as if golden linings had already been woven within the gray , and as soon as they are turned over , a myriad of golden rays will shoot forth . The birds have n't fully awakened yet ; only an occasional few short hoarse chirps are heard as they awaken from a night of dreaming in the treetops before they turn over and go back to sleep .  
Gulls are plump-bodied with a short thick neck , a stout bill with a long hooked upper beak , a round or squared tail and large webs well adapted for swimming .  
But many new immigrants from Taiwan , despite being proven veterans on the fiercely competitive economic battlefield at home and arriving with full coffers and detailed plans for investment , tend to pull up short and halt the troops when they see the business efficiency , market order , rise of labor consciousness , severe labor shortage ( even worse than Taiwan 's ) and high operating costs they must face . . . even if they do n't beat a hasty retreat .  
The agricultural mission not only helps Malawi develop agriculture but also serves our foreign service community there by providing them with fresh produce and playing the role of general jacks-of-all-trades and Mr . Fix-it 's . If the car breaks down , if it has a flat tire , if the screen door 's stuck , if you need some styrofoam or nylon cord for packing , if you 're short a blanket and pillow for a guest . . . just track down a team member and you 're sure to come away satisfied .  
Mahjongg 's compulsive hold over its aficionados can be seen from the following true stories : A typhoon had forced Liu Hsiao-chen to cut short her trip down south , and worriedly she made her way back to Taipei . As she neared home through knee-deep flood water and in the pitch dark of a power blackout her anxiety grew . But stepping in at the door , there were her parents and a couple of neighbors happily engrossed in a game of mahjongg , playing by candlelight and with their feet perched up on stools .  
Applying mental reasoning Chang Shih-tsung is adept at finding lateral links between things , using supporting material and coming up with new deductions . Starting from a rapid-fire " chopstick gun " invented by Taiwanese kids , he began to collect toy weapons from other countries and investigate their construction and performance . From our own history he found a rapid-fire crossbow from the Three Kingdoms Period , and has written a short paper on the subject .  
Explains an experienced naval officer : " Because they are versatile and swift , they can get anywhere nearby within a very short period of time . Stationing them at outer islands increases combat strength throughout the seas around Taiwan . In combination with onshore missiles they amount to a formidable control over the Taiwan Straits . " Whenever there is a fourth-degree alert the missile speedboats are ordered to deploy to outer islands , and when the alert is raised to third-degree they disperse among military harbors , ready for combat at anytime .  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
Now people will think of going to check out Europe . With the improved economic situation in Taiwan , there 's only the language problem , which Leuven has solved by providing the international curriculum . So all at once everyone began coming . " Here he makes a short critique : " Those coming for travel and study - - without clear study objectives , with the aim of adding to what they 've seen and experienced - - are more numerous than those coming in pursuit of scholarship . "  
Poor grades are bad enough - - what they 're even more worried about is that their darling little child , having fallen in with a " mixed crowd " back in the slow learner class , will be led astray on a short path to nowhere : no higher schooling , no steady employment and a life of idleness , dillydallying and shiftlessness . . . .  
Water comes from heaven . " In agricultural societies , things which are filtered out with water are all organic matter that can be broken down and returned to the natural cycle . Thus , in several places in north Taiwan which are relatively short of water , the agricultural irrigation system and the town or village drainage system were linked together , so that water could be circulated and reused , thus saving water resources .  
Despite having been established for only a short time , in the last two " preparatory " years the bicycle R &amp; D center has already come up with sixteen applications for special patents to provide to manufacturers for mass production . Moreover , an even more important breakthrough has been creation of equipment for precise measuring of the mutual tolerance of the bicycle frame and the other parts ( in the past they could only make rough guesses ) , which saves the enterprises the trouble of muddling through for themselves .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
Originally , no lead-containing ingredients were used in the preparation of pa-pao-san . Large amounts of cinnabar were , however , and because cinnabar was expensive and in short supply , some Chinese pharmacists substituted other mineral in-gredients , such as huang-tan ( yellow lead ) or chientan ( red lead or minimum - - the scientific name is lead tetraoxide ) , which are similar to cinnabar in color . The result of this misuse was numerous cases of lead poisoning in newborn infants .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude . After four years of professional baseball , there are still many shortcomings to be urgently addressed . But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .  
Although in the short period that the garden has been open there have been cases of chicken bones being found stuffed into crevices in trees and disposable nappies being picked up in secluded spots , on the whole things have stayed pretty clean .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
Waking from a dream of riches only to be executed , you feel that life is short / Life and death are fated , neither rich nor poor can escape / The seasons change , the sun sets in the west and the water still flows / Where is the general 's horse today , the field is covered with flowers and grass / Life is a lonely boat , day and night the water flows upward / The boat is smashed and repaired / Death brings respite from the affairs of the world .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
Kang Mu-hsiang , who applies sculptural concepts in his carving , attracts customers to his studio with a large picture of himself holding a chisel and a gouge . Tseng Chin-tsai 's sign uses the theme of a swineherd in the old agricultural society and the song " When Will You Return ? " to allude to the inevitability of suffering in human life . Here one can also find pottery studios , a studio producing mainly carvings of horses , and so on . All the color of Sanyi is concentrated in this one short street .  
An unnecessary luxuryIn the early years of the Republic of China , the famous author Lu Hsun , in a short story entitled " The Blessing " ( " Chu Fu " ) , published in his anthology Indecision ( " P'aihuai " ) , satirized a modern youth who scorned the characters of the feudal age , yet longed for " Fuhsing Lou Restaurant 's shark fin simmered in clear broth , a dollar a serving , cheap and tasty - - is it still so cheap ?  
In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
The Ghostbusting Eight Generals " is Sinorama 's final installment in our series on Taiwan 's yi-chen . Our writer , with detailed graphs , exquisite pictures and intriguing text , has brought the past back to us who grew up in Taiwan 's little villages , reminding us of times we were squeezed among the grown-ups as we all watched the members of an " ghostbusting " procession , tall and short , faces covered with frightening paint .  
For instance , the tall and lanky General Hsieh whirls like a white crane spreading its wings opposite the short and stocky General Fan , who squats low and makes monkey-style kungfu movements . " Each of the dancers has a different character , and there is a dialogue between them , " says Chen Li-e , going on to explain that the generals ' movements and positions can be varied flexibly depending on the size of the space in which they perform .  
Inside such a stressful and congested campus , there is one rare space which offers some relief . Students suffering immense pressure can come here , relax and browse ; they can enjoy newspapers , magazines , music , instant noodles , coffee and candied fruit ; they can even take a short nap on the carpeted floor .  
And once they have been admitted , it is difficult to discharge them . Chronic illness includes stroke-induced paralysis , pathological changes to the liver and kidney , and rheumatoid arthritis . Patients with those afflictions can not possibly get well and leave the hospital within a short period of time . As a result , those patients who are actually in urgent need of hospitalization can not find a bed covered by insurance ( ie . , in common rooms with three or more beds ) .  
In the past , depictions of nature often stopped short at the level of hypochondriac moaning . Today we should write slowly and deliberately about our personal , genuine environment , about the full range of phenomena , and we should employ all the different forms of literature . Good works , even works of complete philosophical reflection , will then arise .  
In order to accommodate the living habits of the village 's Saisiyat residents , Wu thought of incorporating the short spirit ceremony into the dance , and with that in mind in 1994 he specially attended the biannual ceremony at Sky Lake , where he taped the entire thing . He also spent time off from work to visit with Saisiyat elders and the parents of the students in order to get a firm grip on the meaning behind the ceremony .  
First , on the basis of Delft 's experience with red stoneware , he improved the kiln design to produce a higher firing temperature and made a hard red stoneware similar to Yixing ware . But sadly this still fell some way short of the pure white porcelain which the elector craved after day and night .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again . The idea of setting up something eternal by a short term effort emphasizes the idea of a panacea . The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
One noteworthy , and rather unexpected thing , is that this clean-room air which is " 1000 times more pure than outside air " - in which even filtrable viruses find it hard to survive-does not make one feel refreshed and energetic . On the contrary , after a short period you feel stifled and dizzy . You really have to admire those women production line workers who spend 12 hours a day in there .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
The black plum ( Prunus mume-also known by other names such as the Japanese flowering apricot ) is a small deciduous tree of the rose family ( Rosaceae ) . Its new shoots are bright green ; the trunk is straight and vertical ; the flower petioles are short .  
The King Car Educational Foundation , whose stated purpose is to promote basic education for children and adolescents , carried out physical examinations on 200 sixth graders at the Hsingan Elementary School , and the results were even more startling . Of the students tested , many fell short of the Ministry of Education 's reference value : 91 percent fell short for muscular endurance , 86 percent for instantaneous force , and 41 percent for cardiopulmonary endurance .  
A little color will make your features more prominent , your skin color better . . . ' " After spending NT $ 1,500 to have her hair cut short and dyed a not very obvious coffee color , she thinks it was expensive , but " the results were pretty good " because " lots of people ca n't tell I had it done . "  
The traditional dress of India is the " sari , " a single sheet of cloth made into a skirt that goes to the ground ; it is both mysterious and graceful . The Philippines , using locally produced palmetto cloth , has crocheted and embroidered shirts . Indonesian " batik , " wax-dyed or hand-dyed , is cool and comfortable ; a sarong around the waist with a short jacket open in the front is comfortable and beautiful .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
Most may remember how , wherever Chiang went , he was always accompanied by burly individuals in casual dress or suits , with short , neatly groomed hair and stern expressions . These were the men everyone referred to simply as the " Chihais , " and their main mission was to assure the personal safety of the head of state 24 hours a day .  
Most observers approved of Siew 's decisive handling of the case as maintaining the team spirit of the cabinet . Though Liao later made a strong statement attacking Siew and Control Yuan President Wang Tso-yung was also critical , the incident was settled in a short time due to Premier Siew 's actions .  
Nevertheless , it was only in the 1990s that homosexual writing really became prominent in literary circles in Taiwan and became a fad . G &amp; L Magazine founder James An points out that in recent years there has been a flurry of Chinese-language homosexual literature . Works of gay literaure have won lucrative prizes in all categories-novels , novellas , and short stories . It is impossible to deny the achievements of this body of work .  
Because of agricultural crops ' short harvesting cycles , there is as yet little alternative to controlling pest outbreaks by the moderate use of pesticides , unless production methods can be changed ; but when transient insect infestations occur in gardens or in woodland-except where " wood borers " such as ghost moths ( family Hepialidae ) or goat moths ( family Cosiidae ) , which are potentially fatal to trees , are involved-forestry experts generally advise against attempting wholesale eradication with pesticides .  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
" Actually , controlling aging does n't mean rejecting aging . It means healthy , successful aging . " Dr . Wang says , " Aging is a natural , gradual , lifelong process . It is not the complete loss of one 's health and beauty within a very short period .  
For being and nonbeing give rise to each other , difficulty and ease complete each other , long and short reveal each other . . . . " This too displays Laozi 's characteristic way of thinking : everything in the manifest world comes in relative and complementary pairs , and human value judgements are mostly born of relativity .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
Wang Anyi 's short story was a trailblazer , because it appeared at a time when communist ideology still held considerable sway in the literary sphere . " Wang feels that there is no need for a writer to play the part of a social scientist and use a novel as a means of criticizing anything . She has always focused on the individual .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich . But this class arose in such a short time period here that it does n't have a well-formed culture of its own , and therefore consumption , which demonstrates that wealth has been acquired , has become its most glaring trademark .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
Chiu Chung-hsien is the principal of Taipei County 's Hsiushan Elementary School , which won four first prizes for ensembles at this year 's provincial competition and one national second prize . Chiu says that because most parents do n't know which schools offer music programs , and those students without musical ability are too intimidated to sign up for the test , about one-half to one-third of those who apply are accepted . In short , it is n't that difficult to get into a program .  
Each week , the segment features three well-developed hunks dressed in swim suits . Following a short conversation between each contestant and the hosts , female audience members approach the stage to place stickers on their favorite choice , and the contestant with the most stickers is declared the winner . The young women are hardly ever shy about flirting with the contestants , seizing the chance to cop a feel of their bare bodies or placing stickers on the more sensitive areas of the male anatomy .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
And so she moved in a short time from perusing a few thin standardized teachers ' guides , to having a muddled understanding of Chinese grammar and history , to introducing China-that vast and distant land-to students who were even more ignorant of it than her . It was no easy feat .  
The function of the garden , where you can chat and exchange ideas , is kind of like the role a museum plays as it attempts to communicate its message to society . The paper museum has already weathered one serious storm in its short existence , and it has proved to be a hardy survivor , organizing a number of outstanding temporary exhibits . There truly is something special about the Su-Ho Memorial Paper Museum . Expect this beautiful gem to be a fixture on Changan East Road for a long time to come !  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
On the other hand , Mu Huai-ling of VGH points out that even when one does go in for a rich feast at the New Year , it is better to eat fish than meat , better to eat lean meat than streaky pork complete with its rind and fat , and better to eat sea cucumber than cholesterol-rich mullet roe or crab eggs ; in short , you ca n't go wrong by cutting down on meat and eating plenty of vegetables , fruit and whole grains .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
Anaphalis nepalensis ( 11 ) ( family Asteraceae ) is a typical Taiwanese alpine plant . It has a short stem , and the whole plant is covered in fluffy hairs and papery round flowers which give it excellent protection against the cold .  
Another writer whose works have won a warm reception in translation is Cheng Ching-wen . According to David Der-wei Wang , chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University , over the past half century Cheng has recorded and carried on the spirit of humanism in Taiwan ; his work is measured and sophisticated , totally different from the unsettled state of modern society . Last year , Cheng won the 1999 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize for the English translation of his collection of short stories entitled Three-Legged Horse .  
During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds . Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time . In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang-sheng and Lin Yen-hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men 's singles .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
Sadly , development is causing the diversity of Taiwan 's wetlands to decline rapidly . Since the banks of the small lake in the Tatun Nature Park in Yangmingshan National Park , formerly overgrown with lush aquatic plants , were tidied up , and visitors released turtles and koi carp there , in a short time the number of dragonfly species in the area has fallen from over 20 to only five or six . Taiwan 's beautiful mountain lakes have also become places where religious believers set animals " free . " Island ecologies are fragile .  
" When the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like Feng Fei-fei , " Wang notes . " Sun Yan Zi fills this need perfectly . " Moreover , she has had the right material , with producer Peter Li providing songs that have individual character but stop short of being avant garde . This has allowed her to stand apart from the pop singers who just blindly follow the marketplace .  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
" The natural environment is always changing . Even if the number of monkeys has been increasing in the short term , there are so many uncertain factors that it is very hard to say that their populations will grow in the long term . " Wu Hai-yin is the first biologist to have written a doctoral thesis about Formosan rock monkeys .  
When the participants boarded the ferry and completed the short hop to Xiamen , it constituted the first cultural exchange between Kinmen and the PRC under the newly established " three mini-links . " It was very gratifying to see the artistic occasion carried off without the slightest hint of political overtones .  
As visitors hurry by on their way from one scenic spot to the next , on the steep slopes they see the patches of Japanese knotweed , stonecrop and spiraea , with little flowers blossoming shyly in all shades of yellow and red ; the dense , short arrow bamboo ; and the Yushan roses heavy with rose hips . But only Lo Liu-chih knows that at little more than arm 's length , the tangled vegetation hides many nests laboriously built by a bird found only in Taiwan .  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
When Taiwanese music fell on hard times , Wen made 11 tours of the island in his white convertible sports car with his four " sisters " in back . Tooling around in the car with his " sisters , " the girls holding guitars and dressed in short red skirts , the five of them looked like the height of cool .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
Chen 's sense of fashion made a deep impression on me the first time we met . Still short of his 40th birthday , he was dressed in a smartly tailored black suit . The collar was turned up , and he looked a bit like the dashing lead in some detective movie . His hair was combed forward and upward , as is very much in style these days .  
Among the intergenerational developments raising eyebrows and causing debate at the time were the following : sons and daughters-in-law unwilling to live with their parents after marriage ; younger women leaving home to earn a wage and thereby shifting power in the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law ; children demanding to make their own decisions about work and marriage ; and the government encouraging three generations to live together under the same roof . In short , the screws were loosening on many of the structures that supported traditional notions about filial piety .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
Several older women , looking indescribably happy , start their hands and feet in perpetual motion , and in a short time the entire area has been completely cleaned , a gas stove has been set up , and vegetables have been washed and chopped . Before you know it , the aroma of fried rice-noodles begins to permeate the clinic site .  
Strolling around the embassy compound , I discover new greenery amidst the flowers and grass , so parched and brittle just a short time before . The green and sour mangoes on the trees have been transformed instantaneously , becoming lusciously red and ripe .  
The Nationalist government 's Taiwan policy at that time was to reverse the Japanization of the island , and shortly after the end of the war it banned the use of Japanese . Authors who wrote in Japanese lost their medium , and the Taiwanese people , most of whom were as yet unfamiliar with Mandarin , became effectively illiterate . In short , the policy wrought cultural havoc on Taiwanese society .  
The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
One experience I will never forget . At Easter , we traveled to the western regions of Queensland . We departed at 4 a.m . and drove past wheat farms , corn farms , crossing a huge broad land , from tall bush to short scrub , from gray-yellow land to bright red . It was fantastic !  
In the space of a few short months , a university student , a high ranking police officer , and a famous university professor chose to jump off high buildings , while an unemployed man committed suicide by igniting a gas canister and a soldier killed himself with charcoal fumes . The numerous suicide cases cast a dark shadow over all of society .  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
When resources were short and a good number of books were forbidden , it was the second-hand book market that helped spread knowledge , and reading was considered more important than collecting . Today there are up to 400,000 new books published a year , so why do people still want to collect old books ? " It 's because the sheer volume of books being published is huge , it 's like a sea of books out there .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless . By contrast , at present only around 40-50 larger sets of photovoltaic panels are installed in Taiwan to generate electricity from the sun 's rays . On public land and buildings , to date the MOEA has completed demonstration systems in only a few locations including the Presidential Palace and the Yushan meteorological observatory . There is also little sign of enthusiasm for installations on ordinary residential buildings .  
Huang Yuan-cheng currently makes a living by selling tea , telling fortunes , and gravesite divination . He was divorced when his daughter was only six months old , yet , in what seems like a short stretch of time , his daughter is ready to start elementary school . Looking back on the many bumps in the road and setbacks he has seen as a single father , Huang still does n't know how he made it this far .  
While education reform is something that countries all over the world are engaged in , Prudence Chu-ing Chou , professor at National Chengchi 's University College of Education , finds it " unprecedented " that Taiwan , with its limited resources as well as inadequate accompanying measures , is pushing ahead with such sweeping education reforms in such a short amount of time .  
Examples include a Gandhara Buddhist statue from India 's Kushan Dynasty , replete with curly locks and Greek-like aquiline noses , as well as a kingly Cambodian Buddha with a cone-like coiffure gathered at the top of its head , a bare torso , and a short fish-tail skirt tied at the waist . The NPM designed the exhibition layout with a walkway flanked by Buddhas between the South Asian and East Asian areas .

Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
In the area of investment , there was already a growing pattern of investment among developing countries However , virtually all private direct foreign investment in the developing world had been concentrated on a short list of middle income countries  
That is why we ask for the unfailing support and backing of the international community , which , we feel , should in the short - , medium - and long-term involve substantial , increased and strengthened technical and financial cooperation . 
In our view , a viable judicial system , supported by an effective civil and police administration , would in the short run assist the Government to put Rwanda back on its feet and enable it to pursue the goals of social and economic development .  
In terms of the international community , the level of financial support has consistently fallen short of requirements .  To a great extent this can be attributed to the economic difficulties experienced by industrialized countries in recent years .  
In short , the draft resolution contains measures that are all comprehensive in nature , but to implement them we need to apply our wholehearted and determined efforts and thus bring this unbelievable human tragedy to a speedy close .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
In short , the Special Rapporteur attaches great importance to the prevention of manifestations of racism in any form whatsoever , through governmental , legislative , administrative , economic and social and , above all , educational measures .  
At every level local , national , regional , international and global there is an awareness that the United Nations , for all its setbacks , is recognized for having done so much , so well and in such a short span of time .  
Despite the fact that primary education has been free and mandatory under the Constitution since the early days of the Republic , there is a sector of our young population that , because of economic and social factors leading to hunger , poverty and social disintegration , is more exposed to marginalization and crime in short , to exclusion .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
Building upon political and economic stability , ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed that contribute to consolidating the opening of our economies , the transparency of our markets , and the growth of commercial exchange with other regions in short , the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a better future for our peoples .  
This is because we are fully aware , as the Summit itself has underscored , that nothing short of a renewed and massive political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
The agenda item entitled Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons has been under consideration for several years in our Commission . For various reasons , the Commission has been unable to formulate a set of satisfactory guidelines for nuclear disarmament , thus falling short of people 's expectations . 
Intensive , short , practical training programmes with emphasis on skills in effective communication , community organization and facilitation of behaviour change should be developed in order to prepare the local personnel of all sectors involved in social development for carrying out their respective roles .  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
Nothing short of a renewed and massive political will , at the national and international level , to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .  
The comprehensive agreement is the only agreement that has been in full force and subject to specific verification for almost a year now , yet the current status of compliance with it - the practical expression of which would be a marked improvement in respect for human rights in Guatemala - stands in stark contrast to and falls far short of what was agreed .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
They stressed that the existing assurances and unilateral declarations fell far short of the credible assurances sought by non-nuclear-weapon States and that , in order to be effective , the assurances should be unconditional , without qualification , not subject to divergent interpretation and unlimited in scope , application and duration . 
An urban strategy for the short and medium term should aim at reducing the large numbers of underemployed currently engaged in the so-called informal sector and low-wage services sector by increasing labour absorption in modern formal industry .  
The budgetary burden will increase in the short and medium terms in connection with the extension of economic and social infrastructures to the rural areas and the unserviced urban periphery and inner-city slums where the poor are living .  
The United Nations needed to be more competitive in the international professional market and the current salary package fell particularly short in respect of nationals from both developed and developing countries who had other options for employment .  
More important , there is a widespread belief among politicians and senior government officials that the adoption of sound environmental practices would result in lower rates of economic growth in the short run , that pollution control would divert scarce resources from more relevant social areas and that it would lead to price increases .  
Although progress towards universal education and literacy has been impressive in recent times , the number of illiterate people will continue to grow and many developing countries are likely to fall short of universal primary education by the year 2000 .  Three main concerns regarding current systems of education may be expressed .  
At the outset of this statement , I should like to express our deepest sympathy to the delegation and Government of France and to the families of the two valiant and honourable members of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) whose valuable lives were cut short at such an early age by the merciless and cold-blooded actions of professional killers , whoever they may be .  
In the short time that has elapsed since the Esquipulas I agreement , Central Americans have almost completely succeeded in containing the political violence that had ravaged several countries in the region ; democracies have been established and transformed ; respect for human rights has been strengthened , and the new regional integration system has been defined . "  
These internally displaced persons have suffered the hardships typical of other refugees and internally displaced persons : they were forced to flee their homes and established community structures at very short notice , unaware of where they were going or how they would end up and having to endure temporary shelter and extremely poor living conditions .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
States should be less restrictive and more liberal in the granting of visas to nationals of countries of the South and call on their populations to be more receptive to foreigners and to cultural interchange .  181 .  In the short term , as the United Nations strives for peace on several fronts , radical measures are urgently needed to curb radio stations that promote ethnic or racial hatred and to suppress clandestine radio stations which engage in such activities .  
NULLAlthough the case of Mexico had several unique features , once the crisis began international securities investors suddenly reassessed their risks in all the emerging market economies : the contagious effect of the Mexican crisis left no developing country untouched in the short term . 
NULL FRITSCHE ( Liechtenstein ) said that her country , through its proposal concerning self-determination , sought to provide a means , short of full independence , whereby the reasonable aspirations of distinct communities within States could find expression through different types of self-administration , ranging , according to the circumstances , from limited self-administration to something approaching internal self-government . 
An initiative put forward by the President of Russia , Mr . Yeltsin , has received broad international backing that is , the initiative on the holding in the spring of 1996 of a summit meeting on issues of nuclear security , to consider pressing problems in this area and define ways to solve them , in both the short and the long term .  
While increasing the number of African States participating in the stand-by arrangements is an ongoing process in the short and medium term , I invite those African States that are already participating to cooperate with the Stand-by Arrangements Management Team to compile a complete picture , by the spring of 1996 , of specialized and heavy equipment needs .  
The bands of Taliban , under the direct control of the Pakistani Government , recently gathered at the outskirts of the capital Kabul and suffered repeated setbacks as a result of the crushing blows by the forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , thus falling short of their heinous plans of taking over the city of Kabul .  
In the interests of increased savings and the successful implementation of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and given the fact that the outcome thus far had fallen short of expectations , his delegation attached great importance to the ongoing efforts of resident coordinators to ensure closer involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions in operational activities , in particular at the field level . 
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
If power politics are allowed to be deployed in the pursuit of exclusive and narrow interests in a climate of confrontation , if the world 's resources are shared on the basis of military power rather than of international treaties and conventions , if priority is not given to international law and international cooperation , and if we attempt to evade the responsibilities that we have all undertaken under the Charter , however appealing and convenient that might appear in the short term , we will sow the seeds of chaos , anarchy and rapid disintegration .  
Although these models have generated deceptive , apparently attractive macroeconomic indicators , in practice they go hand in hand with an increase in poverty , marginalization , environmental degradation , disease , ignorance , social conflict , a loss of national resources and sovereignty in short , with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible underdevelopment .  
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
In the year and a half since the World Summit for Social Development , many countries have made great efforts in implementing the outcome of the Summit at the national level by designating national focal points , formulating short - , medium - and long-term strategies and plans for social development and starting to take appropriate and concrete measures to implement them .  
My country has assumed the responsibility to diminish poverty in the short term through social and economic strategies geared not only towards meeting basic physical needs such as health , nutrition , education and work , but which are also aimed at defending human rights and promoting the equitable distribution of income and wealth .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .

" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
The cease-fire broke down on 29 April when an attempted meeting of the Council of State , attended by Chairman Sankawulo together with Councilmen Taylor and Kromah , was cut short after fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and NPFL / ULIMO-K forces near the executive mansion .

Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
The Mission continued to stress the need to plan the short , medium and long-term phases of this complex process , bearing in mind the political , technical and social implications of the reform .  
Before the astonished eyes of a silent public , we have in recent years been able to " see " the gravest violations of the right to life for ethnic and racial motives , death from hunger in atrocious conditions of thousands upon thousands of children and people of all ages , in short , atrocities that in the old world with less intercommunication only came to be known many years later through books and distant reports , and were sometimes never known at all by the public .  
The Joint Border Commission continues to meet on a regular basis and to focus on resolving the disputed border areas it had previously identified , but the results of its work have thus far fallen short of the expectations and the public statements of intent of the two parties in this regard .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
Debt-relief measures for the least developed countries would help to release scarce resources in order to boost social and human development expenditure and to finance investment in critical economic restructuring in the short term and medium term .  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
However , on a number of occasions the response fell short of the amount required to complete other programmes .  The main projects that still require funding include those on democratic institutions and productive and social reintegration .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
The elements of the ANAD peacekeeping force would be coordinated in predetermined tactical or logistical modules in a state of operational readiness on their respective territories and could be sent into action at short notice .  
Having regard to the major disarmament and non-proliferation conferences already scheduled for the remaining years of the decade and to the need to concentrate scarce resources on specific and focused disarmament events and on goals attainable in the short term , consensus on the timing of another special session on disarmament and broad agreement on its objectives are vital to the prospects of success .  
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
In the first case , the two main groups can be differentiated by appearance , as the Tutsi are long , whereas the Hutu are short ; the Tutsi are handsome , genuine black _ skinned Europeans , while the Hutu are ugly , genuine Negroes .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
At the end of the three-year period , it would be possible to evaluate the degree to which the objectives had been attained and on that basis decide whether work on enterprise development represented an important contribution to development and therefore whether it should form part of the elements presented for ministerial consideration at UNCTAD X . In short , work on an enterprise development strategy must be based on a strategic vision , the elements of the strategy must contribute to growth and development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability , and the strategy must be amenable to evaluation . 
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .

While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
A short but substantive / analytical / factual summary prepared by the Secretariat of the informal consultations of the Security Council should be circulated as an official document of the Council to all Member States the day after such meetings .

When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
Priority is being given , therefore , to establishing links with radio stations worldwide , which will enable instantaneous use of the Departments radio programmes , through the most effective delivery system available in each region or subregion , including short wave , satellite , digital audio , telephone feeds , electronic audio-file transfer and other Internet-based mechanisms .

Seen in relation to the total annual appropriations for ESA programmes and other national programmes , the financial leeway for full implementation of a revised space policywith respect to previous commitments to such programmesis relatively limited , at least in the short term .  
The major policy recommendations in the area of social development include enhanced budgetary allocations for social services , establishment of a formal social fund , targeting of measures related to employment creation , cash transfers , free or subsidized provision of essential goods and services and credit facilities in the short term , introduction of an effective system of unemployment insurance , and revision of development strategies to minimize vulnerability to crises in the future .  
The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
The Office for Civil Affairs , which will be responsible for overseeing and , where necessary , conducting a number of civil affairs functions , such as civil service and economic and budgetary affairs , as well as supporting the restoration and provision , in the short run , of basic public services , such as public health , education , utilities , transport and telecommunications . 
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .

For some , the central piece in the struggle is the reform of the legal system , that is to say , the search for a system that is less arbitrary , less driven by ideology , less cruel towards its dissidents and criminals ; in short a system based on the rule of law built around respect for the personal dignity of all individuals .  
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
The fruit that our peace process has manifestly borne in such a short time provides clear evidence of the validity and relevance of the system and of the fundamental , indispensable and inestimable importance of the efforts of the Guatemalan people within the country and of the unquestionable effectiveness of international friendship in the form of respectful , timely and effective cooperation in building a more democratic country and a more equitable and united world .  
Contrary to the limited internal resources available in the past for pre-reproduction work and heavy-duty binding , a large reproduction capacity has long been available to meet the demand for regular documents prepared for intergovernmental bodies i.e . , technically simple materials that must be produced within strict and short deadlines and in print runs of a few thousand copies .  
In the short to medium term , the productivity , competitiveness and market access of traditional commodity products should be promoted with a view to achieving greater revenue and relative stability in export earnings and the development of a more diversified and dynamic economic base .  
However , key parts of the deterioration ( such as the accumulation in the spring of 1997 by the central bank of Thailand of a large part of the forward exchange liabilities that depleted its net foreign exchange reserves ) may take place during short periods , so that improved disclosure would not necessarily protect the debtor from sudden reactions by creditors and investors which are highly concentrated in time .

The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .  
It would be possible for Equatorial Guinea to ensure , within a reasonably short period , the full realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights for the 450,000 inhabitants living in its territory of 28,000 square kilometres .
