In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .

In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
In light of the " three represents " requirements , party committees at and above the army level fully recognized the extremely great importance of changing the leadership style and getting involved with the masses .

In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .  In this way , the study and implementation of the " three represents " has become a major part of the teaching by positive example in the " three stresses " education .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .

At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
However , in order to bring about a rapid economic growth of the national economy , the developing countries have generally selected the developed areas to implement a special opening up policy to promote further economic development of the developed areas by means of preferential policies and have regarded these areas as growth centers for promoting the overall development of the national economy .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
For example , last year , when discussing the measures for promoting community construction and management , advancing the construction of new and high-tech industrial bases , and reinforcing the party organizations at the grass-roots level , members of the municipal party committee standing committee were dispatched to do special investigations and research in the fields they took charge of .  This guaranteed that the decisions and arrangements made by the municipal party committee more relevant and pertinent in giving guidance to the concrete work .  
In the second half of 1995 , units at the grassroots level of the South China Sea Fleet stationed in the opening area of the special economic zone reflected that the original experience and methods of ideological and political work seemed to be unworkable now .  
The garrison has introduced an external spokesman system and has regularly held Open Day at its barracks with an eye on enhancing understanding or communication between itself and the Hong Kong public .  Practice has shown that the garrison has established fine , harmonious , and mutual-trust army-government relations with the SAR government and has forcefully safeguarded a high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Hong Kong SAR in such a special environment as " One Country , Two Systems " .  
People will not forget that in the autumn of 1997 , the special administrative region government , which had just been set up , faced the impact of the financial crisis that wrecked havoc across Asia . The prices of securities in Hong Kong , whose pillar industries were the financial business and real estate , plummeted and the prices of houses also fell drastically , causing the economy as a whole to decline .  
While people were sighing in despair , the special administration region government took drastic measures on its own initiative to strengthen the linked exchange rate system , drove international speculators out of Hong Kong , and stabilized the securities market and financial market , thus proving the pessimistic predictions of some people to be untrue .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
Meanwhile , " red army " officers and men studied and discovered the countermeasure of sending out reconnaissance troops to attack the " blue army " night monitoring and control system .  In the heat of the battle between the " red " and " blue " sides , a well-equipped special " blue army " unit maneuvered in great secrecy to the " red army " rear camp that was located thousands of li 's away , and sneaked an attack on the rear troop unit .  
We should pay special attention to the use of modern tools of the mass media , such as the press , the radio , the television and the Internet , bring into play their role as the main channel for ideological education , and make continuous efforts to create lively forms that can reach people 's ears , brain and heart .  
Frequent visits by leaders of the two parliaments and their special committees in recent years , as well as the extensive exchanges in legislation , parliamentary cooperation , bilateral ties , and international issues of common concern during these visits , have enhanced mutual understanding and trust .  
Since the second Gulf War , the United States has established its dominant position in the region by promoting the policy of " restraining Iran and Iraq in the east and promoting peace talks in the west " .  It has basically achieved the two set objectives of protecting the security and stability of its special ally Israel in the Middle East region , and ensuring the safe and smooth supply of Middle East oil to the West .  
It is necessary to integrate education with management and punishment .  In view of the special feature that the financial sector has more economic crimes than any other sectors and through the establishment of three defensive lines of ideology , system , and law , the financial sector should coordinate its regular ideological education with strict management and its efforts to strictly crack crimes , so as to form an education-management-crackdown structure .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
" Go ! "  No sooner had the group leader issued an order in a low , deep voice than the " special combat " soldiers set out by crawling out of the green curtain of tall crops .  In the twinkling of an eye , they submerged in the lake .  
The lake was more than 1,000 meters wide between its southern and northern banks .  Though it was by no means difficult for someone carrying nothing to cross the lake , it was indeed far from easy for the " special combat " soldiers , who were each carrying equipment as heavy as or more than 20 kilograms , to do the same .  
In an area where there were high mountains , steep cliffs , long and deep valleys , thick bushes , and ferocious animals , a " special assault group " was faced with a ruthless battle : It had to accurately find a way out by crossing through a primeval forest as deep as 35 kilometers in the pitch-black night within 11 hours without being discovered by the " enemy " forces , who were armed with all types of modern reconnaissance equipment . 
The 11th special assault group encountered a patrol team of the " enemy " after seeing " a flash of light " in an area some 20 kilometers inside the " enemy " defensive zone .  With their night vision devices , the " special combat " soldiers discovered that they had been encircled in a valley less than 100 meters long .  At such a critical moment , the group leader led the group members to tenaciously fight against the " enemy " at close quarters .  
At dawn , this reporter found at the mouth of the mountain , which was known as " Xiyangkou " , that the " special assault group " members , who had engaged in fierce fighting overnight and had broken through a defensive zone guarded closely by the " enemy " forces , which was as long as 35 kilometers , had become exhausted and had bloody cuts on their faces and hands .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
On the battlefield of the Liaoning-Shenyang Camp of the old days , a certain motorized infantry brigade conducted a special live-ammunition practice : Operating tanks , firing antiaircraft guns , and launching missiles , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee operated some 10 authorized main-battle firearms , and not a single shot missed its target ;  
In this regard , Zhang Li proposed that facing the situation of China 's accession to the WTO soon , the educational sector at the government level should take the work of research , exposition , and verification as a matter of great urgency , use the experience of the 40 countries that have joined the education trade agreement for reference , set up a special organ to coordinate pertinent departments , and begin the procedure of making initial preparations .  
Facts have proved that economic operating pattern is the decisive factor of stimulating and attracting talented personnel , and the foundation for bringing up new-type personnel with the special characteristics of having enterprising spirits , competitive awareness , concepts of law and credibility , and professional ethics lies in the market economy .  The WTO is an invisible and powerful pointer as well as the soil for breeding and hastening parturition .  
At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
What warrants our special attention is that the " Proposal " for the first time oriented the " vigorous promotion of the national economy and universal application of information technologies in society " as a " strategic move to embrace the overall construction for modernization " , unequivocally proposing that the " information technology should contribute to industrialization , display its newly emerging superiority , and achieve leaping development in the social productive forces " .  
One special combat soldier filled a pop can with the " eight-treasure porridge " and handed it to me .  I was expecting a lousy taste , but to my surprise , it was a sweetish sour flavor and " tasted super " .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , Xiamen 's gross national product roseby 16.6 percent on an annual average and the city 's GNP and financial revenue also ranked the first among all special economic zones .  
After the reversion , the government of the special administrative region made the solution of social security the primary job under the strong support of the central government and increased the force to hit all crime activities , and had a distinct affect .  
There will be 4% growth in total local productivity ; at the same time , the government of the special administrative region is trying to improve the investment environment progressively and trying to make the economic rules better and more complete .  They are raising the administrative efficiency and opening the cellular phone and web connection markets to strengthen the desire to invest from inside Macao and outside of Macao .  
First of all , the special administrative region seriously exercises the right of administrative management , legislation , and power of final adjudication and right of independent justice that the basic law gives , so the residents of Macao fully enjoy all the freedom and rights of speech , journalism , religion , and forming groups that the basic law rules .  The benefits of the descendent residents of Portugal in Macao are protected according to the law .  Their customs , culture and tradition are respected .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Our special combat platoon and a disguised detachment adopted a tactics of " making a feint to the east and attacking in the west " and " drawing the snake out of its hole " and the deceptive means of setting up fake missile vehicles .  They finally discovered the " devils " on No . 3 Height 20 km away .  After the discovery was reconfirmed with infrared imaging device , laser radar and other surveillance devices , they promptly made an assault .  
After launching a special campaign to crack down on criminal and vicious groups throughout the country , China has successfully destroyed some criminal and vicious groups , cracked down on a large number of major and serious criminal cases , and severely punished many criminals .

The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
Recently , a leading Taiwan official openly claimed that cross-strait transport links are " special international routes " and " the formulation that cross-strait links are domestic routes is absolutely unacceptable , " adding that this has involved the serious issue of so-called " national prestige . "  
On 20 April 2000 , Japan 's House of Representatives approved " Amendment to the Law on Formation of Defense Agency " and decided to set up several new research posts in the Defense Agency , including those for research on nuclear weapons , biological weapons research , and other special weapons as well .  It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Under the leadership of local party committee and government and with the support of the broad masses of the people , public security organs at various places have carried forward the spirit of brave fight and persistent battle , hit hard , moved toward a good beginning of the special target struggle on " hitting the mob and eliminating devils , " and obtained preliminary results .  
For instance , there were no China-made robots 15 years ago , but China has currently developed a group of industrial robots , service-oriented robots , and special robots which are applied to industrial production , work involving high risks , and other businesses .  For example , robots for wall cleaning , pipeline robots , robot-like engineering machinery , contour spraying robots , assembly robots , micro-driving robots , and automatic pathfinders have been on the market for application .  Important achievements have been made with the technique of underwater autonomous deep diving .  
The United States government has , year after year , taken China , a nation with thriving business opportunities , improving daily , and constant improvements in the people 's economy , politics , society and culture , a country where all nationalities come together to construct their own special brand of socialism , and harshly portrayed her as a country where all kinds of rights are exploited , where social order is overturned , a nation which has no path forward .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
Taiwan has a definite advantage in such areas as capital , specialized talents , buying and selling of technologies , enterprise management , and international marketing .  Taiwan businessmen are also blessed with the special advantage of language and ethnicity and thus have many favorable conditions in fighting for a share in the mainland market and in seizing investment and trade opportunities .  
On the other hand , we will encourage and support medium and small enterprises , particularly the science - and technology-based enterprises , to advance in the direction of being " special , refined , unique , new , and intensive , " do a good job of coordination with the large enterprises , and heighten their specialized and socialized level in production .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .

Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
This meeting fully affirmed the results of the special campaign at the previous stage against smuggling , foreign exchange evasion , illegal foreign exchange remittance , and deceptive acquisition of tax reimbursement for export , as well as the joint operation against the law-breaking and criminal activities of producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy commodities ; thoroughly analyzed the severity and harmfulness of existing market economic disorder and the major causes of these problems ; set the principal tasks of rectifying and regulating the market economic order in the next five years and the work focuses this year ;  
The Chinese side has also pointed out that when the surveillance aircraft that caused the trouble flew into the airspace over China 's special economic zone , it should respect the provisions concerning the rights of this coastal country .  This act , which is very unfriendly to China , has seriously threatened China 's national security and severely damaged the consensus reached in May last year between China and the United States on avoiding dangerous military actions at sea .

Moreover , an even more important breakthrough has been creation of equipment for precise measuring of the mutual tolerance of the bicycle frame and the other parts ( in the past they could only make rough guesses ) , which saves the enterprises the trouble of muddling through for themselves .  
But , functionally speaking , the transport capabilities of the electric vehicle simply ca n't compete with the power produced by burning fuel . Thus the electrical version ca n't be widely applied . In fact , it can only be considered for use in special circumstances , as passenger transports for airports , as material transporters in enclosed compounds , or as golf carts , which do not involve long distances or high speeds .  
" Absorbing foreign myths is one of the special features of Chinese culture , " says Cheng Chih - ming , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Theology at Fu Jen University , who studies popular religion in Taiwan . For example there is the male deity Kuan Yin , who transformed into Princess Miaoshan , the beloved daughter of King Miaochuang , after coming to China , and from that transformed into Kuan Yin , the Goddess of Mercy .  
Wang Chen-yi , secretary-general of the Association of Taiwanese Ballads , who has been to the mainland many times , contends that as ko-tzai-hsihas been developing for less than 100 years , it has the special characteristic of being thoroughly plain and simple . For example , singing is done in a natural voice , with the transitions gentle . Movements are smoother , more suave , closer to the style of southerners .  
A woman 's touch in management : One old and respected photographer , who like Chen Li-hung herself graduated from the Toyo School of Photography in Japan , comments that Chen Li-hung 's secret lay in promoting her business by making skilful use of the prestige of studying in Japan , of media advertising and of special offers ; these were ideas that would not even have occurred to many of the less imaginative male photographers .  
What Lin calls " knowing the earth " involves becoming familiar with different geographical environments . High mountains , rivers and marine islands all have their different appearances and their own special types of plants and animals ; tropical , temperate and frigid zones have their own natural conditions that can not be confused .  
After being pulled from the oil , it is golden in color , crispy on the outside and tender inside . Its special flavor is matched with heavy flavorings like hot sauce , garlic , and vinegar . Or you can add some pickled vegetables .  
In addition , when the representative group arrived in Berlin and found that the film festival 's daily publication was quite weighty , with the help of the public relations firm they made broad and friendly connections . Also , taking advantage of the timing , before the first showing of the film they invited important critics to a special preview showing .  
The National Film Archive took the films to a developing company , which gave them an ultrasonic cleaning , repaired the sections that were ripped and falling apart and then used all sorts of special printing machines and chemical techniques to blow up the negatives one frame at a time . Now the films look pretty much like they did back when they were released . All told , in personnel and materials , it cost about NT $ 400,000 to have these films preserved for another 50 years . "  
Before planting 20 million trees : Countries which attach importance to planning prefer to coordinate according to available land resources . For example , when a new residential area was being developed in the Roehampton district of London , it went through detailed planning with the original trees all being kept and protected just as though it were a park . Places such as the special tree-shaded walkway in Berlin , and innumerable other examples , could also be cited .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
Among the 34 special government projects commissioned last year , a total of 274 domestic and foreign patents have been won . That is on average a patent coming out every 1.3 days .  
Lu Nianhua , owner of the Ruby Chinese Restaurant in Paris , left Mainland China and went to work in France at the age of twenty , and only three years later became a restaurant owner . But he says that he did n't have any special secret at all for getting rich quick - - it was all thanks to Wenzhou people 's " magic flute " for whistling up mutual prosperity : the " monthly club . "  
One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever . This special feature combining rich flavors with diverse selection is just the thing for the youthful desire for constant change and novelty .  
The special features of the colored pottery discovered at Yangshao is that it is very lustrous , while the exterior is beautifully sketched with red , black , and white in the shape of subjects found in nature .  
The main harvesting tools included stone sickles , stone knives , and stone shovels . Compared to the earlier Yangshao era , manufacture of stone implements by striking had given way to manufacture by grinding . Some of the more special items include jade axes with carefully and skilfully done animal face designs .  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
" It 's a very technical issue , " explains jade expert Na Chi-liang . The objects of art from every era have their own special characteristics . The gods and animal face patterns of Liangzhu art is similar to the Taotie , a legendary beast often seen in statues of the Shang and Chou dynasties . But upon a more precise comparison , the beast faces of Liangzhu works appear more rustic and simple ; they purvey a feeling of fierceness .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
This is quite different from the sandy beaches characteristic of other parts of the island . Another special feature of the eastern coast is the sharply rising coral reefs and rock platforms . There are many types of colorful channels and caves cut into the coral reefs by erosion .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine . He will still have to be brazen-faced , go up to the counter and explain : " Because of a sudden increase in the high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean , the heavy downfall of rain was prevented from coming down . "  
In the eyes of others , the women of the Hakka - - who are a distinct sub-ethnic group with a distinct dialect - - are renowned for their astounding labor power , diligent and quiet-suffering characters , and genteel and delicate skills . This special way of life and general stereotype that people apply to these women is something molded by centuries and millennia of warfare and chaos .  
Tachen Island is located off the coast of Zhejiang Province . It is a poor and obscure little place whose cuisine is largely limited to seafood . Thus , for example , their " ginger tea noodles " is made with dried fish , shrimp shells , and other seafood fried up with ginger and sesame oil added to the noodles . It 's a special dish that Tachen people give to postpartum mothers to help them regain their strength .  
Some people have criticized Tsui Hark 's Huang Fei-hong as " superficial " and lacking the real martial skills of a great master . The constant use of ropes , of special effects which go beyond the humanly and physically possible , and of speededup action , the all-pervading Chinese popular aesthetic , the dramatic camera angles , the melodramatic dialogues and plot development , create an overall effect which is " very exciting , " but the special qualities of the main character Huang Fei-hong become rather blurred .  
It was hard for Chinese actresses to get parts and those that we did get all depicted stereotyped Chinese women . Even these were in scarce supply . " The way she saw it , for Chinese and American actors alike , a good audition would n't mean you would get the part . You 'd have to rely on that aura you projected , that special something extra .  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
A song sung in the setting sunAfter the X-rated performance had finished , several singers , who were rushed to the locale by special delivery , came onstage and began to sing . The audience simply got bored . Being modern people well versed in the wonders of karaoke , they went onto the stage and entertained themselves , as well as their friends .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
It 's a place of dramatic cliffs and gigantic boulders , where white sand beaches meet grasslands . But more than this , its special geographic location puts it in the middle of the Kuroshio current , which runs from the equator and nurtures coral and tropical fish , making for a beautiful and colorful underwater world .  
Comic books are immediately accessible , because they are direct and have emotional impact . This is one of the special features of the graphic narrative . And they are no different from conventional books - - they can be divided into ones which merely stimulate the senses , and ones which contain deep thought .  
Although they were born attached together , these identical twins share no special sixth sense ; if one wants to find the other , he 'll have to try the pager a few times like everyone else . When the brothers are together , they get even more amicably curious glances . Some people even stop what they are doing for a careful look , as if these passers-by were comparing the young men today with the image engraved on their brains of the two attached infants .  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
Normally such a ritual would not be performed during Ghost Month ( the seventh lunar month ) , out of consideration for the " good brothers " ( " homeless " spirits ) who are only allowed out into the world for this one month every year . But Li Jen-chi consulted Alimu and obtained a special dispensation . she has never doubted Alimu 's power . 12 August , Saturday , weather cloudy with scattered showers .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers . Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
Even if his academic record was n't anything special , he worked to help support his family . He was quick at making chicken cages , and early every morning would wash and shell the dried fava beans that his mother bought at the wholesale market and sold from her front door outside the military dependents ' village . "  
The quality of the performances put on by all these professional and amateur groups and individuals ranges from the appalling to the excellent , and audiences can pick and choose just as at a flea market . Around 10% of the fringe performances are special enough to have a chance of returning in a few years ' time as part of the official program .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
At 6:30 the actors started causing a loud commotion to drum up attention . Two actors , playing familiar slapstick roles from television , spoke together in Taiwanese and explained the special symbolic gestures in the Peking opera Picking up a Jade Bracelet , such as sewing with needle and thread , feeding chickens , and straddling the threshold . By seven o'clock , the temple square was already packed with curious spectators , watching the opera and following the explanations rolling across the electronic sign on the stage .  
Sam Wen says that the current crop of pro players , when youths in the 1970s , ran all around the world for international competitions , bearing the burden of national pride and struggling for medals . Their growth process was somewhat distorted , leaving them with many habits such as enjoying special privileges , wanting advantages , and having a little too much self-admiration . The players must of course work harder at growing up .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
This type of technology does n't require the user to have any special input-output devices to block out the real environment . Instead it employs the so-called " blueboard technique " using cameras . It makes a composite of images shot of the user along with computer generated virtual world images so that people can see themselves acting within the setting on the screen . One use for this is already visible in the weather programs of Taiwan 's three main TV stations .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Anyone holding an outdoor activity in rainy northern Taiwan has to depend on fate to make any money . So the main reason for choosing Taoyuan for the inauguration was the venue 's special feature : The transparent " sky tent " that can keep out the elements while allowing natural sunlight in , thus insuring that the event would not be rained out or blown off course .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Wu was ahead of her at school , so she has witnessed his long-term development . Back in school , Wu was a well-behaved child with a special classical quality to him . Then Chung saw him dancing in a loin cloth for the Cloud Gate Dance Theater , establishing the experimental Contemporary Legend Theater , and acting in movies and on television . His creative ability and experience made her feel that he was the best choice for Ah-Q .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
She continued to explain that the six holes in the shoes that monks and nuns wear represent planting one 's feet on solid ground , and seeing through the vanity of human desires . Their clothing varies according to region . For convenience , some wear long frocks ; others wear robes that leave the right shoulder bare , demonstrating sincerity . There are also special rules for getting dressed : Keep your whole body erect and look straight ahead ; only your hands can move .  
Besides all this hardware , the pedagogical methods carefully maintain an overall appearance : The lecture is written by a panel of experts . There are special instructors to correct test papers and essays . Students sign in with magnetized cards , and automated telephone inquiry systems are available so that parents can immediately know whether their children are absent from class . Test reports are graded by computer , so students can know their progress as soon as they have finished their test .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
While the rates of adjustment varied , they could be as high as 100% - for example , the fee for " partial liver removal " was raised from NT $ 4000-plus to NT $ 8000-plus . As for complaints by surgeons that they are " low-wage labor , " Parng states that in the future the main focus of adjustments in universal health insurance pay schedules will be on respecting doctors ' special skills .  
People are often bedazzled by the earth-shaking " sacrifices " of romantic love , but Ko believes that classical love , which " succeeds " by day-to-day effort , morning and night , is even more special . This is the deep and subtle spirit of " joy without excess . " Perhaps this is why in the West there is the saying , " marriage is the tomb of love , " whereas the Chinese , in a society built on the Confucian moral code , feel that " marriage is the beginning of love . "  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
However , as in the example of author Lin Ching-hsuen , people are often wrongly categorized based on these test results , and more and more doubts are being cast on this type of testing . This has been particularly true in recent years with Taiwan 's active promotion of special gifted and talented programs . Because such a large proportion of gifted students are chosen based on IQ tests , the question of the practicality and fairness of such measures has stirred up a great deal of controversy .  
Protectors of the land When the million or so hikers who climb Taiwan 's mountains each year tramp out of the dark cypress forests onto the open ridges , what meets their eyes is always verdant pines . " In shady , damp places , pine trees can not compete with the tall cypresses , but where there is ample sunlight , it is the pines which thrive . The pine woods have their own special scenery which puts you in a more cheerful mood , " describes one mountaineer .  
As the sun sets in Kaohsiung County 's Yanchao Township , the Chinan Highway is bathed in the yellow twilight . Just out of school for the day , junior high school student A-Mo trudges along the straight line of the road , with an inexpressible desire in his heart : to return to a very special home-a freestanding red-brick building with a sloping roof , where the front yard is an expanse of green grass , and the back yard boasts a basketball court .  
Not enough to go around " Although halfway houses can not completely replace the juvenile detention facilities , they can provide the authorities with another option in handling youthful offenders , " says legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , who is very familiar with the juvenile justice system . Halfway houses are like a sickbed , and jails are like the intensive care unit : " Those who are n't as seriously ill can just rest in a sickbed , but the dangerous cases need special treatment . "  
Kuo , who has designed many of the trails in the Taipei vicinity , emphasizes that Taiwan is very special . It is at the juncture of tropical and sub-tropical climatic regions , with high temperatures and heavy rains year round . Moreover , given its mountainous terrain , all the forest forms of the northern hemisphere are here , layered one on top of the other .  
In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
" She 's a very special person , " says Li Huan-hsin , general manager of E . Excel 's Taiwan branch .

Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
Without a degree , they ca n't become teachers . And the special coaching program has been discontinued . Many weightlifting instructors at the primary level are serving in the guise of " substitute teachers .

The grandfather of the group feels that traditional puppet theater is rich in meaning , and it is a shame no one wants to learn it today . But , he also has praise for high-tech special effects that have light rays blasting out of the characters ' hands , calling them electrifying and progressive .  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
Education Reform Group Institute director Ting Chih-jen , who is currently writing a primary-school social studies textbook for a private-sector publishing company , says that textbooks have always been treated as " bibles " by schools , so the figures chosen for inclusion in them seem to acquire a special aura . Unless one can find people who are universally esteemed , one is apt to be lambasted for including one but omitting another , or one 's choices may be praised by some but opposed by others . Thus the whole thing becomes a thankless task .  
The brutal murder of an ordinary postgraduate student at a prestigious university , in a research institute building with access restricted by the use of a magnetic card reader , shocked the public and aroused the special concern of the police .  
Everyone makes their own special contributions . By combining our resources , our lives and activities have become much more varied , " Wang says .

The result is an impressive newsletter that is a major resource for keeping people informed and for building a sense of cohesion within the community .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
Last year she held a show in the Huashan special economic zone and , even though the exhibition hall was in a state of near-collapse and filled with the smoke of mosquito coils , she still managed to create a romantic , tranquil and elegant atmosphere which was , indeed , a crowning achievement .  
A special feature of aboriginal pottery is its imperfectly circular shape , which results from being produced by hand rather than formed on a potter 's wheel . A lump of pounded clay is made into the vessel 's base , then beaten into shape using an egg-shaped stone and wooden paddle .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
Competitors were judged according to very rigorous standards . The head had to be kept centered , shoulders low , elbows down , arms loose , fingers extended , the breath drawn from the abdomen rather than the chest , etc .

In addition to leg lift , fist form , step form , palm form , fluidity , and coordination , the competitors were also judged on style and rhythm .  
Amidst the hasty passage of the amendments , a provision allowing private gambling , long supported by a certain group of legislators , was attached to and passed along with the regulations .

"  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
The function of the garden , where you can chat and exchange ideas , is kind of like the role a museum plays as it attempts to communicate its message to society . The paper museum has already weathered one serious storm in its short existence , and it has proved to be a hardy survivor , organizing a number of outstanding temporary exhibits . There truly is something special about the Su-Ho Memorial Paper Museum . Expect this beautiful gem to be a fixture on Changan East Road for a long time to come !  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
G-Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water-soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface . Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time .

But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
The gifted students were assigned to normal classes , and it was only for math that they came together for a special class . Yet their math teacher felt that they still needed to go deeper and cover more ground . The math covered at school simply was n't enough , so they all enrolled in supplementary " cram school " classes as well . Mrs . Liu realized that the joint entrance exam questions got easier every year and that thus the essay might be the section that would determine her daughter 's fate .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates . Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands ( Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu ) and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .  
The team for the rice genome project includes : Chen Ching-san , who has long experience in rice research and special expertise in the fields of genetic engineering , molecular biology and biochemical analysis ; Chou Teh-yuan and Hsing Yue-ie , also experienced in rice research and particularly strong in sequencing analysis ; Wu Hong-pan , an expert on rice genetics and computer analysis ; and institute director Shaw Jie-fu , who is distinguished for his work on plant gene functions .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
By the same token , monasteries do not sell recordings of the special music used to help hungry ghosts cross the threshold from hell during Ghost Month , the seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar . Playing such music at random could well result in hungry ghosts emerging from hell only to find that no food and alms await them-thus defeating the charitable object of the exercise and pointlessly bothering the ghosts .  
When you first enter the Taipei Sea World , inside the large tank , visible through the transparent glass , sea creatures of brilliant colors and strange movements meander through the blue water . Recent special exhibitions have featured the delicate , translucent Clione lima-cina ( known variously as the sea angel , sea butterfly , and " angel of the floating ice " ) from the North Pole , and the awesome giant northern sea octopus . The aquari-um 's undersea tunnel makes visitors feel even more that they have entered another world .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
Not long after coming to Taiwan , Ho prepared a study entitled " Developing Organization behind Enemy Lines and Establishing Intangible Bases , " and sent it to Chiang Ching-kuo . Ho was summoned to meet with Chiang , and as a consequence was allowed to enter the army academy , from which he graduated ( in Class 20 ) at the " ripe old age " of 39 . But he did not enjoy any further special successes in his military career .  
Fish noodles are a special type of noodle particular to China 's southeast coastal region . They are made from four parts cornstarch and six parts eel , drum , and other high-grade fish . The mass is then rolled , pressed , cut , and dried in the sun .  
We decided to devote our special feature this month to the investments of Taiwanese businesses in mainland China , with which Taiwan has enjoyed annual trade surpluses of well over US $ 20 billion in recent years . We focus especially on the question of why Taiwanese high-tech manufacturers are moving offshore , and how they manage to keep afloat in the fiercely competitive market of the greater Shanghai region .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
I found the most recent issue of Sinorama , with its reports on the special local character of places like Tungkang , Meinung , Chiaotou , and Linpien , very refreshing . The reports were very touching , and much more thoughtful than the usual tour book blurbs . This is the kind of reporting that is really lacking in our society today , and offers a sense of intimacy that Taiwanese readers abroad can really appreciate .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
Her husband Li Chung-sheng , who was very accomplished at a wide range of Taiwanese Opera roles , died on stage when the gunpowder he was using for special stage effects accidentally exploded in his face . Sai herself later got into political hot water . Branded as a " capitalist roader , " she was thrown into jail for several months .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
The New Year vacation recently over , the flourishing Taiwan publishing industry rolled up its sleeves in eager anticipation and prepared to put its best foot forward for the tenth annual Taipei International Book Exhibit ( TIBE ) scheduled for February 19-24 . Many book lovers were hoping to take advantage of the exhibit as the various publishing houses came together in one place and promoted special discount sales for books to be sold during the last four days of the six-day event .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes . " How can it not have abundant stories , emotions , conflicts , dreams and all the sweet , sour , bitter and hot that make up people 's lives ? "  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
As Li Chen-ching explains , the MOE has decided this year to begin a special program for developing short-term researchers in key technology areas . Thirty-five spots will be funded for doctoral candidates recommended by their universities to go abroad to do research in 12 key areas-including nanotechnology , biotechnology , computer science , and microelectronics-for one year . Students need only have their application accepted , and they will be exempted from the normal exams for government scholarships .  
Today , it 's nothing special to have the chance to go overseas to study , and a more diversified value system has overturned the previous tradition of invariably studying in the US . The opening up of travel for the purpose of tourism has also allowed many people from different social strata to have the ability to experience foreign cultures .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
In the past , except for special industry databases , sources such as online news sites and all kinds of personal web pages provided an endless wealth of freely accessible information for people browsing the web , leaving little room for the survival of commercial web sites . Even portal sites such as Yam , and Yahoo 's Taiwan subsidiary Kimo , which claimed to have millions of subscribers , were frustrated by their lack of an " excuse " to charge fees .  
In the visual media kingdom of the US , in the past few years revenue from productions that include animation and digital special effects has exceeded that from films shot frame by frame on celluloid in the traditional manner , and in Japan , computer games outstrip the automobile industry in sales value , showing remarkable popularity despite the stagnant economy .  
To achieve this , CGCG has specially developed a production management system that breaks down the tasks involved in producing each scene into different categories . Designers are responsible for designing the characters , animators are responsible for adding movements , and other processes such as adding color , lighting and special effects are also handled by specialists . All these tasks are conducted simultaneously to reduce the amount of time needed to complete the project .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
Intersexuals ( also known as hermaphrodites ) are people who were born with two sets of sexual organs . They have chromosomal abnormalities or hormonal imbalances and are not transsexuals . People who adopt a persona of the opposite sex for a special reason , such as Mulan ( who took her father 's place in the army ) or the transvestites who change their sex to make a living , can not be counted as true transsexuals .  
At the end of June , the Executive Yuan established a special team to outline financial reforms . Invoking existing banking laws , the Ministry of Finance announced a tiered management policy for the credit departments of farmers ' and fishermen 's associations . The goal was to follow up on the August 2001 partial intervention ( in which a special fund was used to take over and restructure 36 of the worst-run ones ) by tackling the widespread problem of unrepaid loans at these credit institutions , to protect farmers ' real interests .  
For unemployment problems of this magnitude , it is unlikely that extraordinary legislative measures will solve the problem overnight . At the end of December 2002 , the total budget was thoroughly examined . Why is n't a long-term employment bill being channeled into normal budgetary policy ? And why was a special budget suddenly rushed through ?  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
This year marked a special innovation for Pinghsi 's Sky Lantern Festival , as Western Valentine 's Day fell between the Lord of Heaven celebration on the ninth day of the first lunar month and the traditional Lantern Festival on the fifteenth . Pinghsi expanded its Sky Lantern Festival into a carnival embracing all three .  
In addition , to cope with competition from low-priced imported rice resulting from Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization , beginning in 2002 Wufeng began cooperating with an agricultural research station of the Council of Agriculture ( COA ) to promote the use of Tainong 71 " Yi-chuan fragrant rice . " This variety , developed by Dr . Kuo Yi-chuan , has round and robust grains , and when cooked gives off a special taro fragrance .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
" I graduated second to last of my whole elementary school , " Lu explains . " My sister was my homeroom teacher during my first year in junior high . She felt that I learned too slowly , so she had me sent to the special education class . It took me four years to graduate from middle school , and because I could n't pass the high school entrance exam , I went to vocational school .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
Pots made from blackish ash-colored clay are also few in number , but they too have some special characteristics . The jars and vases have small mouths and big bellies . The material is of very fine quality and the exterior surfaces have undergone smoothing and polishing . There are broken lines and circles on the exterior surfaces of the " shoulder " portion , and these decorative line patterns normally encircle the outside of the vessel .  
They improvised and created as they progressed , though they modestly refuse to claim any great brilliance about the whole thing : " It 's just the basic instinct for working with your hands that most people who grow up on the farm have . " But there is something special about the work of these hardy rural folk . In comparison with the trite , commonplace nature of bamboo facades that you can see all over the place , there is a touching rustic charm to the Grass Academy .  
" To be designated a historic site , a building must be a repository of excellent stories , " observes Yu Chao-ching . " Otherwise , its architectural workmanship must be remarkable . Its character , special qualities and worth must first be understood . " Yu points out that successful architectural preservation is a process of constant change-of preserving what is good in a site , and then adding new good things to it .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
Vincent Hsieh , the chief operations officer ( COO ) at PC Home Online , which crossed over into online marketing three years ago , says that SARS definitely boosted Internet sales of things like surgical masks , thermometers , disinfectant , and air purifiers . But he also suggests that the Internet succeeds mainly because of its special characteristics-speed and suitability for new and unusual products . Therefore he thinks that online selling is attractive enough in itself that it will not experience any sharp falloff now that the epidemic is over .  
This has been especially noteworthy since the former state-run telephone company became Chung Hwa Telecom and began operating as a private enterprise , driving competition in the broadband Internet access market . This market has become very competitive , with operators offering special deals and unlimited access , thereby greatly contributing to the increase in e-commerce activity .  
Unlike Hsinchu 's experimental primary and middle schools , which are under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Yuan 's National Science Council , STSIP 's public primary and middle schools are covered by the Tainan County Bureau of Education , and are ranked at the same level as all public primaries , enjoying no special privileges .  
The 2003 Asia-Pacific Arts Forum marked another step in cooperation between the Council for Cultural Affairs ( CCA ) and NTUA , following on the 2000 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Forum . The Arts Forum , specially coordinated with the CCA 's 2003 " Creative Culture Industry Year , " devoted special attention to culture not only as an end in itself but also as an economic activity . It aimed to encourage discussion about the common problems facing the development of indigenous cultures and cultural industries in the Asia-Pacific region .  
Once while driving through the Yangmingshan mountains north of Taipei he happened across a big field of calla lilies shrouded in thick morning fog , and was inspired to study up on flowers . His studies once prompted him to make a special trip in the middle of the night to Tienwei Rural Township in Changhua County to watch the flower farmers carefully tending to their daisies by the light of electric bulbs .  
Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
In the next two years competition heated up as more people joined the industry . To find some special tools to give him an edge , Kung headed to Hong Kong . On his trip , he came across a kind of carved gourd known as an " egg gourd " in a department store . This egg gourd , so named for its size and shape , was a magnificent work of skill and beauty , and enraptured him .  
The groups he leads typically have " free time " scheduled for half a day or a full day so as to allow his charges to deeply experience and probe nature . " The special quality of ecotourism lies in its leisureliness , " stresses Chen Chang-po . When the travel itinerary is too tight , it fosters anxiety among the tourists and tour operators . Only when the mood is relaxed can one discard the pressures and cares of work and everyday life and allow one 's heart and mind to converse with and reconnect to nature .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
" Hard " thinking , based on military aggression and economic hegemony , has long dominated the fate and historical development of mankind , several times leading the world to the brink of extinction . Therefore Lu placed special emphasis on the spirit of cooperation and sharing , on " soft thinking " that can lead to win-win situations , pluralism , and mutual coexistence and prosperity . She urged that the Pacific be managed as a " soft ocean " of sustainable development .  
" Back in the 1960s and 1970s , increasing food production was an important target of economic planning , " says former Council of Agriculture chairman Peng Tso-kwei . Developing mountain and marine food sources and developing marginal land were central to achieving this objective . The government even established a special Bureau of Mountain Agriculture and Animal Husbandry , as well as another agency to develop land reclaimed from the sea .  
" Holding the Chinese Food Week on the very day as Chinese President Jiang Zemin finished a successful visit to Latvia has a special meaning , which will give more local people and guests to Riga a chance to have delicious Chinese food and learn the Chinese culinary culture , " said Carl Mains , general manager of the hotel on the opening ceremony of the Food Week .  
He said that the central government has always attached importance to the role of overseas Chinese , who are patriotic and have deep feelings for the motherland They have played a special role in pushing forward the motherland 's economic development , supporting the disaster relief work and promoting the reunification of the motherland  
ji made specific explanations on the relations between the central authorities and the macao special administrative region , basic rights and obligations of macao residents , the political system , and economic , cultural and social affairs stipulated in the draft basic law of the macao special administrative region  
located to the east of tian'anmen square , the museum of chinese history is the first national museum in china with exhibition halls of 8,000 square meters besides the regular exhibition of chinese comprehensive history , special exhibitions on various subjects are often held at the museum  
In this connection , special reference may be made to the Cooperation Agreement concluded on 9 October 1990 , which provided for mutual cooperation in all fields : political , economic and social , scientific and cultural .  
Our Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , also deserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless efforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and just and sustained by an equitable economic order .  
At the initial stage , in particular , special attention needs to be focused on culturally sensitive instruction that will result in effective communication skills and maximum independence for people who are deaf or deaf / blind .  
He was aware that the United Nations and certain of its organs had specific needs , such as peacekeeping and humanitarian activities , and considered that special statutory provisions should be applied in those cases .  
At the initial stage , in particular , special attention needs to be focused on culturally sensitive instruction that will result in effective communication skills and maximum independence for people who are deaf or deaf / blind .  
The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
Fuller consideration must also be given to tapping the surplus rural female workforce within economic development , paying special attention to developing township enterprises that are suitable for women , while ensuring good and safe working conditions .  
ACC strongly believes that in the main , and excepting a handful of spectacular emergency cases or where special mandates have been established , the primary role of the resident coordinator as a development professional remains essential .  
The lack of available required cash has also resulted in the occasional temporary borrowing of any temporary excess cash in special peacekeeping accounts to meet the daily operational requirements of those peacekeeping operations with deficits .  
UNHCR undertakes special programmes to protect women and children from sexual violence , abduction , military recruitment , irregular adoption and other forms of threatening and humiliating treatment that may lead to permanent trauma and social breakdown .  
Consideration should be given to supplementary food allowance where , because of special local conditions , the standard daily allowance of 1,000 riels per prisoner is not adequate to secure a proper nutritious diet ;  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
The Holy See approved of the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , which is an expression of the international community 's commitment to fighting violations of human rights , and it expressed its support by making a symbolic contribution to the special fund established by the Secretary-General to finance the activities of the Tribunal .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
In addition to improving the living conditions of thousands of special hardship and other impoverished families , the shelter rehabilitation programme sought to create employment in local construction sectors and to promote refugee self-help by soliciting volunteer labour from beneficiary families in return for provision of materials .  
Previously , the regular programme was divided into three parts : the General Fund per se , funded ongoing activities ( items originally in the General Fund that had received special funding ) and capital and special projects ( investments required to expand and improve the Agency 's capital facilities , and ongoing activities which had received special funding yet which were not part of the Agency 's core activities ) .  
Further , the Assistant Secretary-General noted that the problems produced by rapid urbanization could not be solved by a single level of government ; it required close collaboration between all levels of government and the entire spectrum of civil society .  Of special importance were local authorities , and in that connection , the Assistant Secretary-General made reference to the recently signed " Protocol of Lisbon " between the Centre and prominent international local-government associations .  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
The difficulties involved in meeting , living together and working as equals in an atmosphere of tolerance and cooperation can not conceal the important contribution being made today by the leaders of that Republic under the inspiring leadership of President Mandela , to whom we wish to accord a special recognition for having constructed the democratic foundations of a multiracial and multicultural nation , fully incorporated into the international community . 
As representatives are well aware , the Economic Cooperation Organization is a major regional grouping devoted to the socioeconomic well-being of its 10 member States located in a region of special geo-strategic importance encompassing more than 7-million square kilometres and inhabited by nearly 300-million people .  
In this year in which we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , I would like to lay particular emphasis upon the extremely special nature of this regular contact , an exemplary expression of the close collaboration that should unite the principal organs of the United Nations as they strive to attain the purposes of the Organization .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
My proposal to the Assembly is to create an international United Nations fair-play prize to be awarded every year to the student athlete who , in the judgement of a special committee , has acted most in a spirit of generosity and solidarity with his or her team-mates and competitors and demonstrated the true meaning of fair play in student sporting events throughout the year . 
The Acting President : This morning , the General Assembly will , in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 , devote a special commemorative plenary meeting at its fiftieth session to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance , under sub-item ( b ) of agenda item 112 , Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
In this connection , we are continuing at the State level to formulate plans to minimize the consequences of the accident at Chernobyl improving living standards , increasing medical services and implementing special measures to lower radiation levels in the population with a view to removing limitations on peoples ' lives and activities in the contaminated regions .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for a concerted response from the international community to deal in a more effective manner with the special economic problems of the affected States , I would like to introduce the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 32 , entitled Economic assistance to States affected by the implementation of the Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) .  
Sudan 's multidimensional cooperation with the international community as represented by the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations in ensuring the flow of humanitarian assistance has been the subject of special appreciation by the United Nations as demonstrated in General Assembly resolutions and in the Secretary-General 's report which underscores the success of OLS in assisting all the needy .  
The delegation of Madagascar takes this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General on his concise and accurate report on the special geographical conditions in Madagascar and this region of the Indian Ocean , which is continually exposed to the ravages of tropical cyclones and to the widespread damage caused by these natural disasters .  
Therefore , in that regard , my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee , given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee 's work is progressive , innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social , economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration , and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
At the international level , it was agreed to focus attention on and support the special needs of countries and regions in which there are substantial concentrations of people living in poverty and which , therefore , face serious difficulties in achieving social and economic development .  
The report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 50 / 291 and the special meeting of the First Committee as well as other events traditionally held in observance of Disarmament Week have once again proven that the international community continues to rely on Disarmament Week as an appropriate occasion for further promoting national and international activities to educate and inform the public about major disarmament issues and developments .  
Garc \ x { 71f0 } ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In view of the positive changes that have recently taken place internationally the relaxation of tensions at the global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among nations the way has been paved for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
The international community therefore has a special responsibility to check and curb these illicit arms transfers as a matter of the highest priority , as terrorism has emerged as the principal public enemy , often transcending national boundaries and threatening to tear apart the very fabric of civil society . 
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
While the countries with the largest and most sophisticated nuclear and conventional arsenals have concluded some treaties on nuclear disarmament , it must be emphasized , however , that they have a special responsibility for disarmament and should make further efforts to implement those treaties in earnest so as to bring about further drastic cuts in their nuclear armaments .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .

Nationally determined policies for integrated and multifaceted programmes , with special attention to women , to the poorest people living in critical areas and to other vulnerable groups should be implemented , ensuring the involvement of groups with a special potential to act as agents for change and sustainable development .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .

Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .  
Calls upon all Afghans , especially the leaders of warring parties , to agree on an immediate cease-fire and a speedy transfer of power and to support the special mission 's efforts to facilitate national reconstruction , expedite the process leading to the speedy establishment of an acceptable transitional government and restore a fully representative and broad-based government for Afghanistan ;

In specific cases , the inclusion of special modules has been accompanied by the redesign of the basic questionnaire or at least parts of it , with the objective of continuing to adapt to changing conditions by incorporating improved techniques of research , and of perfecting the investigation of specific variables .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
Ms . AYKOR , referring to the special temporary measures outlined in paragraph 90 of the report , made the general observation that despite those measures of positive discrimination , the status of individual women continued to be determined by traditional and cultural attitudes .

The senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Uzbekistan , supporting the efforts of the leadership of Tajikistan to carry out democratic reforms , stressed the special importance in that connection of the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the need for them to be held in accordance with democratic norms , on a multiparty basis , and to ensure the widest possible participation of the various political forces .  
It is expected that the regional intergovernmental workshops planned in preparation for a proposed world conference on sustainable mountain development in 1997 ( see para . 75 below ) will alert Governments and national agencies to the needs and potential for special national mountain agendas .  
One of the main difficulties encountered so far is the lack of adequate recognition of mountain areas as something special , with common problems not shared by lowlands , and therefore worthy of special attention .  The fragility of mountain ecosystems and the adverse impact of the degradation of those ecosystems on lowland populations have not been fully appreciated .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .

Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;

Calls upon the international community , particularly developed countries and international organizations , to fulfil all their commitments as affirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular on the effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to enable those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 15 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to elaborate his proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly and summit-level meetings of a representative character , on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
this connection , it is understood that the Trust Fund referred to in operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution could be used for payment of a daily subsistence allowance to the aforementioned representative from each least developed country attending the special session , in line with the practice applied under the terms of section XII of Assembly resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , with respect to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .

Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit-transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Also requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to continue its special role in the field of trade and environment , including analytical and empirical work , conceptual and empirical studies , policy analysis , and consensus-building , with a view to ensuring transparency and coherence in making environmental and trade policies mutually supportive , taking into account the need for continuing close cooperation and complementarity in the work of the Conference , the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Trade Organization ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Also invites the international community to make substantial contributions to the special trust fund established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in order to facilitate the preparations for and holding of the World Food Summit as well as to facilitate the full and effective participation of representatives of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , both at the preparatory meetings for the Summit to be held in January and September 1996 and at the Summit itself ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
special concern , in this regard , has been the need to determine the full extent of Iraq 's programmes and to seek verification of Iraq 's claims to have destroyed all proscribed weapons , in particular its stocks of agent VX and its precursors , operational missile systems , all of its biological warfare agent and all of the aerial bombs and missile warheads that Iraq states it filled with various chemical and biological agents in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War .  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
In this forum I will limit myself to recalling the significant role of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the natural and constructive approach he had towards existing problems in the African continent , as well as his personal commitment towards charitable organizations with the purpose of raising funds for special social and development projects and programmes .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
The surge in media and public interest during the fiftieth anniversary resulted in the Department 's tripling its production of backgrounders , fact-sheets , notes for speakers and special radio and television programmes , all of which were transmitted through pouch and electronic means to specific audiences worldwide .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
Belize has proposed that we should establish an annual special session of this Assembly immediately prior to the general debate , at which we would discuss development policy and regenerate the political will necessary continually to revise the complex Agenda for Development and the commitments made in this Assembly , as well as at the high-level global conferences of this last decade of the twentieth century .  
Faced with the threat to mankind posed by the rise in sea levels , global warming , creeping desertification and the disappearance of biological diversity , Benin attaches the utmost importance to implementation of all the agreements reached in Rio and , here , renews its commitment to doing all it can to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly planned for June 1997 to strengthen implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Earth Summit contained in Agenda 21 .  
Now that Eritrea has withdrawn its forces from the island of Hanish af-Saghir and the crisis has passed , we would like to express our thanks and appreciation for the role played and efforts made by France and its special envoy , and the positions of the Secretary-General and the President and members of the Security Council , and to all those fraternal and friendly States that declared their support for the principles agreed upon for resolving the conflict peacefully through arbitration . 
If it is first and foremost up to the African countries to demonstrate that their marginalization is determined only by fate and that their current situation is merely one of those tragic aftermaths with which history has frequently sprinkled the course of human events , then it is also up to the international community as a whole , in active solidarity , to make a special commitment to supporting the efforts of the African countries to deal with the challenges before them .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
My delegation therefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing discussions at the current meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a special fund aimed at considerably reducing the multilateral debt of poor countries under structural adjustment result in a successful outcome .  
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
Although southern Africa today enjoys relative peace and stability , it will continue to need special assistance in order to address the problems of reconstruction and development of the economic , physical and social infrastructures which were destroyed or adversely affected by many years of war and racial injustice . 
I should also like to express my special appreciation for the enlightened and committed leadership of your predecessor , Mr . Freitas do Amaral , who , in the course of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly , made an undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the United Nations .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
Thus , we are in no way , and to no degree , inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound reflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing States particularly those in the Caribbean region , where prominent among the features characterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present vulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread devastation resulting therefrom .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
The delegation of Ukraine considers that the issue of special economic assistance to countries affected by the sanctions regime should remain on the agenda of the United Nations , taking into account the fact that the previous resolutions on the issue have not been duly implemented , at least with respect to my country , which has not received adequate assistance to cover the tremendous losses caused by its strict and consistent observance of the sanctions regime .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Of special significance to my country , and a point we had emphasized in our own presentation to the Court , was the unanimous finding that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session . 
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
But what is more important in the institutional and mechanism frameworks is that the first special session gave the United Nations , and especially the General Assembly , its primary deliberative body , a key role to play in disarmament and greater responsibility in the process of seeking general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
This fourth special session will provide an opportunity to review the question of the comprehensive programme of disarmament , and will allow us to reconsider objectively the impressive architecture contained in the Final Document of the first special session devoted to disarmament , without diverting us from the priorities we collectively established in 1978 .  
We feel that all the working papers submitted and statements made demonstrate the necessity of providing any eventual fourth special session with real and pragmatic content ; otherwise , we will merely be repeating a sterile exercise which , because of its content , would not enjoy consensus among the members of the international community .  
His treatment of the subject of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ( SSOD IV ) integrated well the range of positions held by delegations , further spelt out in thoughtful papers put forward by delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the European Union , and by New Zealand .  
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Operative paragraph 9 recommends that , pursuant to the adopted three-item phased approach , the Disarmament Commission , at its 1996 organizational session , adopt the following items for consideration at its 1997 substantive session : ( a ) the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; ( b ) the fourth special session of the General devoted to disarmament ; and ( c ) the new agenda item on conventional weapons , to be decided by the Disarmament Commission at this session .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development [ 7 ] / it is pointed out that although the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community ,  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
Welcomes with special satisfaction the adoption by the African leaders of the final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty ( the Pelindaba Treaty ) , 5 / which constitutes an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security and which , at the same time , recognizes the right of African countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples ;  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 19 / the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter and its annex to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly , under the agenda items entitled " General and complete disarmament : regional disarmament " , " Review and implementation of the concluding document of the twelfth special session of the General Assembly : regional confidence-building measures " and " Maintenance of international security " , and of the Security Council .  
In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
It was currently preparing an integrated plan of action to combat the so-called " paramilitary " groups that had sown death and terror in rural areas , and planned to reactivate a special armed group capable of tackling those groups successfully .  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
Also requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to continue its special role in the field of trade and environment , including analytical and empirical work , conceptual and empirical studies , policy analysis , and consensus-building , with a view to ensuring transparency and coherence in making environmental and trade policies mutually supportive , taking into account the need for continuing close cooperation and complementarity in the work of the Conference , the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Trade Organization ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Ukraine afforded women equal rights and opportunities in the areas of education and specialized training , labour , remuneration , promotion and socio-political and cultural activities and also implemented special measures to protect the labour and health of women , enable women to combine work with motherhood , and extend legal protection and material and moral support to mothers and children .  
The economic situation in Angola should also be the subject of special attention on the part of the international community , given its specific nature , characterized by a devastating war lasting more than 30 years that has destroyed the entire infrastructure of the country and has disrupted its economic system .  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
Prices of internationally traded goods ( measured in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) ) are expected to change only marginally over the short term , as productivity increases , trade is further liberalized and competitive forces ( including in commodity markets ) contribute to keep global inflationary pressures at bay .  
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
In view of the harsh economic situation , the United Nations Special Coordinator in the occupied territories stated that the standard of living of Palestinians living under the autonomous region of Gaza had declined by 50 per cent since the signing of the Interim Agreement . 8 / A special appeal was launched to the donor community to support the Palestinian authorities in this crucial period . 
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Until special procedures about an aerospace object are prepared , the aerospace object flying in the airspace , especially in a certain State 's territorial airspace , is considered as an aircraft and the aerospace object located in outer space is considered as a space object which is subject to space law .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
Assistant Budget Officer ( P-2 ) .  Reporting to the Budget Officer , the incumbent would be responsible for ( a ) coordinating , collecting and organizing proposed budgets of substantive offices ; ( b ) assisting in the preparation of budgets and performance reports of UNAVEM and the monitoring of allotments ; and ( c ) preparing standard and special financial budgetary reports and related correspondence , as required , for the Chief Administrative Officer .  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
If it was difficult to give proper treatment in an ordinary detention centre , or if a special or a long-term treatment was required , a patient would be sent to special detention institutions where sufficient medical treatment was available .  
The key elements of the plan included an agreed ratio of IPTF to Federation police in the various areas ; the issuance of special identity cards for Federation police authorized and cleared by IPTF ; a change in the composition of the Federation police in each suburb to reflect the ethnic mix of the population according to the 1991 census ; IPTF authorization of Federation police check-points ; and requests in advance for searches of houses or private property .  
During the special plenary session of the Congress devoted to technical cooperation , it was stated that technical cooperation was indispensable to building and supporting both democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems .  
In its resolution 4 / 1 of 9 June 1995 , entitled " Succession of States in respect of international treaties on combating various manifestations of crime " , the Commission emphasized the special importance of the consistent and effective implementation of international instruments on combating crime , and called upon successor States to confirm to appropriate depositories that they will continue to be bound by obligations under relevant international treaties on combating various manifestations of crime , to which their predecessor States were parties .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Those amendments also introduced a requirement for banks and special financial institutions to report to the competent authorities all transfers abroad of Turkish lira and foreign currency exceeding US $ 50,000 or its equivalent , except in the case of exports , imports and invisible transactions .  
Other elements identified as important , especially as regards sex crime , were : the adoption of adequate legislation ; the setting-up of special offices at police stations with separate facilities ; the provision of assistance and especially trained practitioners to handle female victimization ; conducting specialized , multifaceted training courses ; setting up specialized police units ; establishing national reference centres to collect and analyse data and effectively monitor , prevent and suppress the phenomenon ; education ; coordination ; and information dissemination .  
As one form of outreach , set up special advisory centres for women and the girl child who might be in trouble or in difficult or irregular situations , including those involved in drug abuse or illicit trafficking , those engaged in prostitution and pornography , runaways , street children , the homeless and those experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma ;  
Where alternative programmes target special population groups , however , their success rate is high , equal to the peer-led programmes and with better results than conventional drug education programmes . 35 The successful programmes are those that have been individualized to meet the needs of each client and those that have included activities to enhance personal competence , such as reading skills and job skills , as well as physical adventure .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
Along those lines , it was suggested that the requirement should be limited to sensitive areas of public service or to cases where an abuse of power might be suspected and that the last sentence should be revised to read : " All information provided shall be treated as confidential but may be disclosed at a country 's discretion within the framework of special procedures . "  
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .

Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development it is pointed out that while the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , and particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community , 
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in order to ensure a strong and independent administration of justice ;  
In this area , special attention must be paid to the challenges inherent in improving the quality of services and strengthening social integration through the organized participation of civil society in the formulation of policies and programmes and in control over their management .  
Among them were the following : their removed location from sources of information and special components ; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements ; the lack of qualified suppliers , which resulted in more expensive in-house process development ; and a less efficient country infrastructure .  
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
Non-governmental organizations in general consultative status , special consultative status and on the Roster which express their wish to attend the international conferences convened by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , and the meetings of the preparatory bodies of said conferences , shall be accredited for participation .  
The Commission also continued to study the distributive aspects of economic development , with special emphasis on analysing the effects of adjustment processes on income distribution ; public policies aimed at changing production patterns and promoting sustainable development and social equity , with an emphasis on assessing their effectiveness in those different spheres .  
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
If two adjoining countries do not agree on a set of common rules on how goods passing through each other 's territory will be treated , then national law will prevail in each case , and a motor vehicle , for example , might be subject to multiple unnecessary inspections , might require different insurance coverage , might be subject to special license requirements , etc .  
It is truly regrettable that the Security Council , which bears special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , should see fit to delete these items without heed for their objective and historical value and without prior consultation with the States concerned .  
INFOTERRA , the Global Environmental Information Exchange Network , is operating through 171 government-designated national focal points ; a network of 8,000 sources of information , including national and international institutions , non-governmental organizations , industrial and commercial enterprises , academic institutions and experts ; 34 special sectoral sources , and 10 regional service centres .  
As part of the plan , which involved the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and several international non-governmental organizations , relief food and essential drugs were provided to vulnerable groups , seeds and tools were distributed to farming families , special feeding centres were set up and vaccination campaigns were conducted .  
As stated in the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( see A / 50 / 361 , paras . 44-49 , despite several cases of application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations , in connection with sanctions against Southern Rhodesia , Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , there is no uniform and internationally recognized methodology for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of non-target States affected by the implementation of mandatory economic sanctions .  
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
Although no substantive intergovernmental or inter-agency discussion on the subject has yet taken place , the recent conceptual analyses and specific case studies have featured several basic principles or criteria for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of States arising from the implementation by them of sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
Accordingly , the Secretary-General addressed letters , in July and September of 1993 and January of 1994 , to the executive heads of the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial organizations ( the World Bank and IMF ) and the regional development banks , requesting them to provide him with updated information on activities undertaken by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States .  
As reported in the annual overview report for 1993 , the information received regarding additional measures or special assistance in response to the immediate hardships encountered and urgent needs faced by the affected countries was largely of a preliminary nature , which reflected the need to assess the extent of the impact of sanctions on the economies of the affected countries in order to assist them in developing appropriate policy responses and in preparing financial requirements for remedial measures . 
Invites the financial and trade institutions participating in the high-level segment of the Council in 1997 to furnish relevant special reports and studies on the selected theme , within their respective mandates and areas of expertise , and on important developments in the world economy and in international economic cooperation ;  
Coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy , the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime more than four years ago now continue to exert their negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in the country .  
There were also those who considered that , in view of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the profound and far-reaching changes that have transformed the international security landscape since the end of the cold war era , and the advent of a new century , profitable use could be made of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to review and assess progress towards the " grand vision " and programme of action of the Final Document .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
Also in that resolution , the General Assembly renewed its invitation to the international financial institutions to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on those States .  
The Assembly renewed its request to the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to take into consideration , in programming their development activities , the special needs of the affected States and to consider providing assistance to them from their special programme resources , and renewed its appeal to all States , on an urgent basis , to provide technical , financial and material assistance to the affected States to mitigate the adverse impact of the sanctions on their economies .  
The Committee , taking into account difficulties encountered in ensuring adequate preparation of meetings , including timely distribution of documentation , as well as the ability of Member States to participate fully , recommends that the General Assembly should instruct the Main Committees to review the number of special conferences of the United Nations already proposed and scheduled in their respective fields of activity prior to deciding upon the scheduling of new and additional special conferences , thus bearing in mind the relevant portions of General Assembly resolution 33 / 55 . "  
Reaffirming that investment in people is as vital as investment in capital , they called for paying special attention to sound basic education , skill formation and training , which is a lifelong undertaking , and improving the transition from school to work ;  
The International Council on Social Welfare , made up of a wide range of local , national and international organizations with special interests on issues related to social welfare and social development , adopted Summit follow-up as its top priority and held regional follow-up seminars for non-governmental organizations in Africa , Asia Pacific , Latin America and Europe .  
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1566 ( L ) , the Council considered that the ultimate goal of the work of the Commission should be the achievement of an integrated system in the collection , data processing and dissemination of international statistics by the organs and agencies of the United Nations system with special regard to the requirements of reviewing and appraising economic and social progress , taking into account the needs of the developing countries . 
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The Assembly requested relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions to strengthen their efforts to assist interested developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national water policies and strategies , and called upon the international community to give special attention to the revitalization of economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries , through , inter alia , a more diversified food and agriculture sector .

The intermediate amount of anticipatory pension consists of a basic amount , a pension supplement and a disablement allowance which is to cover the special expenses connected with the physical or mental disabilities , just as the amount is considered to partly compensate for the lack of working capacity . 
While all those procedural aspects are covered in a special chapter ( comprising a number of articles ) in other principal human rights treaties , in the case of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which does not have a treaty-based standing , more than a dozen Council resolutions and decisions were needed to complement the text of the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . Owing to this special " legal " situation , a decision by the Council could terminate the Committee 's existence .  
While the Bureau agreed that the rules of procedure needed to be fully respected and that specific decisions on the participation of major groups in the session would be taken by the General Assembly , it also agreed that a number of activities could be organized during the special session with a view to ensuring effective input of major groups and their active inter-action with government representatives .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 113 invited all relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including multilateral financial institutions and WTO , to contribute to the special session , and requested the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session .  
The Committee agreed that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant bodies , should actively contribute to making the special session a highly visible international event that would energize global commitment to the implementation of Agenda 21 and advance international dialogue and action for sustainable development .  
During the fifth session of the Commission , one possibility would be to organize , in parallel with the drafting groups that will work on the text of the final document of the special session , hearings involving representatives of Governments , major groups and eminent persons , devoted to an assessment of the existing and potential role , and contribution to its implementation , of each of the major groups identified in Agenda 21 .

That concern arose from their commitment to decolonization and the rights of the indigenous Kanaks , including the preservation and promotion of their social and cultural values , which had been reflected in the South Pacific Forum vision statement and the " Melanesia beyond 2000 " strategy which declared that the four Member States and the Front de lib �� ation nationale Kanake socialiste ( FLNKS ) were determined to support the orderly decolonization of New Caledonia with special safeguards for the indigenous Kanaks .  
These committees , which operate as special committees of the works councils , are tripartite in structure : in addition to the representatives of management and staff , their members include health and safety officials , i.e . the in-house doctor , the regional health and safety information officer , the head of security and , where applicable , the establishment 's social assistant ; not to mention experts on prevention of industrial accidents and occupational diseases , whom the committee can consult at any time .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .

The Commissioner-General held an extraordinary meeting of major donors and host Governments in Amman on 23 September 1996 .  
The Secretary-General attached special importance to the role of the Council in promoting a coordinated and integrated follow-up to major international conferences , and was confident that the outcome of the Council 's work in 1996 would further enhance its responsibility to draw together in a coherent framework the results of all major United Nations conferences to ensure that they guide the activities of the United Nations system .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
In addition , a special State programme had been drawn up to address the cultural , spiritual , educational and socio-economic problems of the 12-million ethnic Ukrainians living abroad .

Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 , and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Also decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
At its fifty-second session , the Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 71 , of 23 April 1996 expressed its outrage that the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape had been used as a weapon of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized that rape in the context of armed conflict constituted a war crime and called for the protection and care of rape victims , respect for the special needs of victims of sexual violence in the investigation and prosecution of alleged violations and punishment of those responsible . 
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,

As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .

Although the special circumstances of developing countries are recognized in many specific instances throughout the revised version , there is no separate chapter or annex devoted to those circumstances ( as in the previous version ) .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
It was essential to monitor the efficacy of the international human rights norms that were the basis of the work of the treaty bodies and the efficacy of the special procedures and thematic machinery which played an irreplaceable role in the effective promotion and protection of human rights .  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;

The Chinese Government , while committing itself to the promotion of economic development , had strengthened the country 's democracy and legal system , with special attention to economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights .  
This form of action has been of special importance in view of the precarious social and economic situation , which has been compounded by the impact on the country of mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the unilateral economic blockade from the south . 
As respect for fundamental rights and freedoms was an essential precondition for peace and security in the world , and for the prevention of international disputes and conflicts , Governments must , in order to strengthen international human rights monitoring machinery , report in a timely fashion on the manner in which they fulfilled their treaty obligations and must be required to cooperate with the United Nations special rapporteurs , working groups and experts .  
The principles elaborated in the above-mentioned administrative instruction on non-reimbursable loans for technical cooperation projects ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) , particularly in terms of an agreement or understanding between the United Nations and the donor and the issuance of a special service agreement with the individual , have been applied only in a limited number of cases .  
Gratis personnel have also been accepted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services ; their functions have included auditing and ensuring compliance with recommendations of the Office ; their contractual relationship to the United Nations is established by a special service agreement ; since support costs have not been charged to the donor Governments , those costs have fallen upon the regular budget .

NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,

I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
Thus , the special measures announced by ST / SGB / 282 and set out in ST / AI / 412 were developed with the objective of achieving for women equality of opportunity to participate , in the light of the established fact that , since the earliest days of the Secretariat , men colleagues have always far outnumbered their women colleagues at the Professional and , particularly , at the decision - and policy-making levels .  
Additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which included but were not limited to electrical , mechanical and special systems requirements , namely , uninterrupted power supply , building automated control and anti-intrusion security ;

The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .

In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .

That exclusion was largely acceptable because insolvencies of financial services institutions usually required prompt and discrete action ( for instance to avoid massive withdrawals of deposits ) and were , for that reason , administered under special regulatory regimes in various States .  
At its 10th plenary meeting , on 4 April 1997 , however , the Council decided , in order to allow the secretariat sufficient time to complete the tasks assigned to it by the Council at its nineteenth session , that the dates of the special session should not be fixed as yet but that it should be held over a three-day period between late 1997 and the end of January 1998 .

When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
In preparing for the special session the Governments of Member States should demonstrate their political will in practical terms by intensifying their efforts to eliminate poverty in general , eradicate absolute poverty , increase employment and decrease unemployment and by deepening social integration in their respective countries .  
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
At the same time , States are moving towards establishing the individual penal responsibility of those who commit extremely grave international crimes , through the creation of special courts and the forthcoming establishment of an international criminal court .

The latest initiative to Judaize East Jerusalem with the building of a new Jewish settlement on Arab land in Jebel Abu Ghneim , in a highly symbolic place , is a deliberate provocation in the light of the relevant resolutions adopted by overwhelming majority of the international community at the two urgent meetings of the General Assembly and at its emergency special session .  
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
Armenia hopes that this special session will take decisions to further integrate environmental and social concerns into the day-to-day regulatory tools of the international economy , and thus ensure that quality of life issues are addressed in a way more likely to lead to their successful resolution .  
Regarding energy as a substantive topic , it was considered vital to take into account a number of pertinent issues , such as the uneven distribution of fuel and energy resources , the interactive management of energy , energy savings , the problems related to biomass sources from contaminated forests and the need for a total energy system , and the special needs of small island countries .

In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 8 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly .

The basic principles of the negotiations are recognized as dialogue , mutual and continuing respect between the parties , voluntary resettlement of individuals , non _ discrimination , observance of the letter and spirit of the peace agreements , protection of the environment , maximum social benefit , preferential and special treatment of vulnerable groups , and community participation .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .

Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
Specific , reliable actions within the context of well-established programmes with clearly defined goals deserve special attention .

In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .

In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .

Following the precedent of the seventeenth special session , the preparatory body may wish to recommend that the vice-presidents of the upcoming special session should be the same as those of the fifty-second regular session of the General Assembly , on the understanding that the regional groups may make substitutions of the vice-presidents allocated to each group .  
The Assembly , in the same section of that resolution , stressed that the special session should " be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation . . . , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 [ 1 ] and other relevant conventions and international instruments " .

Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Such efforts should be pursued in close cooperation with community and religious leaders and non-governmental organizations , at all levels of the State , i.e . national , regional , zonal and woreda levels , and special emphasis should be placed on the need to coordinate the policies designed to implement the Convention between central and local authorities .  
The Committee recommends that special protection measures be adopted and implemented in relation to children living and / or working in the street , children in conflict with the law , in particular those deprived of liberty , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , abused and exploited children and children involved with child labour .

In preparation for its special session to review and appraise the implementation of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly , in paragraph 13 ( b ) of its resolution 50 / 113 of 20 December 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to prepare country profiles providing a concise presentation of progress made and constraints encountered in implementing Agenda 21 at the national level , compiled on the basis of national information received and in close cooperation with the Governments concerned . 
The deliveries to Armenia of military equipment and spare parts for them , which were unauthorized by the Government of the Russian Federation , have provoked a negative response on the part of a number of Russian officials and have become the subject of special deliberations in the State Duma of the Russian Federation , which has instructed its main committees - on defence , security , and CIS and ties with fellow citizens - to conduct a thorough investigation .  
Altogether , the new directions report contains 20 major recommendations that touch on other issues such as the formulation of national TCDC policies , the strengthening of national TCDC focal points , the reorientation of capacity and needs matching exercises , the promotion of " triangular cooperation " , the establishment of improved linkages with the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and the identification of new funding arrangements for TCDC , including the formulation of subject-specific TCDC " products " that could attract special funding on the basis of their intrinsic importance .  
This has arisen from our understanding of the mandate of the Rapporteurs as derived from the enabling resolutions , the standard terms of reference for fact-finding missions of special rapporteurs / representatives of the Commission on Human Rights , existing practice and the emerging human rights jurisprudence governing similar missions .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
Noting that the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has highlighted the imbalance in the special rapporteur system by referring to the fact that although there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the recognized interdependence , indivisibility and interrelationship of the two sets of rights ,  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Despite strenuous diplomatic efforts , in particular by the Secretary-General and his special representative , Mr . Nobert Holl , to broker a ceasefire and engage the warring parties in a peace process , the fighting has been raging unabated , with even greater intensity in recent months . 
Accusations contained in this paragraph , concerning alleged discriminatory laws , are inaccurate , never having been articulated in this manner by any international body dealing with the Yugoslav legal system - either CERD or the many special rapporteurs of the Commission .  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
The most desirable alternative would be to maintain the previously existing advantageous parking arrangements for diplomats performing their official duties , and to give them the appropriate legal and organizational status , for example by making the necessary additions to local legislative or other texts and issuing for diplomats ' vehicles special parking permits along the lines of those issued to State and City officials in New York .

Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
The Advisory Committee also devoted considerable attention to extrabudgetary funds in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,9 where it addressed the presentation of information on trust funds in the budget document , the primacy of United Nations regulations and rules with regard to any conditions attached to special purpose contributions and the need for a standard format and procedures for reporting on trust funds to donors with a view to reducing the administrative burden and excessive overheads .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :

The Dominican Republic attaches special importance to the ongoing reform process , given that it is capable , while respecting the principles and purposes that gave birth to the Organization , of ensuring a more democratic , transparent , representative and efficient system capable of facing the current challenges , especially those of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the peoples of the world .  
In this respect , the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international drug control , which is to be held in June 1998 , will provide us with an excellent opportunity to renew our political commitment by closing our ranks against illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for progress in preventive efforts .  
Although we were not entirely satisfied with the results of the recent nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held last summer , it is important that that session outlined ways of expediting progress in key areas of sustainable development , as defined in Agenda 21 .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .

Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .  
We are confident that the Secretary-General will ensure the continuing institutional capacity of the Organization to respond adequately to the needs of States , newly established institutions and other competent international organizations by providing advice and assistance , taking into account the special needs of developing countries .  
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
Having regard to the major disarmament and non-proliferation conferences already scheduled for the remaining years of the decade and to the need to concentrate scarce resources on specific and focused disarmament events and on goals attainable in the short term , consensus on the timing of another special session on disarmament and broad agreement on its objectives are vital to the prospects of success .  
There is an imperative need to continue to build on the agreements already reached and for concerted efforts focused on unresolved issues which should be addressed at the forthcoming fourth special session on disarmament , as they represent a continuing threat to international peace and security .  
In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
In the view of Argentina , before deciding to convene the special session , and after having carefully studied its financial implications , it would be advisable to ensure the proper preparation of the session and provide it with some real content so that we do not repeat past mistakes .  
It is therefore a timely and an opportune moment to hold this emergency special session of the General Assembly , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 377 ( V ) , entitled Uniting for peace , to deliberate on this crucial issue and all its essential aspects .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
At the recent XII Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , held at New Delhi , which concluded just a little over two weeks ago , the Non-Aligned Movement member countries had the privilege of hearing President Arafat in a special session of the ministerial conference , give a detailed presentation on the state of the peace process in the Middle East and the implications of the construction of the settlement by Israel at Jabal Abu Ghneim to the south of East Jerusalem . 
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
In July this year , earlier in this the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , my delegation emphasized , among other things , that it is not possible to divorce the complete nationhood of the Palestinian people from a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East .

While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Numerous administrative circulars in the public and semi _ public services and authorities lay down discriminatory treatment for the immigrant population , among them ANPE ( the National Employment Agency ) , ASSEDIC ( Family Allowance funds ) and the Social Security Offices , which are required to carry out special checks and to demand supporting documents and even systematically to inform on immigrants to a specialized department in the prefectures .  
Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close . 
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .

Requests the International Civil Service Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the United Nations common system , including consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
Some States observed that on a technical level , aerospace objects should not be considered as aircraft because they were designed to be spacecraft with special procedures for design , construction and launch different from those applying to aircraft , not to mention that their flexibility and capability to manoeuvre as aircraft was only incidental to their intended use .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
L . As in the case of question 4 , although there seem to be differences of opinion as to whether or not the distinct phases require different degrees of regulation , it was apparent from the substantive comments received that if a special regime for aerospace objects were to be discussed and formulated , all aspects mentioned by the respondents could be incorporated into appropriate language for such a special regime .  
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
In addition to the Special Rapporteur 's participation in the special rapporteurs ' meeting and in joint urgent actions transmitted to Governments , in 1996 the Special Rapporteur requested to undertake a joint mission to Nigeria with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
At its fifty _ second session the Commission on Human Rights decided , without a vote , that all continuing thematic or country _ oriented mandates established by the Commission and entrusted to special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups are expected to report to the fifty _ third session ( decision 1996 / 113 ) .  
One issue that warrants special attention relates to the new firms which have been operating in several countries and whose formal lawfulness , in the light of the relevant national and international legislation , is not open to question , as they are covered by the gaps and loopholes that would prevent their activities from being classified as mercenary stricto sensu . 
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .  
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .

Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Invites Governments to accord standard minimum humanitarian treatment to trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards and , with the support of the United Nations , to formulate manuals for the training of personnel who receive and / or hold in temporary custody victims of gender _ based violence , including trafficking , with a view to sensitizing them to the special needs of victims ;  
On the initiative of the Government of Togo , the Central Organ of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution , meeting at the ministerial level during the sixty-fifth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of OAU , held in Tripoli from 24 to 28 February 1997 , decided to hold in Lom a special session of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Central Organ in order to consider the situation in the Great Lakes region , with particular reference to eastern Zaire .  
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .  
The solution to the problem of terrorism lay in addressing its root causes , as reaffirmed in any number of General Assembly resolutions , such as 40 / 61 and 46 / 51 , which urged States to pay special attention to situations involving flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and those involving alien domination and foreign occupation , that might give rise to international terrorism .  
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women and specifically address the special needs of girls and women as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents , rural and urban poor , persons in remote or neglected areas , and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
Further reaffirms that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Reaffirms that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty , to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
When ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to the present Convention , or at any time thereafter , a Party which is not a regional economic integration organization may declare in a written instrument submitted to the Depositary that , in respect of any dispute not resolved in accordance with paragraph 2 , it recognizes as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement in relation to any Party accepting the same obligation :  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
The President : Members will recall that , during the consultations I held pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 181 , Member States expressed an understanding that I would select non-governmental-organization representatives of major groups , as identified in Agenda 21 , to participate in the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly according to certain criteria . 
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
The High Contacting Parties shall ensure favourable conditions for direct trade and other economic relations and cooperation at the level of administrative and territorial units in accordance with national legislation currently in force , devoting special attention to the development of economic ties between border regions .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The official results of the elections were announced on 30 April 1997 and confirmed by the Electoral Appeals Commission , which reported that most complaints received were addressed by the special measures adopted by the Transitional Administrator on election day , or dismissed after due consideration . 
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
Nationally and regionally coordinated strategies should be developed for the implementation of the mandates and recommendations contained in the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session , 1 / on 23 February 1990 , the Tehran Declaration adopted by the Ministerial-level Conference at the twenty-ninth session of the Subcommission , held at Tehran in 1992 , and other relevant international drug control instruments ;  
However , in complex or overtly political situations , such as Cambodia , southern Sudan , northern Iraq and the former Yugoslavia , special arrangements were put in place on a case _ by _ case basis , including the designation of a lead agency to coordinate the international humanitarian response .  
As of 30 June , the office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson had opened 1,692 provisional files , registered 713 cases , issued 10 final reports in individual cases and eight special reports ; 38 requests for interim measures have been successful , and 21 have not been implemented by the authorities . 
Another major component of that institutional framework was the Ministry of Women and Children 's Affairs , whose role included national policy formulation , implementation of special programmes , women 's legal and social rights , registration of voluntary organizations and dealing with international organizations .  
The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961 had amended Muslim personal law by modifying inheritance provisions , prohibiting additional marriages after the first marriage without permission from an Arbitration Council constituted according to the Ordinance , imposing procedural restrictions before divorce became effective , prescribing a special procedure for determining the amount of maintenance payable by a husband to his wife and modifying provisions concerning dowers .  
The reaffirmation contained in the Final Document of the Fourth Review Conference is of special importance to Cuba , in that the use by States parties , in any way and under any circumstances , of microbial or other biological agents or toxins that is not consistent with prophylactic , protective or other peaceful purposes , is effectively a violation of article I of the Convention .  
The Ministers reviewed the activities of CPLP , with special focus on the plan of action of the Executive Secretariat , as approved by the Ministerial Meeting held in New York on 26 September 1996 , and they reaffirmed their confidence in CPLP as a privileged instrument for consolidating , developing and enhancing their common historical ties , on the basis of the shared principles of peace , democracy , social justice and economic progress . 
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
Urges Governments and non _ governmental , national and international organizations to collect and disseminate gender _ disaggregated statistics and indicators to monitor the representation and participation of women at all levels of political , economic and social life , with special attention to the impact of the multiple barriers faced by many women who exist at the intersection of discrimination , based on race , gender and poverty ;  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and in particular to its Chairperson _ Rapporteur , Ms . Erica _ Irene Daes , for the important and constructive work accomplished during its fifteenth session ; 2 .  Requests the Secretary _ General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its fifteenth session to indigenous organizations , Governments and intergovernmental and non _ governmental organizations concerned , as well as to all thematic rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups ;  
The Committee had proposed that at its 1997 session the advisory committee should finalize the agenda and work out the organizational aspects of the special session and a schedule of events , as well as outlining the desirable form of participation of relevant international , regional and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in the preparatory work .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
The purpose of the special session should not be to renegotiate Agenda 21 or to redefine the principles and objectives of sustainable development , but rather to identify priority sectoral issues that required follow-up at the international level .  The outcomes of other United Nations conferences held since the Rio Conference should also be taken into account in order to avoid duplication of ongoing work or work which had already been implemented in other international forums .  
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
The Group of 77 and China also fully supported the World Food Summit , at which the most serious problems were to be considered and addressed and the special session of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the commitments assumed under Agenda 21 , which would provide the international community with an excellent opportunity to study the principal obstacles to the effective implementation of the Rio agreements . 
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
The competence of the Tribunal may also be extended , with the approval of the General Assembly , to any other international organization or entity established by a treaty and participating in the common system of conditions of service , upon the terms set out in a special agreement between the organization or entity concerned and the Secretary-General of the United Nations .  
The Agency had agreed in March 1996 to permit the survey of UNRWA vehicles as a pragmatic , temporary and exceptional measure only .  Moreover , despite the establishment of a special VIP / international organizations lane at the Erez checkpoint and UNRWA 's agreement to a magnetic card system which was proposed to expedite crossings , the search procedures continued to result in time-consuming delays for UNRWA staff and , on occasion , damage to UNRWA vehicles .  
Other findings included continued recruitment from a narrow geographical base with apparently no attempt to diversify recruitment sources as prescribed by existing policies , finalization of special service agreements during or even after the consultancy in many cases and high consultancy fees .  
This was recognized by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session when it stated , with reference to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development , that transparent and participatory processes should be promoted when integrating economic , social and environmental objectives and that this will require the involvement of national legislative assemblies ( resolution S-19 / 2 , annex , para . 24 ( b ) ) .  
Research in policy development will enable Member States to respond to the global problem of ATS by means of improving the international drug-control system through the action plan against manufacture , trafficking and abuse of ATS for the special session of the General Assembly , and its operationalization and continuing scientific work to keep abreast of the perpetually changing ATS issue .  
Activities include : preparing working documents and a draft report of the Board on the implementation of article 12 of the 1988 Convention ; providing Governments with relevant information to determine the legitimacy of shipments of precursor chemicals and to advise them regarding decisions on specific suspicious shipments ; preparing critical review documents and other relevant materials for the Board and its advisory expert group and for establishing a limited international special surveillance list ; and providing substantive advice on activities related to precursor control .  
The International Monitoring Committee and MISAB were invited to participate in a special commission , beginning on 5 October , in seeking a viable and satisfactory solution to the transfer of the school for the children being raised by the Army to an appropriate site with a view to settling the delicate question of this group of young people in the Central African Republic , which is a breeding ground for future members of the Armed Forces . It should be mentioned that some of the children attending the school had joined the ranks of the rebels . 
In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
It guided the substantive preparations for the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem , held in New York from 8 to 10 June 1998 , which represented a major landmark in international efforts to achieve a drug-free world .  
Further attention was drawn to the need to establish arrangements for special investigative techniques , such as electronic surveillance , undercover operations and controlled deliveries , as practical tools to penetrate criminal organizations .  
The meeting had been devoted to three themes : the creation of a favourable environment for the emancipation of teenage girls ; the special need for social protection of adolescent girls ; and teenage health , including sexual and reproductive health .  
In the efforts to find a fair and effective solution to the external debt crisis , a differential approach , based on the special problems of each individual State , should be applied .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
The girl child was added as the twelfth critical area during the preparatory process , as a result of regional preparations and of pressure to recognize that true progress could be realized only if the next generation was also the subject of special attention .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
In its preliminary conclusions and recommendations , the paper stated that human rights education , with special emphasis on racial discrimination , should not be confined to public and private schools and universities .  
Holders of special procedures mandates have refined their methods of work ; increased the frequency of their country visits ; initiated , in some cases , comprehensive comparative analytical studies ; and developed procedures for handling individual complaints .  
They included , for example , poverty , gender discrimination and the difficulties faced by children in need of special protection , whether institutionalized , living in the streets , involved in armed conflicts or substance abuse , exploited and abused , etc .  
To eliminate the need to import expensive ready-made prosthetic components from abroad , ICRC has introduced new materials and developed special moulds to facilitate low-cost production at the local or regional level .  
In response to specific concerns raised in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 , the IMO secretariat and its governing bodies have undertaken a number of new or expanded initiatives with respect to prevention of air pollution from ships ; new special sea areas and particularly sensitive sea areas ; irradiated nuclear fuel on board ships ; traffic separation schemes and mandatory ship-reporting systems ; port State control ; and the preparation of measures against tributyltin-based anti-fouling paints for ships .  
The General Assembly , at its nineteenth special session in 1997 , urged Governments to consider the positive and negative impact of subsidies on the conservation and management of fisheries through national , regional and appropriate international organizations , and based on those analyses to consider appropriate action .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
They are constituted by a limited number of plant species which live under special conditions of shallow brackish water , needing regular inflow of freshwater ; they capture the sandy and loamy products resulting from the erosion of neighbouring land . 
The Assembly decided that the preliminary estimate of resources for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 should therefore include a provision for special political missions , in the amount of $ 86.2-million at revised 19981999 rates , which should be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 ; and that additional requirements shall continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of Assembly resolution 41 / 213 .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the childs achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Some of those institutions have special loan programmes under which they become the sole lender of record to a project , acting on its own behalf and on behalf of participating banks and assuming responsibility for processing disbursements by participants and for subsequent collection and distribution of loan payments received from the borrower , either pursuant to specific agreements or other rights that are available under their status of preferred creditor .  
Promotion of temporary independent work for the disabled , support for their entrepreneurial activity and home _ based work and provision of flexible working hours ( with special emphasis on disabled mothers caring for minors ) ;  
Mother and child protection is ensured through special occupational safety and health measures for women , the creation of conditions enabling women to combine work with motherhood and the provision of legal protection and economic and moral support for mothers and children , including paid leave and other benefits for pregnant women and mothers .  
All population groups are covered by a coherent State health _ care system , with special attention being paid to women , pregnant women and parturients , children under 14 and other particularly vulnerable population groups , such as the elderly and the disabled . 
In order to cater for pupils ' various needs and abilities , the education system comprises schools of different types , forms of ownership and spheres of activity : there are 1,890 general schools , including 270 schools with in-depth study of specific subjects , 65 gymnasiums , 39 lyces , 2 boarding schools for children requiring a special educational and living environment , and 19 specialized schools for children with mental and physical developmental deficiencies .  
States , in particular those which have already included international human rights standards in national legislation , should be urged to extend these basic rights to migrants explicitly , through appropriate legal enactment , due account being taken of the special needs and conditions of the various types of migrants ( recruitment , job and housing security , family reunion , education and social security ) .  
Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .  
During their joint visit to Colombia in October 1994 , the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on torture both drew attention to the need to strengthen the ordinary justice system to make it universally more efficient , so that it would no longer be necessary to resort to special justice systems , such as the system of regional justice ( see report E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 111 ) .  
Articles 212 and 213 of the Constitution stipulate that the armed forces are obedient , professional and non-political , and shall not deliberate in matters of service , and that their structure , legal regime , doctrine , composition and functioning are defined by the law , regulations and special provisions which the President of the Republic may adopt .  
Furthermore , the network of the Centre for Initiatives and Advancement for Women , as part of a project receiving financial support from the European Union , is promoting an improvement in the status of women by increasing their active participation in the countrys development and thus affording equal opportunities for women to contribute effectively to national economic , social , cultural and political processes , placing special emphasis on rural areas .  
The European Union has supranational competition rules ( relating to RBPs , to public undertakings and undertakings granted special or exclusive rights , and to subsidies ) , which are linked by the Treaty of Rome to the fundamental objective of establishing a common market .  
Additional requirements of $ 1,991,900 are recorded under civilian personnel costs , due to various developments such as the unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries , noted in paragraph 27 above ; as well as the delayed termination / separation of individual local contractors employed under special service agreements ( SSA ) , and of local staff hired as general temporary assistance whose contracts expired beyond 30 June 1997 .

In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .

In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .

In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .

In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
However , in order to bring about a rapid economic growth of the national economy , the developing countries have generally selected the developed areas to implement a special opening up policy to promote further economic development of the developed areas by means of preferential policies and have regarded these areas as growth centers for promoting the overall development of the national economy .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .

People will not forget that in the autumn of 1997 , the special administrative region government , which had just been set up , faced the impact of the financial crisis that wrecked havoc across Asia . The prices of securities in Hong Kong , whose pillar industries were the financial business and real estate , plummeted and the prices of houses also fell drastically , causing the economy as a whole to decline .  
While people were sighing in despair , the special administration region government took drastic measures on its own initiative to strengthen the linked exchange rate system , drove international speculators out of Hong Kong , and stabilized the securities market and financial market , thus proving the pessimistic predictions of some people to be untrue .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
Meanwhile , " red army " officers and men studied and discovered the countermeasure of sending out reconnaissance troops to attack the " blue army " night monitoring and control system .

Since the second Gulf War , the United States has established its dominant position in the region by promoting the policy of " restraining Iran and Iraq in the east and promoting peace talks in the west " .  It has basically achieved the two set objectives of protecting the security and stability of its special ally Israel in the Middle East region , and ensuring the safe and smooth supply of Middle East oil to the West .  
It is necessary to integrate education with management and punishment .  In view of the special feature that the financial sector has more economic crimes than any other sectors and through the establishment of three defensive lines of ideology , system , and law , the financial sector should coordinate its regular ideological education with strict management and its efforts to strictly crack crimes , so as to form an education-management-crackdown structure .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
" Go ! "  No sooner had the group leader issued an order in a low , deep voice than the " special combat " soldiers set out by crawling out of the green curtain of tall crops .  In the twinkling of an eye , they submerged in the lake .  
The lake was more than 1,000 meters wide between its southern and northern banks .  Though it was by no means difficult for someone carrying nothing to cross the lake , it was indeed far from easy for the " special combat " soldiers , who were each carrying equipment as heavy as or more than 20 kilograms , to do the same .  
In an area where there were high mountains , steep cliffs , long and deep valleys , thick bushes , and ferocious animals , a " special assault group " was faced with a ruthless battle : It had to accurately find a way out by crossing through a primeval forest as deep as 35 kilometers in the pitch-black night within 11 hours without being discovered by the " enemy " forces , who were armed with all types of modern reconnaissance equipment . 
The 11th special assault group encountered a patrol team of the " enemy " after seeing " a flash of light " in an area some 20 kilometers inside the " enemy " defensive zone .  With their night vision devices , the " special combat " soldiers discovered that they had been encircled in a valley less than 100 meters long .  At such a critical moment , the group leader led the group members to tenaciously fight against the " enemy " at close quarters .  
At dawn , this reporter found at the mouth of the mountain , which was known as " Xiyangkou " , that the " special assault group " members , who had engaged in fierce fighting overnight and had broken through a defensive zone guarded closely by the " enemy " forces , which was as long as 35 kilometers , had become exhausted and had bloody cuts on their faces and hands .

Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
On the battlefield of the Liaoning-Shenyang Camp of the old days , a certain motorized infantry brigade conducted a special live-ammunition practice : Operating tanks , firing antiaircraft guns , and launching missiles , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee operated some 10 authorized main-battle firearms , and not a single shot missed its target ;  
In this regard , Zhang Li proposed that facing the situation of China 's accession to the WTO soon , the educational sector at the government level should take the work of research , exposition , and verification as a matter of great urgency , use the experience of the 40 countries that have joined the education trade agreement for reference , set up a special organ to coordinate pertinent departments , and begin the procedure of making initial preparations .  
Facts have proved that economic operating pattern is the decisive factor of stimulating and attracting talented personnel , and the foundation for bringing up new-type personnel with the special characteristics of having enterprising spirits , competitive awareness , concepts of law and credibility , and professional ethics lies in the market economy .  The WTO is an invisible and powerful pointer as well as the soil for breeding and hastening parturition .  
At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
What warrants our special attention is that the " Proposal " for the first time oriented the " vigorous promotion of the national economy and universal application of information technologies in society " as a " strategic move to embrace the overall construction for modernization " , unequivocally proposing that the " information technology should contribute to industrialization , display its newly emerging superiority , and achieve leaping development in the social productive forces " .  
One special combat soldier filled a pop can with the " eight-treasure porridge " and handed it to me .  I was expecting a lousy taste , but to my surprise , it was a sweetish sour flavor and " tasted super " .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , Xiamen 's gross national product roseby 16.6 percent on an annual average and the city 's GNP and financial revenue also ranked the first among all special economic zones .  
After the reversion , the government of the special administrative region made the solution of social security the primary job under the strong support of the central government and increased the force to hit all crime activities , and had a distinct affect .  
There will be 4% growth in total local productivity ; at the same time , the government of the special administrative region is trying to improve the investment environment progressively and trying to make the economic rules better and more complete .  They are raising the administrative efficiency and opening the cellular phone and web connection markets to strengthen the desire to invest from inside Macao and outside of Macao .  
First of all , the special administrative region seriously exercises the right of administrative management , legislation , and power of final adjudication and right of independent justice that the basic law gives , so the residents of Macao fully enjoy all the freedom and rights of speech , journalism , religion , and forming groups that the basic law rules .

To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Our special combat platoon and a disguised detachment adopted a tactics of " making a feint to the east and attacking in the west " and " drawing the snake out of its hole " and the deceptive means of setting up fake missile vehicles .  They finally discovered the " devils " on No . 3 Height 20 km away .  After the discovery was reconfirmed with infrared imaging device , laser radar and other surveillance devices , they promptly made an assault .  
After launching a special campaign to crack down on criminal and vicious groups throughout the country , China has successfully destroyed some criminal and vicious groups , cracked down on a large number of major and serious criminal cases , and severely punished many criminals .

The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
Recently , a leading Taiwan official openly claimed that cross-strait transport links are " special international routes " and " the formulation that cross-strait links are domestic routes is absolutely unacceptable , " adding that this has involved the serious issue of so-called " national prestige . "

It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Under the leadership of local party committee and government and with the support of the broad masses of the people , public security organs at various places have carried forward the spirit of brave fight and persistent battle , hit hard , moved toward a good beginning of the special target struggle on " hitting the mob and eliminating devils , " and obtained preliminary results .  
For instance , there were no China-made robots 15 years ago , but China has currently developed a group of industrial robots , service-oriented robots , and special robots which are applied to industrial production , work involving high risks , and other businesses .  For example , robots for wall cleaning , pipeline robots , robot-like engineering machinery , contour spraying robots , assembly robots , micro-driving robots , and automatic pathfinders have been on the market for application .  Important achievements have been made with the technique of underwater autonomous deep diving .  
The United States government has , year after year , taken China , a nation with thriving business opportunities , improving daily , and constant improvements in the people 's economy , politics , society and culture , a country where all nationalities come together to construct their own special brand of socialism , and harshly portrayed her as a country where all kinds of rights are exploited , where social order is overturned , a nation which has no path forward .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
Taiwan has a definite advantage in such areas as capital , specialized talents , buying and selling of technologies , enterprise management , and international marketing .  Taiwan businessmen are also blessed with the special advantage of language and ethnicity and thus have many favorable conditions in fighting for a share in the mainland market and in seizing investment and trade opportunities .  
On the other hand , we will encourage and support medium and small enterprises , particularly the science - and technology-based enterprises , to advance in the direction of being " special , refined , unique , new , and intensive , " do a good job of coordination with the large enterprises , and heighten their specialized and socialized level in production .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France .

Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
This meeting fully affirmed the results of the special campaign at the previous stage against smuggling , foreign exchange evasion , illegal foreign exchange remittance , and deceptive acquisition of tax reimbursement for export , as well as the joint operation against the law-breaking and criminal activities of producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy commodities ; thoroughly analyzed the severity and harmfulness of existing market economic disorder and the major causes of these problems ; set the principal tasks of rectifying and regulating the market economic order in the next five years and the work focuses this year ;  
The Chinese side has also pointed out that when the surveillance aircraft that caused the trouble flew into the airspace over China 's special economic zone , it should respect the provisions concerning the rights of this coastal country .  This act , which is very unfriendly to China , has seriously threatened China 's national security and severely damaged the consensus reached in May last year between China and the United States on avoiding dangerous military actions at sea .  
Ignoring the international law , the US plane had intruded intothe special economic zone in China 's coastal area , and made a turn to bump anddestroy a Chinese military aircraft .  This is an ironclad fact and can not bedenied .  However , what has been hard for people to understand is that after theincident , the US side has refused to admit its fault .  
According to the relevant stipulations of the 1982 " UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , " exclusive economic zones are neither territorial waters nor international waters , and they themselves have formed a category of regions with a special legal regime .  
Liang Guoju , director of the provincial Public Security Department of Guangdong , called a special teleconference the other day to lay out tasks for public security organs throughout the province ; meanwhile , he urged all localities across the province to publicize in the coming few days each 's results in the comprehensive management of local social security , including the number of criminal rings of an underworld triad nature and the number of suspects that each locality had successfully smashed and arrested .  
At an earlier time , the authorities also issued a directive , urging the public to come forward and inform against lawbreakers .  Public security organs have already set up special hotlines and email boxes for tip-offs ; at the same time , they have also called on suspects to turn themselves in order to secure a lenient treatment from the police .  
In this special fight against the evil forces , local authorities , party and government departments , and law enforcement authorities at all levels must work with one mind and with firm resolve .  While we must take quick , thunderbolt-like actions to rebuff the brazenness of the evil forces , we must also take thorough and careful moves to smash the protective shelters that harbor these evil forces so as to completely destroy their structures and cut their poisonous vines in our society .  
In his speech on a special subject , Professor Chen Ting-kuo from Taiwan Tanchiang University said that Taiwan boasts relative advantages in production management , global marketing management , and the management of scientific and technological research and development , while mainland 's advantages lie in the vast territory , large population , and other aspects , so the two sides should pay attention to combining each other 's advantages for economic development .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .  Because Taiwan 's enterprises have a special background of relationship between the government and the commercial sector , most of them are leaning toward shortsightedness for immediate gain .  Taiwan 's industry is narrow and shallow and is fundamentally insufficient to support a wide-ranging and a long-term arms race .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
A Recount of the Foreign Relations Act of the United States ( third edition ) , the most authoritative international law document of the United States , even says the agreement of the accepting state alone is not enough .

The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .

The armed helicopters conceal themselves by using complicated weather conditions , and make a sudden attack by conducting low-altitude flights and hedgehopping .  The armed helicopters land behind the " enemy " lines , and transport special task forces to press straight on the important target when conducting sabotage operations behind the enemy lines .  This kind of sudden attack is commonly seen in modern warfare , and is called figuratively as the " surgical operation " on the combat field .  
Through repeated drills , the pilots have explored ways to cleverly avoid enemies by using such unfavorable weather conditions as before dawn , at dusk , and at dark night , and mastered various skills of rapid and precise landing on a multiple points , and coordination between helicopters and the special task forces on the ground to launch an assault against the enemy .

Here I would like to make a special explanation of one thing , that is , the " multipolarization , " which the Chinese people have often referred to , is based on a new understanding of the international relations in the new period or based on the philosophic and cultural theory that " the world is pluralistic and diversified in nature " rather than developing confrontation against a certain superpower or letting just a few big powers decide world affairs .

If we dogmatically cling to some individual theses and specific programs of action formulated for a special situation by authors of Marxist classics in the specific historical conditions despite the changes in historical conditions and present realities , then we will have difficulty in forging ahead smoothly and we may even make mistakes because our thinking is divorced from reality .

Thus when the fifteenth day of the seventh month rolls around , the common people in turn extend a hand to lost , roaming souls of the dead who are commonly called " the good fellows . " Those temples which perform special rituals will erect a twenty-or thirty-foot-high lantern pole , and stick on bamboo leaves , and inscriptions honoring the Three Magistrates are written on the lanterns . The higher the lantern tower and the more lost souls attracted , the greater the merit accrued .  
As for Hong kong , it is also a center of capitalism , has a special culture brought about by the mix of Orient and Occident , has highly developed communications and access to a wealth of information ; it is very free and people do n't interfere in each other 's lives ; it is very liberal , and no one cares about your political position ; already thirty percent of its broadcasting is Mandarin music , and it will take at least five years before its creative capabilities catch up to Taiwan .  
Market Expansion : Money is rolling in at these companies that match people up , the credit for which really belongs to those far-sighted entrepreneurs who broadened the " market . " Besides serving the young unmarried men and women of Taiwan , there are now introductions for friendship and marriage across the Taiwan Straits , as well as transnational special columns for Chinese abroad ; the age levels have been broadened to include the " second spring " of divorced or widowed persons , as well as " September romances " for the silver haired set .  
The schools of theology , law and medicine are extremely famous . A special feature is that all of them have theoretical research as their strong suit . For example , in the medical school , besides the general clinical training required at all medical schools , they also place extraordinary emphasis on research and every student must periodically present a report on his or her own special area of research .  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
Stalin , who massacred the intellectuals , paid special attention to genetics , psychology , applied mathematics and computers , which he saw as products of capitalism , and on the basis of pseudoscientific theories he ordered the schools to suspend any relevant teaching . " At that time a deadly atmosphere hung over academic circles , " says Karapetjants Artemi , a senior collaborator in Chinese languages .  
On the other hand , Lenin , who had finished off the age of tsarist feudalism , stressed the need to industrialize and modernize the nation . This meant paying special attention to the study of science and engineering . With the confrontation between East and West following World War Two , the communists put more energy into scientific research that was linked to the defense industries . Even a lot of persecuted researchers were made to continue their work in the laboratories established in prison .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
These plans were produced by first of all bringing together a group of top-notch scientists , who would perform deep investigations , hold discussions and perform analysis and research before collectively coming up with worldwide development trends . Then related industrial departments would be mobilized to describe their scientific development needs . Finally , in accordance with the special strengths of Chinese research personnel , the three aspects would be integrated , and a most beneficial development plan would be proposed .  
When the 27,000 residents of Shuili Rural Township heard that the Chichi line would be dismantled as soon as their fleet new highway was finished , they launched a mass petition drive and formed the Chichi Line Preservation Committee , pooling local tourist resources and holding special activities to attract outside visitors .  
An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds . Everyone is encouraged to put forward performing columns for the procession , and Peikang 's special tradition of yi-ko flower chariots is being preserved .  
Much as he loves traditional outdoor theater , he is planning appropriate ways to educate audiences intheater-going : by setting up a circus tent , for instance , and charging a fee for refreshments , so that audiences will treat the theater as something more special than they had in the past . At the same time that he is busy forming the new company , Yu continues to engage in field work , searching for veteran artists and arranging for joint performances and master classes .  
But heavy metals are inorganic materials , different from organic materials which can link up with carbon molecules . They are processed out of ores and originally have the special characteristic of close binding with the soil . They lack the mobility of organic matter and can stay in one place for hundreds or thousands of years . And the microbes in the soil which can dismember virtually anything are useless against them .  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .  
After the special education law was passed in 1984 , disabled children just like normal children had the right to an education , and the educational authorities established classes for the retarded at some elementary schools and junior high schools .  
Despite having been established for only a short time , in the last two " preparatory " years the bicycle R &amp; D center has already come up with sixteen applications for special patents to provide to manufacturers for mass production . Moreover , an even more important breakthrough has been creation of equipment for precise measuring of the mutual tolerance of the bicycle frame and the other parts ( in the past they could only make rough guesses ) , which saves the enterprises the trouble of muddling through for themselves .  
But , functionally speaking , the transport capabilities of the electric vehicle simply ca n't compete with the power produced by burning fuel . Thus the electrical version ca n't be widely applied . In fact , it can only be considered for use in special circumstances , as passenger transports for airports , as material transporters in enclosed compounds , or as golf carts , which do not involve long distances or high speeds .  
" Absorbing foreign myths is one of the special features of Chinese culture , " says Cheng Chih - ming , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Theology at Fu Jen University , who studies popular religion in Taiwan . For example there is the male deity Kuan Yin , who transformed into Princess Miaoshan , the beloved daughter of King Miaochuang , after coming to China , and from that transformed into Kuan Yin , the Goddess of Mercy .  
Wang Chen-yi , secretary-general of the Association of Taiwanese Ballads , who has been to the mainland many times , contends that as ko-tzai-hsihas been developing for less than 100 years , it has the special characteristic of being thoroughly plain and simple . For example , singing is done in a natural voice , with the transitions gentle . Movements are smoother , more suave , closer to the style of southerners .  
A woman 's touch in management : One old and respected photographer , who like Chen Li-hung herself graduated from the Toyo School of Photography in Japan , comments that Chen Li-hung 's secret lay in promoting her business by making skilful use of the prestige of studying in Japan , of media advertising and of special offers ; these were ideas that would not even have occurred to many of the less imaginative male photographers .  
What Lin calls " knowing the earth " involves becoming familiar with different geographical environments . High mountains , rivers and marine islands all have their different appearances and their own special types of plants and animals ; tropical , temperate and frigid zones have their own natural conditions that can not be confused .  
After being pulled from the oil , it is golden in color , crispy on the outside and tender inside . Its special flavor is matched with heavy flavorings like hot sauce , garlic , and vinegar . Or you can add some pickled vegetables .  
In addition , when the representative group arrived in Berlin and found that the film festival 's daily publication was quite weighty , with the help of the public relations firm they made broad and friendly connections . Also , taking advantage of the timing , before the first showing of the film they invited important critics to a special preview showing .  
The National Film Archive took the films to a developing company , which gave them an ultrasonic cleaning , repaired the sections that were ripped and falling apart and then used all sorts of special printing machines and chemical techniques to blow up the negatives one frame at a time . Now the films look pretty much like they did back when they were released . All told , in personnel and materials , it cost about NT $ 400,000 to have these films preserved for another 50 years . "  
Before planting 20 million trees : Countries which attach importance to planning prefer to coordinate according to available land resources . For example , when a new residential area was being developed in the Roehampton district of London , it went through detailed planning with the original trees all being kept and protected just as though it were a park . Places such as the special tree-shaded walkway in Berlin , and innumerable other examples , could also be cited .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
Among the 34 special government projects commissioned last year , a total of 274 domestic and foreign patents have been won . That is on average a patent coming out every 1.3 days .  
Lu Nianhua , owner of the Ruby Chinese Restaurant in Paris , left Mainland China and went to work in France at the age of twenty , and only three years later became a restaurant owner . But he says that he did n't have any special secret at all for getting rich quick - - it was all thanks to Wenzhou people 's " magic flute " for whistling up mutual prosperity : the " monthly club . "  
One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever . This special feature combining rich flavors with diverse selection is just the thing for the youthful desire for constant change and novelty .  
The special features of the colored pottery discovered at Yangshao is that it is very lustrous , while the exterior is beautifully sketched with red , black , and white in the shape of subjects found in nature .  
The main harvesting tools included stone sickles , stone knives , and stone shovels . Compared to the earlier Yangshao era , manufacture of stone implements by striking had given way to manufacture by grinding . Some of the more special items include jade axes with carefully and skilfully done animal face designs .  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
" It 's a very technical issue , " explains jade expert Na Chi-liang . The objects of art from every era have their own special characteristics . The gods and animal face patterns of Liangzhu art is similar to the Taotie , a legendary beast often seen in statues of the Shang and Chou dynasties . But upon a more precise comparison , the beast faces of Liangzhu works appear more rustic and simple ; they purvey a feeling of fierceness .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
This is quite different from the sandy beaches characteristic of other parts of the island . Another special feature of the eastern coast is the sharply rising coral reefs and rock platforms . There are many types of colorful channels and caves cut into the coral reefs by erosion .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine . He will still have to be brazen-faced , go up to the counter and explain : " Because of a sudden increase in the high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean , the heavy downfall of rain was prevented from coming down . "  
In the eyes of others , the women of the Hakka - - who are a distinct sub-ethnic group with a distinct dialect - - are renowned for their astounding labor power , diligent and quiet-suffering characters , and genteel and delicate skills . This special way of life and general stereotype that people apply to these women is something molded by centuries and millennia of warfare and chaos .  
Tachen Island is located off the coast of Zhejiang Province . It is a poor and obscure little place whose cuisine is largely limited to seafood . Thus , for example , their " ginger tea noodles " is made with dried fish , shrimp shells , and other seafood fried up with ginger and sesame oil added to the noodles . It 's a special dish that Tachen people give to postpartum mothers to help them regain their strength .  
Some people have criticized Tsui Hark 's Huang Fei-hong as " superficial " and lacking the real martial skills of a great master . The constant use of ropes , of special effects which go beyond the humanly and physically possible , and of speededup action , the all-pervading Chinese popular aesthetic , the dramatic camera angles , the melodramatic dialogues and plot development , create an overall effect which is " very exciting , " but the special qualities of the main character Huang Fei-hong become rather blurred .  
It was hard for Chinese actresses to get parts and those that we did get all depicted stereotyped Chinese women . Even these were in scarce supply . " The way she saw it , for Chinese and American actors alike , a good audition would n't mean you would get the part . You 'd have to rely on that aura you projected , that special something extra .  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
A song sung in the setting sunAfter the X-rated performance had finished , several singers , who were rushed to the locale by special delivery , came onstage and began to sing . The audience simply got bored . Being modern people well versed in the wonders of karaoke , they went onto the stage and entertained themselves , as well as their friends .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
It 's a place of dramatic cliffs and gigantic boulders , where white sand beaches meet grasslands . But more than this , its special geographic location puts it in the middle of the Kuroshio current , which runs from the equator and nurtures coral and tropical fish , making for a beautiful and colorful underwater world .  
Comic books are immediately accessible , because they are direct and have emotional impact . This is one of the special features of the graphic narrative . And they are no different from conventional books - - they can be divided into ones which merely stimulate the senses , and ones which contain deep thought .  
Although they were born attached together , these identical twins share no special sixth sense ; if one wants to find the other , he 'll have to try the pager a few times like everyone else . When the brothers are together , they get even more amicably curious glances . Some people even stop what they are doing for a careful look , as if these passers-by were comparing the young men today with the image engraved on their brains of the two attached infants .  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
Normally such a ritual would not be performed during Ghost Month ( the seventh lunar month ) , out of consideration for the " good brothers " ( " homeless " spirits ) who are only allowed out into the world for this one month every year . But Li Jen-chi consulted Alimu and obtained a special dispensation . she has never doubted Alimu 's power . 12 August , Saturday , weather cloudy with scattered showers .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers . Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
Even if his academic record was n't anything special , he worked to help support his family . He was quick at making chicken cages , and early every morning would wash and shell the dried fava beans that his mother bought at the wholesale market and sold from her front door outside the military dependents ' village . "  
The quality of the performances put on by all these professional and amateur groups and individuals ranges from the appalling to the excellent , and audiences can pick and choose just as at a flea market . Around 10% of the fringe performances are special enough to have a chance of returning in a few years ' time as part of the official program .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
At 6:30 the actors started causing a loud commotion to drum up attention . Two actors , playing familiar slapstick roles from television , spoke together in Taiwanese and explained the special symbolic gestures in the Peking opera Picking up a Jade Bracelet , such as sewing with needle and thread , feeding chickens , and straddling the threshold . By seven o'clock , the temple square was already packed with curious spectators , watching the opera and following the explanations rolling across the electronic sign on the stage .  
Sam Wen says that the current crop of pro players , when youths in the 1970s , ran all around the world for international competitions , bearing the burden of national pride and struggling for medals . Their growth process was somewhat distorted , leaving them with many habits such as enjoying special privileges , wanting advantages , and having a little too much self-admiration . The players must of course work harder at growing up .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
This type of technology does n't require the user to have any special input-output devices to block out the real environment . Instead it employs the so-called " blueboard technique " using cameras . It makes a composite of images shot of the user along with computer generated virtual world images so that people can see themselves acting within the setting on the screen . One use for this is already visible in the weather programs of Taiwan 's three main TV stations .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Anyone holding an outdoor activity in rainy northern Taiwan has to depend on fate to make any money . So the main reason for choosing Taoyuan for the inauguration was the venue 's special feature : The transparent " sky tent " that can keep out the elements while allowing natural sunlight in , thus insuring that the event would not be rained out or blown off course .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Wu was ahead of her at school , so she has witnessed his long-term development . Back in school , Wu was a well-behaved child with a special classical quality to him . Then Chung saw him dancing in a loin cloth for the Cloud Gate Dance Theater , establishing the experimental Contemporary Legend Theater , and acting in movies and on television . His creative ability and experience made her feel that he was the best choice for Ah-Q .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
She continued to explain that the six holes in the shoes that monks and nuns wear represent planting one 's feet on solid ground , and seeing through the vanity of human desires . Their clothing varies according to region . For convenience , some wear long frocks ; others wear robes that leave the right shoulder bare , demonstrating sincerity . There are also special rules for getting dressed : Keep your whole body erect and look straight ahead ; only your hands can move .  
Besides all this hardware , the pedagogical methods carefully maintain an overall appearance : The lecture is written by a panel of experts . There are special instructors to correct test papers and essays . Students sign in with magnetized cards , and automated telephone inquiry systems are available so that parents can immediately know whether their children are absent from class . Test reports are graded by computer , so students can know their progress as soon as they have finished their test .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
While the rates of adjustment varied , they could be as high as 100% - for example , the fee for " partial liver removal " was raised from NT $ 4000-plus to NT $ 8000-plus . As for complaints by surgeons that they are " low-wage labor , " Parng states that in the future the main focus of adjustments in universal health insurance pay schedules will be on respecting doctors ' special skills .  
People are often bedazzled by the earth-shaking " sacrifices " of romantic love , but Ko believes that classical love , which " succeeds " by day-to-day effort , morning and night , is even more special . This is the deep and subtle spirit of " joy without excess . " Perhaps this is why in the West there is the saying , " marriage is the tomb of love , " whereas the Chinese , in a society built on the Confucian moral code , feel that " marriage is the beginning of love . "  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
However , as in the example of author Lin Ching-hsuen , people are often wrongly categorized based on these test results , and more and more doubts are being cast on this type of testing . This has been particularly true in recent years with Taiwan 's active promotion of special gifted and talented programs . Because such a large proportion of gifted students are chosen based on IQ tests , the question of the practicality and fairness of such measures has stirred up a great deal of controversy .  
Protectors of the land When the million or so hikers who climb Taiwan 's mountains each year tramp out of the dark cypress forests onto the open ridges , what meets their eyes is always verdant pines . " In shady , damp places , pine trees can not compete with the tall cypresses , but where there is ample sunlight , it is the pines which thrive . The pine woods have their own special scenery which puts you in a more cheerful mood , " describes one mountaineer .  
As the sun sets in Kaohsiung County 's Yanchao Township , the Chinan Highway is bathed in the yellow twilight . Just out of school for the day , junior high school student A-Mo trudges along the straight line of the road , with an inexpressible desire in his heart : to return to a very special home-a freestanding red-brick building with a sloping roof , where the front yard is an expanse of green grass , and the back yard boasts a basketball court .  
Not enough to go around " Although halfway houses can not completely replace the juvenile detention facilities , they can provide the authorities with another option in handling youthful offenders , " says legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , who is very familiar with the juvenile justice system . Halfway houses are like a sickbed , and jails are like the intensive care unit : " Those who are n't as seriously ill can just rest in a sickbed , but the dangerous cases need special treatment . "  
Kuo , who has designed many of the trails in the Taipei vicinity , emphasizes that Taiwan is very special . It is at the juncture of tropical and sub-tropical climatic regions , with high temperatures and heavy rains year round . Moreover , given its mountainous terrain , all the forest forms of the northern hemisphere are here , layered one on top of the other .  
In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
" She 's a very special person , " says Li Huan-hsin , general manager of E . Excel 's Taiwan branch . He describes her as very intelligent , and very ambitious , even running all over to promote her ideas when she was pregnant ; but at the same time she is modest and affable , and her life is very simple .  
Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
Without a degree , they ca n't become teachers . And the special coaching program has been discontinued . Many weightlifting instructors at the primary level are serving in the guise of " substitute teachers . " These primary-level teams are the training ground for " fresh troops " for the national team in the future .  
The grandfather of the group feels that traditional puppet theater is rich in meaning , and it is a shame no one wants to learn it today . But , he also has praise for high-tech special effects that have light rays blasting out of the characters ' hands , calling them electrifying and progressive .  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
Education Reform Group Institute director Ting Chih-jen , who is currently writing a primary-school social studies textbook for a private-sector publishing company , says that textbooks have always been treated as " bibles " by schools , so the figures chosen for inclusion in them seem to acquire a special aura . Unless one can find people who are universally esteemed , one is apt to be lambasted for including one but omitting another , or one 's choices may be praised by some but opposed by others . Thus the whole thing becomes a thankless task .  
The brutal murder of an ordinary postgraduate student at a prestigious university , in a research institute building with access restricted by the use of a magnetic card reader , shocked the public and aroused the special concern of the police .  
Everyone makes their own special contributions . By combining our resources , our lives and activities have become much more varied , " Wang says . To publish the newsletter , professional botanists living in the community provide information about plants , those who studied art provide the graphics , and those who work for magazines write and edit the copy . The result is an impressive newsletter that is a major resource for keeping people informed and for building a sense of cohesion within the community .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
Last year she held a show in the Huashan special economic zone and , even though the exhibition hall was in a state of near-collapse and filled with the smoke of mosquito coils , she still managed to create a romantic , tranquil and elegant atmosphere which was , indeed , a crowning achievement .  
A special feature of aboriginal pottery is its imperfectly circular shape , which results from being produced by hand rather than formed on a potter 's wheel . A lump of pounded clay is made into the vessel 's base , then beaten into shape using an egg-shaped stone and wooden paddle .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
Competitors were judged according to very rigorous standards . The head had to be kept centered , shoulders low , elbows down , arms loose , fingers extended , the breath drawn from the abdomen rather than the chest , etc . To aid in judging the skills of the competitors , the rules put special emphasis on large , sweeping moves . In addition to leg lift , fist form , step form , palm form , fluidity , and coordination , the competitors were also judged on style and rhythm .  
Amidst the hasty passage of the amendments , a provision allowing private gambling , long supported by a certain group of legislators , was attached to and passed along with the regulations . This rider reads : " For the purposes of staging internationally recognized events , application may be made to the competent authority for approval of special issuance of public welfare lottery tickets . "  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
The function of the garden , where you can chat and exchange ideas , is kind of like the role a museum plays as it attempts to communicate its message to society . The paper museum has already weathered one serious storm in its short existence , and it has proved to be a hardy survivor , organizing a number of outstanding temporary exhibits . There truly is something special about the Su-Ho Memorial Paper Museum . Expect this beautiful gem to be a fixture on Changan East Road for a long time to come !  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
G-Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water-soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface . Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time . G-Fun is also co-operating with the CTI to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .  
Lu Hsiao-fen , a film star who has won numerous awards at the Golden Horse and Asia-Pacific film festivals and who has recently jumped into prime time as the female lead in Fortune , explains : " They have a special name for shows that are being broadcast episode by episode as each one is shot : ' ON programming . ' It is common for an episode finished today to be shown two days later . "  
Her ever-popular larou is made in accordance with a time-tested recipe . She adds the spices in their special proportions , and then seals the meat in a vat to marinate for six days so as to ensure a full flavor . After being removed from the vat the strips are slowly smoked over a mixture of sugarcane bark , charcoal , orange peel and rice husks , until they have acquired a lovely luster and exude a delicious aroma .  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power . Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
The gifted students were assigned to normal classes , and it was only for math that they came together for a special class . Yet their math teacher felt that they still needed to go deeper and cover more ground . The math covered at school simply was n't enough , so they all enrolled in supplementary " cram school " classes as well . Mrs . Liu realized that the joint entrance exam questions got easier every year and that thus the essay might be the section that would determine her daughter 's fate .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates . Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands ( Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu ) and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .  
The team for the rice genome project includes : Chen Ching-san , who has long experience in rice research and special expertise in the fields of genetic engineering , molecular biology and biochemical analysis ; Chou Teh-yuan and Hsing Yue-ie , also experienced in rice research and particularly strong in sequencing analysis ; Wu Hong-pan , an expert on rice genetics and computer analysis ; and institute director Shaw Jie-fu , who is distinguished for his work on plant gene functions .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
By the same token , monasteries do not sell recordings of the special music used to help hungry ghosts cross the threshold from hell during Ghost Month , the seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar . Playing such music at random could well result in hungry ghosts emerging from hell only to find that no food and alms await them-thus defeating the charitable object of the exercise and pointlessly bothering the ghosts .  
When you first enter the Taipei Sea World , inside the large tank , visible through the transparent glass , sea creatures of brilliant colors and strange movements meander through the blue water . Recent special exhibitions have featured the delicate , translucent Clione lima-cina ( known variously as the sea angel , sea butterfly , and " angel of the floating ice " ) from the North Pole , and the awesome giant northern sea octopus . The aquari-um 's undersea tunnel makes visitors feel even more that they have entered another world .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
Not long after coming to Taiwan , Ho prepared a study entitled " Developing Organization behind Enemy Lines and Establishing Intangible Bases , " and sent it to Chiang Ching-kuo . Ho was summoned to meet with Chiang , and as a consequence was allowed to enter the army academy , from which he graduated ( in Class 20 ) at the " ripe old age " of 39 . But he did not enjoy any further special successes in his military career .  
Fish noodles are a special type of noodle particular to China 's southeast coastal region . They are made from four parts cornstarch and six parts eel , drum , and other high-grade fish . The mass is then rolled , pressed , cut , and dried in the sun .  
We decided to devote our special feature this month to the investments of Taiwanese businesses in mainland China , with which Taiwan has enjoyed annual trade surpluses of well over US $ 20 billion in recent years . We focus especially on the question of why Taiwanese high-tech manufacturers are moving offshore , and how they manage to keep afloat in the fiercely competitive market of the greater Shanghai region .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
I found the most recent issue of Sinorama , with its reports on the special local character of places like Tungkang , Meinung , Chiaotou , and Linpien , very refreshing . The reports were very touching , and much more thoughtful than the usual tour book blurbs . This is the kind of reporting that is really lacking in our society today , and offers a sense of intimacy that Taiwanese readers abroad can really appreciate .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
Her husband Li Chung-sheng , who was very accomplished at a wide range of Taiwanese Opera roles , died on stage when the gunpowder he was using for special stage effects accidentally exploded in his face . Sai herself later got into political hot water . Branded as a " capitalist roader , " she was thrown into jail for several months .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
The New Year vacation recently over , the flourishing Taiwan publishing industry rolled up its sleeves in eager anticipation and prepared to put its best foot forward for the tenth annual Taipei International Book Exhibit ( TIBE ) scheduled for February 19-24 . Many book lovers were hoping to take advantage of the exhibit as the various publishing houses came together in one place and promoted special discount sales for books to be sold during the last four days of the six-day event .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes . " How can it not have abundant stories , emotions , conflicts , dreams and all the sweet , sour , bitter and hot that make up people 's lives ? "  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
As Li Chen-ching explains , the MOE has decided this year to begin a special program for developing short-term researchers in key technology areas . Thirty-five spots will be funded for doctoral candidates recommended by their universities to go abroad to do research in 12 key areas-including nanotechnology , biotechnology , computer science , and microelectronics-for one year . Students need only have their application accepted , and they will be exempted from the normal exams for government scholarships .  
Today , it 's nothing special to have the chance to go overseas to study , and a more diversified value system has overturned the previous tradition of invariably studying in the US . The opening up of travel for the purpose of tourism has also allowed many people from different social strata to have the ability to experience foreign cultures .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
In the past , except for special industry databases , sources such as online news sites and all kinds of personal web pages provided an endless wealth of freely accessible information for people browsing the web , leaving little room for the survival of commercial web sites . Even portal sites such as Yam , and Yahoo 's Taiwan subsidiary Kimo , which claimed to have millions of subscribers , were frustrated by their lack of an " excuse " to charge fees .  
In the visual media kingdom of the US , in the past few years revenue from productions that include animation and digital special effects has exceeded that from films shot frame by frame on celluloid in the traditional manner , and in Japan , computer games outstrip the automobile industry in sales value , showing remarkable popularity despite the stagnant economy .  
To achieve this , CGCG has specially developed a production management system that breaks down the tasks involved in producing each scene into different categories . Designers are responsible for designing the characters , animators are responsible for adding movements , and other processes such as adding color , lighting and special effects are also handled by specialists . All these tasks are conducted simultaneously to reduce the amount of time needed to complete the project .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
Intersexuals ( also known as hermaphrodites ) are people who were born with two sets of sexual organs . They have chromosomal abnormalities or hormonal imbalances and are not transsexuals . People who adopt a persona of the opposite sex for a special reason , such as Mulan ( who took her father 's place in the army ) or the transvestites who change their sex to make a living , can not be counted as true transsexuals .  
At the end of June , the Executive Yuan established a special team to outline financial reforms . Invoking existing banking laws , the Ministry of Finance announced a tiered management policy for the credit departments of farmers ' and fishermen 's associations . The goal was to follow up on the August 2001 partial intervention ( in which a special fund was used to take over and restructure 36 of the worst-run ones ) by tackling the widespread problem of unrepaid loans at these credit institutions , to protect farmers ' real interests .  
For unemployment problems of this magnitude , it is unlikely that extraordinary legislative measures will solve the problem overnight . At the end of December 2002 , the total budget was thoroughly examined . Why is n't a long-term employment bill being channeled into normal budgetary policy ? And why was a special budget suddenly rushed through ?  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
This year marked a special innovation for Pinghsi 's Sky Lantern Festival , as Western Valentine 's Day fell between the Lord of Heaven celebration on the ninth day of the first lunar month and the traditional Lantern Festival on the fifteenth . Pinghsi expanded its Sky Lantern Festival into a carnival embracing all three .  
In addition , to cope with competition from low-priced imported rice resulting from Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization , beginning in 2002 Wufeng began cooperating with an agricultural research station of the Council of Agriculture ( COA ) to promote the use of Tainong 71 " Yi-chuan fragrant rice . " This variety , developed by Dr . Kuo Yi-chuan , has round and robust grains , and when cooked gives off a special taro fragrance .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
" I graduated second to last of my whole elementary school , " Lu explains . " My sister was my homeroom teacher during my first year in junior high . She felt that I learned too slowly , so she had me sent to the special education class . It took me four years to graduate from middle school , and because I could n't pass the high school entrance exam , I went to vocational school .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
Pots made from blackish ash-colored clay are also few in number , but they too have some special characteristics . The jars and vases have small mouths and big bellies . The material is of very fine quality and the exterior surfaces have undergone smoothing and polishing . There are broken lines and circles on the exterior surfaces of the " shoulder " portion , and these decorative line patterns normally encircle the outside of the vessel .  
They improvised and created as they progressed , though they modestly refuse to claim any great brilliance about the whole thing : " It 's just the basic instinct for working with your hands that most people who grow up on the farm have . " But there is something special about the work of these hardy rural folk . In comparison with the trite , commonplace nature of bamboo facades that you can see all over the place , there is a touching rustic charm to the Grass Academy .  
" To be designated a historic site , a building must be a repository of excellent stories , " observes Yu Chao-ching . " Otherwise , its architectural workmanship must be remarkable . Its character , special qualities and worth must first be understood . " Yu points out that successful architectural preservation is a process of constant change-of preserving what is good in a site , and then adding new good things to it .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
Vincent Hsieh , the chief operations officer ( COO ) at PC Home Online , which crossed over into online marketing three years ago , says that SARS definitely boosted Internet sales of things like surgical masks , thermometers , disinfectant , and air purifiers . But he also suggests that the Internet succeeds mainly because of its special characteristics-speed and suitability for new and unusual products . Therefore he thinks that online selling is attractive enough in itself that it will not experience any sharp falloff now that the epidemic is over .  
This has been especially noteworthy since the former state-run telephone company became Chung Hwa Telecom and began operating as a private enterprise , driving competition in the broadband Internet access market . This market has become very competitive , with operators offering special deals and unlimited access , thereby greatly contributing to the increase in e-commerce activity .  
Unlike Hsinchu 's experimental primary and middle schools , which are under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Yuan 's National Science Council , STSIP 's public primary and middle schools are covered by the Tainan County Bureau of Education , and are ranked at the same level as all public primaries , enjoying no special privileges .  
The 2003 Asia-Pacific Arts Forum marked another step in cooperation between the Council for Cultural Affairs ( CCA ) and NTUA , following on the 2000 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Forum . The Arts Forum , specially coordinated with the CCA 's 2003 " Creative Culture Industry Year , " devoted special attention to culture not only as an end in itself but also as an economic activity . It aimed to encourage discussion about the common problems facing the development of indigenous cultures and cultural industries in the Asia-Pacific region .  
Once while driving through the Yangmingshan mountains north of Taipei he happened across a big field of calla lilies shrouded in thick morning fog , and was inspired to study up on flowers . His studies once prompted him to make a special trip in the middle of the night to Tienwei Rural Township in Changhua County to watch the flower farmers carefully tending to their daisies by the light of electric bulbs .  
Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
In the next two years competition heated up as more people joined the industry . To find some special tools to give him an edge , Kung headed to Hong Kong . On his trip , he came across a kind of carved gourd known as an " egg gourd " in a department store . This egg gourd , so named for its size and shape , was a magnificent work of skill and beauty , and enraptured him .  
The groups he leads typically have " free time " scheduled for half a day or a full day so as to allow his charges to deeply experience and probe nature . " The special quality of ecotourism lies in its leisureliness , " stresses Chen Chang-po . When the travel itinerary is too tight , it fosters anxiety among the tourists and tour operators . Only when the mood is relaxed can one discard the pressures and cares of work and everyday life and allow one 's heart and mind to converse with and reconnect to nature .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
" Hard " thinking , based on military aggression and economic hegemony , has long dominated the fate and historical development of mankind , several times leading the world to the brink of extinction . Therefore Lu placed special emphasis on the spirit of cooperation and sharing , on " soft thinking " that can lead to win-win situations , pluralism , and mutual coexistence and prosperity . She urged that the Pacific be managed as a " soft ocean " of sustainable development .  
" Back in the 1960s and 1970s , increasing food production was an important target of economic planning , " says former Council of Agriculture chairman Peng Tso-kwei . Developing mountain and marine food sources and developing marginal land were central to achieving this objective . The government even established a special Bureau of Mountain Agriculture and Animal Husbandry , as well as another agency to develop land reclaimed from the sea .  
" Holding the Chinese Food Week on the very day as Chinese President Jiang Zemin finished a successful visit to Latvia has a special meaning , which will give more local people and guests to Riga a chance to have delicious Chinese food and learn the Chinese culinary culture , " said Carl Mains , general manager of the hotel on the opening ceremony of the Food Week .  
He said that the central government has always attached importance to the role of overseas Chinese , who are patriotic and have deep feelings for the motherland They have played a special role in pushing forward the motherland 's economic development , supporting the disaster relief work and promoting the reunification of the motherland  
ji made specific explanations on the relations between the central authorities and the macao special administrative region , basic rights and obligations of macao residents , the political system , and economic , cultural and social affairs stipulated in the draft basic law of the macao special administrative region  
located to the east of tian'anmen square , the museum of chinese history is the first national museum in china with exhibition halls of 8,000 square meters besides the regular exhibition of chinese comprehensive history , special exhibitions on various subjects are often held at the museum  
In this connection , special reference may be made to the Cooperation Agreement concluded on 9 October 1990 , which provided for mutual cooperation in all fields : political , economic and social , scientific and cultural .  
Our Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , also deserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless efforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and just and sustained by an equitable economic order .  
At the initial stage , in particular , special attention needs to be focused on culturally sensitive instruction that will result in effective communication skills and maximum independence for people who are deaf or deaf / blind .  
He was aware that the United Nations and certain of its organs had specific needs , such as peacekeeping and humanitarian activities , and considered that special statutory provisions should be applied in those cases .  
At the initial stage , in particular , special attention needs to be focused on culturally sensitive instruction that will result in effective communication skills and maximum independence for people who are deaf or deaf / blind .  
The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
Fuller consideration must also be given to tapping the surplus rural female workforce within economic development , paying special attention to developing township enterprises that are suitable for women , while ensuring good and safe working conditions .  
ACC strongly believes that in the main , and excepting a handful of spectacular emergency cases or where special mandates have been established , the primary role of the resident coordinator as a development professional remains essential .  
The lack of available required cash has also resulted in the occasional temporary borrowing of any temporary excess cash in special peacekeeping accounts to meet the daily operational requirements of those peacekeeping operations with deficits .  
UNHCR undertakes special programmes to protect women and children from sexual violence , abduction , military recruitment , irregular adoption and other forms of threatening and humiliating treatment that may lead to permanent trauma and social breakdown .  
Consideration should be given to supplementary food allowance where , because of special local conditions , the standard daily allowance of 1,000 riels per prisoner is not adequate to secure a proper nutritious diet ;  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
The Holy See approved of the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , which is an expression of the international community 's commitment to fighting violations of human rights , and it expressed its support by making a symbolic contribution to the special fund established by the Secretary-General to finance the activities of the Tribunal .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
In addition to improving the living conditions of thousands of special hardship and other impoverished families , the shelter rehabilitation programme sought to create employment in local construction sectors and to promote refugee self-help by soliciting volunteer labour from beneficiary families in return for provision of materials .  
Previously , the regular programme was divided into three parts : the General Fund per se , funded ongoing activities ( items originally in the General Fund that had received special funding ) and capital and special projects ( investments required to expand and improve the Agency 's capital facilities , and ongoing activities which had received special funding yet which were not part of the Agency 's core activities ) .  
Further , the Assistant Secretary-General noted that the problems produced by rapid urbanization could not be solved by a single level of government ; it required close collaboration between all levels of government and the entire spectrum of civil society .  Of special importance were local authorities , and in that connection , the Assistant Secretary-General made reference to the recently signed " Protocol of Lisbon " between the Centre and prominent international local-government associations .  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
The difficulties involved in meeting , living together and working as equals in an atmosphere of tolerance and cooperation can not conceal the important contribution being made today by the leaders of that Republic under the inspiring leadership of President Mandela , to whom we wish to accord a special recognition for having constructed the democratic foundations of a multiracial and multicultural nation , fully incorporated into the international community . 
As representatives are well aware , the Economic Cooperation Organization is a major regional grouping devoted to the socioeconomic well-being of its 10 member States located in a region of special geo-strategic importance encompassing more than 7-million square kilometres and inhabited by nearly 300-million people .  
In this year in which we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , I would like to lay particular emphasis upon the extremely special nature of this regular contact , an exemplary expression of the close collaboration that should unite the principal organs of the United Nations as they strive to attain the purposes of the Organization .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
My proposal to the Assembly is to create an international United Nations fair-play prize to be awarded every year to the student athlete who , in the judgement of a special committee , has acted most in a spirit of generosity and solidarity with his or her team-mates and competitors and demonstrated the true meaning of fair play in student sporting events throughout the year . 
The Acting President : This morning , the General Assembly will , in accordance with the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting and pursuant to its resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 , devote a special commemorative plenary meeting at its fiftieth session to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance , under sub-item ( b ) of agenda item 112 , Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
In this connection , we are continuing at the State level to formulate plans to minimize the consequences of the accident at Chernobyl improving living standards , increasing medical services and implementing special measures to lower radiation levels in the population with a view to removing limitations on peoples ' lives and activities in the contaminated regions .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for a concerted response from the international community to deal in a more effective manner with the special economic problems of the affected States , I would like to introduce the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 32 , entitled Economic assistance to States affected by the implementation of the Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) .  
Sudan 's multidimensional cooperation with the international community as represented by the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations in ensuring the flow of humanitarian assistance has been the subject of special appreciation by the United Nations as demonstrated in General Assembly resolutions and in the Secretary-General 's report which underscores the success of OLS in assisting all the needy .  
The delegation of Madagascar takes this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General on his concise and accurate report on the special geographical conditions in Madagascar and this region of the Indian Ocean , which is continually exposed to the ravages of tropical cyclones and to the widespread damage caused by these natural disasters .  
Therefore , in that regard , my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee , given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee 's work is progressive , innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social , economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration , and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
At the international level , it was agreed to focus attention on and support the special needs of countries and regions in which there are substantial concentrations of people living in poverty and which , therefore , face serious difficulties in achieving social and economic development .  
The report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 50 / 291 and the special meeting of the First Committee as well as other events traditionally held in observance of Disarmament Week have once again proven that the international community continues to rely on Disarmament Week as an appropriate occasion for further promoting national and international activities to educate and inform the public about major disarmament issues and developments .  
Garc \ x { 71f0 } ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In view of the positive changes that have recently taken place internationally the relaxation of tensions at the global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among nations the way has been paved for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
The international community therefore has a special responsibility to check and curb these illicit arms transfers as a matter of the highest priority , as terrorism has emerged as the principal public enemy , often transcending national boundaries and threatening to tear apart the very fabric of civil society . 
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
While the countries with the largest and most sophisticated nuclear and conventional arsenals have concluded some treaties on nuclear disarmament , it must be emphasized , however , that they have a special responsibility for disarmament and should make further efforts to implement those treaties in earnest so as to bring about further drastic cuts in their nuclear armaments .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Many representatives considered that it was essential to look into the special needs of developing countries and the extra funding needed for implementing measures if the critical areas of concern identified in the Platform for Action were to be addressed effectively .  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
Nationally determined policies for integrated and multifaceted programmes , with special attention to women , to the poorest people living in critical areas and to other vulnerable groups should be implemented , ensuring the involvement of groups with a special potential to act as agents for change and sustainable development .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .  
The long forms included a wide range of specific questions on demographic , social and economic characteristics or on special groups of the population ( for example , persons with a disability ) or were utilized to meet the specific requirements of users .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the High Commissioner attaches special importance to the equal status and human rights of women .  
Such services must be adapted to specific socio-cultural contexts ; be extended to poor women , minorities , unmarried women and adolescents ; promote healthy and responsible reproductive behaviour ; pay special attention to young adults and men ; and promote the use of condoms and other barrier methods of contraception .  
Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .  
Calls upon all Afghans , especially the leaders of warring parties , to agree on an immediate cease-fire and a speedy transfer of power and to support the special mission 's efforts to facilitate national reconstruction , expedite the process leading to the speedy establishment of an acceptable transitional government and restore a fully representative and broad-based government for Afghanistan ;  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and the preparedness against natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Invites the working group on the agenda for development to give consideration to the proposal of the Secretary-General that advantage be taken of the presence of high-level representatives during the early part of the sessions of the General Assembly to conduct a dialogue and to convene special sessions of the Assembly on major themes relevant to the current and emerging economic and social issues in the global agenda , including those identified under the agenda for development ;  
In specific cases , the inclusion of special modules has been accompanied by the redesign of the basic questionnaire or at least parts of it , with the objective of continuing to adapt to changing conditions by incorporating improved techniques of research , and of perfecting the investigation of specific variables .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
Ms . AYKOR , referring to the special temporary measures outlined in paragraph 90 of the report , made the general observation that despite those measures of positive discrimination , the status of individual women continued to be determined by traditional and cultural attitudes .  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , to ensure the strong and independent administration of justice ;  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Expanding basic education by developing special measures to provide schooling to children and youth living in sparsely populated and remote areas , for children and youth of nomadic , pastoral , migrant or indigenous parents , and for street children , children and youth working or looking after younger siblings and disabled or aged parents , and disabled children and youth ; establishing , in partnership with indigenous people , educational systems that will meet the unique needs of their cultures ;  
Implementation of the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of the small-island developing States , in particular by providing effective means including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for social development programmes in accordance with the Barbados Declaration and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Programmes of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Urges the multilateral financial institutions , recipient countries and donor countries , within the conceptual framework and design and implementation of structural adjustment policies in Africa , to pay special attention to eradicating poverty and addressing the social impact of these policies , while focusing on public investment , fiscal reform , reform of public enterprises , export expansion and efficient public administration ;  
The senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Uzbekistan , supporting the efforts of the leadership of Tajikistan to carry out democratic reforms , stressed the special importance in that connection of the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the need for them to be held in accordance with democratic norms , on a multiparty basis , and to ensure the widest possible participation of the various political forces .  
It is expected that the regional intergovernmental workshops planned in preparation for a proposed world conference on sustainable mountain development in 1997 ( see para . 75 below ) will alert Governments and national agencies to the needs and potential for special national mountain agendas .  
One of the main difficulties encountered so far is the lack of adequate recognition of mountain areas as something special , with common problems not shared by lowlands , and therefore worthy of special attention .  The fragility of mountain ecosystems and the adverse impact of the degradation of those ecosystems on lowland populations have not been fully appreciated .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
Increase budgetary allocations for basic health and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the health of girls and women and to rural health programmes ; ( b ) Develop innovative approaches to funding health services through promoting community participation and local financing .  
Governments , non-governmental organizations and private-sector enterprises should take special measures to increase the proportion of women involved in economic decision-making , including studies on the incidence of women in such positions in the public and private sectors , the promotion of training programmes , analysis of alternative policies to provide women with careers leading to economic decision-making , and the adjustment of national legislation .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Also expresses special alarm at the grave violations of human rights in southern Iraq , and urges the Government of Iraq to implement without further delay the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur , including , inter alia , the immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes and the cessation of its military activities against the marsh Arabs , whose survival as a community is endangered ;  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by women of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights attaches special importance to the promotion of the equal status and human rights of women .  
Many representatives considered that it was essential to look into the special needs of developing countries and the extra funding needed for implementing measures if the critical areas of concern identified in the Platform for Action were to be addressed effectively .  
It was agreed that the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in particular input subsidies , needed careful examination , with special attention being paid to distributive problems , especially that of the negative impact on the poor .  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;

" Each State party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide : ( a ) source or special fissionable material , or ( b ) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use , or production of special fissionable material , to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes , unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this article ( IAEA safeguards ) . "  
For exports to a non-nuclear-weapon State not party to the Treaty , source or special fissionable material either directly transferred , or produced , processed , or used in the facility for which the transferred item is intended , shall not be diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Subsequently , the annual overview report of ACC for 1993 stated that , although emergency operations and special assistance projects on behalf of the 21 affected countries had been largely completed , ongoing activities of the relevant components of the United Nations system , within their competence and available resources , continued to take into account the special economic problems of the affected countries ( E / 1994 / 19 , para .  60 ) .  
At its twenty-fifth session , held in April 1994 , the Commission approved the present programme of work , paying special attention to the situation of the economies of the region , which have been characterized by expansion of economic activity with relative price stability , vast inflows of external capital and some relief from the debt burden .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .

UNDP-supported preparatory work for the World Summit for Social Development has involved country-level briefings , workshops and special events ; enabling the production of national reports and position papers ; and active participation at regional and global conferences on the core subjects involved .  
In addition , two special regional workshops / consultations were held for resident coordinators and representatives of United Nations specialized agencies , resulting in practical recommendations for improved coordination and management within the relief-to-development continuum with particular attention to the needs of countries facing situations of complex emergency .  
Invites the international community to continue to lend its political , diplomatic , material and financial support to end the violence , to help the Government of Burundi to find a lasting solution to the political and ethnic tensions and to create conditions to favour the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons and , in this context , requests the Secretary-General to strengthen the office of his special representative in Bujumbura ;  
Such measures vary in range : pricing policies for agricultural inputs required by small farmers in raising their production ; policies regarding access to small credit facilities ; special measures required to make education accessible to children born in remote rural areas who participate in seasonal agricultural activities alongside adults ; elimination of legislative and bureaucratic barriers to the informal sector .  
The transfer of environmentally sound technology , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 , in accordance with chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , is highlighted by the Commission as having a particularly important role to play in realizing the goals of sustainable development .  
The provision ( $ 259,700 ) reflects a negative growth of $ 339,600 and would provide for the external printing costs of the Yearbook of the International Law Commission ( $ 27,700 ) ; and honoraria of the Chairman and 32 members of the Commission , one member being excluded from accepting the payment by national legislation , and additional amounts payable to 6 special rapporteurs , at the rates set by the General Assembly in its resolution 35 / 218 of 17 December 1980 ( $ 232,000 ) .

When the United Nations is unable to provide accommodation to an equivalent standard and the unit rents a suitable structure , the unit will be reimbursed the actual rental cost on a bilateral special case arrangement between the troop-contributing country and the United Nations .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
It is for this reason that I have decided to appoint a resident deputy to my Special Envoy who will assist him in the efforts to find and implement a comprehensive settlement , based on three essential elements : the safe and early return of the refugees and internally displaced persons , maintenance of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia and a special status for Abkhazia .  
They included " Action against national and transnational economic and organized crime and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment : national experiences and international cooperation " , which was considered in a plenary session , with a special session on corruption .  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
The Consultative Committee also published the outcome and proceedings of the special meeting on developing legal and institutional guidelines for privatization and post-privatization regulatory framework , held at Tokyo in January 1994 , which included the draft text of such guidelines .

Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
With regard to item 114 ( b ) of the draft agenda ( Human rights questions : human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ) , the Secretary-General wishes to recall resolution 49 / 213 of 23 December 1994 whereby the General Assembly , inter alia , decided to mark the end of the United Nations Year for Tolerance at a special commemorative plenary meeting of its fiftieth session .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .

The central element of this information programme is the quarterly periodical Africa Recovery , which , along with briefing papers and other publications , focuses on economic and social issues of special concern to Africa and underscores the links between the peace-keeping , humanitarian and developmental activities of the United Nations in Africa .  
Their impact is based on the role entrepreneurship plays in long-term economic growth , on the special role small - and medium-sized enterprises and the informal sector ( where women 's businesses are concentrated ) play in economic development , and on the major social benefits associated with the greater economic autonomy and access to markets and decision-making that are inevitably linked to women 's access to and ability to command resources .

NULLOIOS conducted an investigation into allegations that a senior manager in ONUSAL had abused his authority by : ( a ) appointing a staff member with whom he had a close , personal relationship to a position of Administrative Officer directly reporting to him ; ( b ) granting her a special post allowance based on a fictitious job description ; ( c ) showing favouritism ; and ( d ) contributing to lowering staff morale in the office .  
A special initiative entitled " Intensified cooperation with countries and peoples in greatest need " aims to enable poor countries to establish equitable and sustainable health systems tailored to their specific needs .  
NULLAlthough special programmes and specialized financial institutions are important , their limited coverage means that a sustained impact on the problem of underfunding of micro-enterprises and SMEs calls for more active involvement of commercial banks , which tend to exclude this portion of the population because of the conviction that it is too costly to service .  
NULLConstituting more than half of the population living in absolute poverty , women would thus represent the majority of the beneficiaries targeted by any properly designed micro-entrepreneur and SME development programmes - except where their participation in production and economic activity is constrained by social factors or by special limitations on their access to capital .  
Such emphasis on women is warranted since women , who compose more than half of the world 's poor , often face special legal and social obstructions in carrying out business and economic activities , despite their record of being responsible entrepreneurs and the principal contributors to the welfare of the family .  
NULLIn a number of cases , special rapporteurs appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries and on thematic issues have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
NULLThe practices described in previous reports of arbitrarily rounding up children from the streets of the capital and major towns in northern Sudan and detaining them in special camps usually situated in remote areas continued to take place during the period under examination ( see E / CN . 4 / 1994 / 48 , paras . 89-94 , and E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 58 , paras .  NULL  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
As the Commissioner-General has pointed out , the parties to this process and the major donors to the Agency have asked UNRWA not only to maintain its existing services throughout its area of operations during the interim period , but to play a larger role in helping to effect improvements in the social and economic spheres in which the Agency has acquired a special expertise .  
The main purpose of the definition is not to create a new category of persons having special rights , but to ensure that protections recognized as the rights of persons in certain situations are extended to others in analogous situations and thereby promote a more harmonious and coherent approach to human rights .  
Accordingly , special attention had been paid to strengthening the Organization 's capacity to deal with political and peace-keeping activities , reinforcing international and regional cooperation for development , enhancing support for human rights and humanitarian activities , and increasing internal oversight capacity .  
In this context , the peace agreements set forth specific commitments whose purpose was ( a ) to establish the specific requirements for ending the armed conflict ; ( b ) to tackle some of the root causes of the conflict by starting from democratic principles ; and ( c ) to place special emphasis on the process of reconstruction as part of the economic and social development of the country .  
The Government also described the general legislative measures taken to eliminate racial discrimination in education , the special measures taken to ensure equality and to help the economically disadvantaged , and pointed out its commitment to the goal of providing access to general education for all children , funded by the State at an acceptable level of quality . 
The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance indicated the deep concern raised in the international community by those tendencies , among which " ethnic cleansing " gave special cause for alarm .

However , for real progress to be achieved , my Special Envoy believes that both sides must show concrete signs that they are willing and able to reach and implement a comprehensive settlement , based on three essential elements - the safe and early return of the refugees and internally displaced persons , maintenance of the territorial integrity of Georgia and a special status for Abkhazia .  
An important area of activity of the Chair shall be the progressive development of a nationwide system of permanent education for democracy and peace through human rights , including the elaboration of special educational programmes for members of such services as the army , the police , penitentiary personnel , the teaching profession , public administration , the judiciary , etc .

While stressing the crucial importance of controlling greenhouse gases , he noted that setting reduction objectives without taking into account the possible negative economic impact on developing countries to which the Convention gave special attention could not be regarded as a comprehensive approach for the implementation of the Convention .

Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit-transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Also requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to continue its special role in the field of trade and environment , including analytical and empirical work , conceptual and empirical studies , policy analysis , and consensus-building , with a view to ensuring transparency and coherence in making environmental and trade policies mutually supportive , taking into account the need for continuing close cooperation and complementarity in the work of the Conference , the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Trade Organization ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Also invites the international community to make substantial contributions to the special trust fund established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in order to facilitate the preparations for and holding of the World Food Summit as well as to facilitate the full and effective participation of representatives of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , both at the preparatory meetings for the Summit to be held in January and September 1996 and at the Summit itself ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;

that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
special concern , in this regard , has been the need to determine the full extent of Iraq 's programmes and to seek verification of Iraq 's claims to have destroyed all proscribed weapons , in particular its stocks of agent VX and its precursors , operational missile systems , all of its biological warfare agent and all of the aerial bombs and missile warheads that Iraq states it filled with various chemical and biological agents in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War .  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
In this forum I will limit myself to recalling the significant role of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the natural and constructive approach he had towards existing problems in the African continent , as well as his personal commitment towards charitable organizations with the purpose of raising funds for special social and development projects and programmes .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
The surge in media and public interest during the fiftieth anniversary resulted in the Department 's tripling its production of backgrounders , fact-sheets , notes for speakers and special radio and television programmes , all of which were transmitted through pouch and electronic means to specific audiences worldwide .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
Belize has proposed that we should establish an annual special session of this Assembly immediately prior to the general debate , at which we would discuss development policy and regenerate the political will necessary continually to revise the complex Agenda for Development and the commitments made in this Assembly , as well as at the high-level global conferences of this last decade of the twentieth century .  
Faced with the threat to mankind posed by the rise in sea levels , global warming , creeping desertification and the disappearance of biological diversity , Benin attaches the utmost importance to implementation of all the agreements reached in Rio and , here , renews its commitment to doing all it can to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly planned for June 1997 to strengthen implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Earth Summit contained in Agenda 21 .  
Now that Eritrea has withdrawn its forces from the island of Hanish af-Saghir and the crisis has passed , we would like to express our thanks and appreciation for the role played and efforts made by France and its special envoy , and the positions of the Secretary-General and the President and members of the Security Council , and to all those fraternal and friendly States that declared their support for the principles agreed upon for resolving the conflict peacefully through arbitration . 
If it is first and foremost up to the African countries to demonstrate that their marginalization is determined only by fate and that their current situation is merely one of those tragic aftermaths with which history has frequently sprinkled the course of human events , then it is also up to the international community as a whole , in active solidarity , to make a special commitment to supporting the efforts of the African countries to deal with the challenges before them .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
My delegation therefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing discussions at the current meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a special fund aimed at considerably reducing the multilateral debt of poor countries under structural adjustment result in a successful outcome .  
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
Although southern Africa today enjoys relative peace and stability , it will continue to need special assistance in order to address the problems of reconstruction and development of the economic , physical and social infrastructures which were destroyed or adversely affected by many years of war and racial injustice . 
I should also like to express my special appreciation for the enlightened and committed leadership of your predecessor , Mr . Freitas do Amaral , who , in the course of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly , made an undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the United Nations .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
Thus , we are in no way , and to no degree , inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound reflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing States particularly those in the Caribbean region , where prominent among the features characterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present vulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread devastation resulting therefrom .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
In view of Africa 's marginalization in world trade and considering its obvious disadvantages , particularly in the short and medium terms , following the recently concluded Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the Marrakesh agreements , we call on the international community , and in particular the developed countries , to ensure that implementation of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round provides Africa with special treatment with regard to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms as envisaged therein , as well as in the arrangements of the World Trade Organization .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
The delegation of Ukraine considers that the issue of special economic assistance to countries affected by the sanctions regime should remain on the agenda of the United Nations , taking into account the fact that the previous resolutions on the issue have not been duly implemented , at least with respect to my country , which has not received adequate assistance to cover the tremendous losses caused by its strict and consistent observance of the sanctions regime .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
The political controversy over the timing of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , set at this stage for 1999 , continued in this session and remains closely linked to the desire of a large number of States to focus the special session on further measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Of special significance to my country , and a point we had emphasized in our own presentation to the Court , was the unanimous finding that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session . 
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
But what is more important in the institutional and mechanism frameworks is that the first special session gave the United Nations , and especially the General Assembly , its primary deliberative body , a key role to play in disarmament and greater responsibility in the process of seeking general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
This fourth special session will provide an opportunity to review the question of the comprehensive programme of disarmament , and will allow us to reconsider objectively the impressive architecture contained in the Final Document of the first special session devoted to disarmament , without diverting us from the priorities we collectively established in 1978 .  
We feel that all the working papers submitted and statements made demonstrate the necessity of providing any eventual fourth special session with real and pragmatic content ; otherwise , we will merely be repeating a sterile exercise which , because of its content , would not enjoy consensus among the members of the international community .  
His treatment of the subject of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ( SSOD IV ) integrated well the range of positions held by delegations , further spelt out in thoughtful papers put forward by delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the European Union , and by New Zealand .  
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Operative paragraph 9 recommends that , pursuant to the adopted three-item phased approach , the Disarmament Commission , at its 1996 organizational session , adopt the following items for consideration at its 1997 substantive session : ( a ) the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; ( b ) the fourth special session of the General devoted to disarmament ; and ( c ) the new agenda item on conventional weapons , to be decided by the Disarmament Commission at this session .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development [ 7 ] / it is pointed out that although the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community ,  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
Welcomes with special satisfaction the adoption by the African leaders of the final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty ( the Pelindaba Treaty ) , 5 / which constitutes an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security and which , at the same time , recognizes the right of African countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples ;  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 19 / the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter and its annex to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly , under the agenda items entitled " General and complete disarmament : regional disarmament " , " Review and implementation of the concluding document of the twelfth special session of the General Assembly : regional confidence-building measures " and " Maintenance of international security " , and of the Security Council .  
In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
It was currently preparing an integrated plan of action to combat the so-called " paramilitary " groups that had sown death and terror in rural areas , and planned to reactivate a special armed group capable of tackling those groups successfully .  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
Also requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to continue its special role in the field of trade and environment , including analytical and empirical work , conceptual and empirical studies , policy analysis , and consensus-building , with a view to ensuring transparency and coherence in making environmental and trade policies mutually supportive , taking into account the need for continuing close cooperation and complementarity in the work of the Conference , the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Trade Organization ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Ukraine afforded women equal rights and opportunities in the areas of education and specialized training , labour , remuneration , promotion and socio-political and cultural activities and also implemented special measures to protect the labour and health of women , enable women to combine work with motherhood , and extend legal protection and material and moral support to mothers and children .  
The economic situation in Angola should also be the subject of special attention on the part of the international community , given its specific nature , characterized by a devastating war lasting more than 30 years that has destroyed the entire infrastructure of the country and has disrupted its economic system .  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
Prices of internationally traded goods ( measured in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) ) are expected to change only marginally over the short term , as productivity increases , trade is further liberalized and competitive forces ( including in commodity markets ) contribute to keep global inflationary pressures at bay .  
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
In view of the harsh economic situation , the United Nations Special Coordinator in the occupied territories stated that the standard of living of Palestinians living under the autonomous region of Gaza had declined by 50 per cent since the signing of the Interim Agreement . 8 / A special appeal was launched to the donor community to support the Palestinian authorities in this crucial period . 
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Until special procedures about an aerospace object are prepared , the aerospace object flying in the airspace , especially in a certain State 's territorial airspace , is considered as an aircraft and the aerospace object located in outer space is considered as a space object which is subject to space law .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
Assistant Budget Officer ( P-2 ) .  Reporting to the Budget Officer , the incumbent would be responsible for ( a ) coordinating , collecting and organizing proposed budgets of substantive offices ; ( b ) assisting in the preparation of budgets and performance reports of UNAVEM and the monitoring of allotments ; and ( c ) preparing standard and special financial budgetary reports and related correspondence , as required , for the Chief Administrative Officer .  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
If it was difficult to give proper treatment in an ordinary detention centre , or if a special or a long-term treatment was required , a patient would be sent to special detention institutions where sufficient medical treatment was available .  
The key elements of the plan included an agreed ratio of IPTF to Federation police in the various areas ; the issuance of special identity cards for Federation police authorized and cleared by IPTF ; a change in the composition of the Federation police in each suburb to reflect the ethnic mix of the population according to the 1991 census ; IPTF authorization of Federation police check-points ; and requests in advance for searches of houses or private property .  
During the special plenary session of the Congress devoted to technical cooperation , it was stated that technical cooperation was indispensable to building and supporting both democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems .  
In its resolution 4 / 1 of 9 June 1995 , entitled " Succession of States in respect of international treaties on combating various manifestations of crime " , the Commission emphasized the special importance of the consistent and effective implementation of international instruments on combating crime , and called upon successor States to confirm to appropriate depositories that they will continue to be bound by obligations under relevant international treaties on combating various manifestations of crime , to which their predecessor States were parties .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Those amendments also introduced a requirement for banks and special financial institutions to report to the competent authorities all transfers abroad of Turkish lira and foreign currency exceeding US $ 50,000 or its equivalent , except in the case of exports , imports and invisible transactions .  
Other elements identified as important , especially as regards sex crime , were : the adoption of adequate legislation ; the setting-up of special offices at police stations with separate facilities ; the provision of assistance and especially trained practitioners to handle female victimization ; conducting specialized , multifaceted training courses ; setting up specialized police units ; establishing national reference centres to collect and analyse data and effectively monitor , prevent and suppress the phenomenon ; education ; coordination ; and information dissemination .  
As one form of outreach , set up special advisory centres for women and the girl child who might be in trouble or in difficult or irregular situations , including those involved in drug abuse or illicit trafficking , those engaged in prostitution and pornography , runaways , street children , the homeless and those experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma ;  
Where alternative programmes target special population groups , however , their success rate is high , equal to the peer-led programmes and with better results than conventional drug education programmes . 35 The successful programmes are those that have been individualized to meet the needs of each client and those that have included activities to enhance personal competence , such as reading skills and job skills , as well as physical adventure .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
Along those lines , it was suggested that the requirement should be limited to sensitive areas of public service or to cases where an abuse of power might be suspected and that the last sentence should be revised to read : " All information provided shall be treated as confidential but may be disclosed at a country 's discretion within the framework of special procedures . "  
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .

Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development it is pointed out that while the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , and particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community , 
The legal system should be made more sensitive and responsive to the needs and special circumstances of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in order to ensure a strong and independent administration of justice ;  
In this area , special attention must be paid to the challenges inherent in improving the quality of services and strengthening social integration through the organized participation of civil society in the formulation of policies and programmes and in control over their management .  
Among them were the following : their removed location from sources of information and special components ; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements ; the lack of qualified suppliers , which resulted in more expensive in-house process development ; and a less efficient country infrastructure .  
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
Non-governmental organizations in general consultative status , special consultative status and on the Roster which express their wish to attend the international conferences convened by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , and the meetings of the preparatory bodies of said conferences , shall be accredited for participation .  
The Commission also continued to study the distributive aspects of economic development , with special emphasis on analysing the effects of adjustment processes on income distribution ; public policies aimed at changing production patterns and promoting sustainable development and social equity , with an emphasis on assessing their effectiveness in those different spheres .  
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
If two adjoining countries do not agree on a set of common rules on how goods passing through each other 's territory will be treated , then national law will prevail in each case , and a motor vehicle , for example , might be subject to multiple unnecessary inspections , might require different insurance coverage , might be subject to special license requirements , etc .  
It is truly regrettable that the Security Council , which bears special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , should see fit to delete these items without heed for their objective and historical value and without prior consultation with the States concerned .  
INFOTERRA , the Global Environmental Information Exchange Network , is operating through 171 government-designated national focal points ; a network of 8,000 sources of information , including national and international institutions , non-governmental organizations , industrial and commercial enterprises , academic institutions and experts ; 34 special sectoral sources , and 10 regional service centres .  
As part of the plan , which involved the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and several international non-governmental organizations , relief food and essential drugs were provided to vulnerable groups , seeds and tools were distributed to farming families , special feeding centres were set up and vaccination campaigns were conducted .  
As stated in the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( see A / 50 / 361 , paras . 44-49 , despite several cases of application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations , in connection with sanctions against Southern Rhodesia , Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , there is no uniform and internationally recognized methodology for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of non-target States affected by the implementation of mandatory economic sanctions .  
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
Although no substantive intergovernmental or inter-agency discussion on the subject has yet taken place , the recent conceptual analyses and specific case studies have featured several basic principles or criteria for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of States arising from the implementation by them of sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
Accordingly , the Secretary-General addressed letters , in July and September of 1993 and January of 1994 , to the executive heads of the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial organizations ( the World Bank and IMF ) and the regional development banks , requesting them to provide him with updated information on activities undertaken by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States .  
As reported in the annual overview report for 1993 , the information received regarding additional measures or special assistance in response to the immediate hardships encountered and urgent needs faced by the affected countries was largely of a preliminary nature , which reflected the need to assess the extent of the impact of sanctions on the economies of the affected countries in order to assist them in developing appropriate policy responses and in preparing financial requirements for remedial measures . 
Invites the financial and trade institutions participating in the high-level segment of the Council in 1997 to furnish relevant special reports and studies on the selected theme , within their respective mandates and areas of expertise , and on important developments in the world economy and in international economic cooperation ;  
Coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy , the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime more than four years ago now continue to exert their negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in the country .  
There were also those who considered that , in view of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the profound and far-reaching changes that have transformed the international security landscape since the end of the cold war era , and the advent of a new century , profitable use could be made of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to review and assess progress towards the " grand vision " and programme of action of the Final Document .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
Also in that resolution , the General Assembly renewed its invitation to the international financial institutions to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on those States .  
The Assembly renewed its request to the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to take into consideration , in programming their development activities , the special needs of the affected States and to consider providing assistance to them from their special programme resources , and renewed its appeal to all States , on an urgent basis , to provide technical , financial and material assistance to the affected States to mitigate the adverse impact of the sanctions on their economies .  
The Committee , taking into account difficulties encountered in ensuring adequate preparation of meetings , including timely distribution of documentation , as well as the ability of Member States to participate fully , recommends that the General Assembly should instruct the Main Committees to review the number of special conferences of the United Nations already proposed and scheduled in their respective fields of activity prior to deciding upon the scheduling of new and additional special conferences , thus bearing in mind the relevant portions of General Assembly resolution 33 / 55 . "

The International Council on Social Welfare , made up of a wide range of local , national and international organizations with special interests on issues related to social welfare and social development , adopted Summit follow-up as its top priority and held regional follow-up seminars for non-governmental organizations in Africa , Asia Pacific , Latin America and Europe .  
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1566 ( L ) , the Council considered that the ultimate goal of the work of the Commission should be the achievement of an integrated system in the collection , data processing and dissemination of international statistics by the organs and agencies of the United Nations system with special regard to the requirements of reviewing and appraising economic and social progress , taking into account the needs of the developing countries . 
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The Assembly requested relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions to strengthen their efforts to assist interested developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national water policies and strategies , and called upon the international community to give special attention to the revitalization of economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries , through , inter alia , a more diversified food and agriculture sector .  
It has established national committees in more than 80 countries , and through its regular meetings and special seminars has played a major role in the exchange of experience and technical information on the sustainable use and conservation of water in food production .  
The intermediate amount of anticipatory pension consists of a basic amount , a pension supplement and a disablement allowance which is to cover the special expenses connected with the physical or mental disabilities , just as the amount is considered to partly compensate for the lack of working capacity . 
While all those procedural aspects are covered in a special chapter ( comprising a number of articles ) in other principal human rights treaties , in the case of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which does not have a treaty-based standing , more than a dozen Council resolutions and decisions were needed to complement the text of the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . Owing to this special " legal " situation , a decision by the Council could terminate the Committee 's existence .  
While the Bureau agreed that the rules of procedure needed to be fully respected and that specific decisions on the participation of major groups in the session would be taken by the General Assembly , it also agreed that a number of activities could be organized during the special session with a view to ensuring effective input of major groups and their active inter-action with government representatives .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 113 invited all relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including multilateral financial institutions and WTO , to contribute to the special session , and requested the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session .  
The Committee agreed that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant bodies , should actively contribute to making the special session a highly visible international event that would energize global commitment to the implementation of Agenda 21 and advance international dialogue and action for sustainable development .  
During the fifth session of the Commission , one possibility would be to organize , in parallel with the drafting groups that will work on the text of the final document of the special session , hearings involving representatives of Governments , major groups and eminent persons , devoted to an assessment of the existing and potential role , and contribution to its implementation , of each of the major groups identified in Agenda 21 .

That concern arose from their commitment to decolonization and the rights of the indigenous Kanaks , including the preservation and promotion of their social and cultural values , which had been reflected in the South Pacific Forum vision statement and the " Melanesia beyond 2000 " strategy which declared that the four Member States and the Front de lib �� ation nationale Kanake socialiste ( FLNKS ) were determined to support the orderly decolonization of New Caledonia with special safeguards for the indigenous Kanaks .  
These committees , which operate as special committees of the works councils , are tripartite in structure : in addition to the representatives of management and staff , their members include health and safety officials , i.e . the in-house doctor , the regional health and safety information officer , the head of security and , where applicable , the establishment 's social assistant ; not to mention experts on prevention of industrial accidents and occupational diseases , whom the committee can consult at any time .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .

The Commissioner-General held an extraordinary meeting of major donors and host Governments in Amman on 23 September 1996 .  
The Secretary-General attached special importance to the role of the Council in promoting a coordinated and integrated follow-up to major international conferences , and was confident that the outcome of the Council 's work in 1996 would further enhance its responsibility to draw together in a coherent framework the results of all major United Nations conferences to ensure that they guide the activities of the United Nations system .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
In addition , a special State programme had been drawn up to address the cultural , spiritual , educational and socio-economic problems of the 12-million ethnic Ukrainians living abroad .

At its fifty-second session , the Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 71 , of 23 April 1996 expressed its outrage that the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape had been used as a weapon of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized that rape in the context of armed conflict constituted a war crime and called for the protection and care of rape victims , respect for the special needs of victims of sexual violence in the investigation and prosecution of alleged violations and punishment of those responsible . 
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,

As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .  
Many special representatives and envoys were retained on a " when actually employed " ( WAE ) basis , by which their services were retained by the Organization when there was a need for work of an intermittent or discontinuous nature ; for assignments whose duration was uncertain , or whose timing was not clearly identifiable in advance ; or to ensure the availability at short notice of persons with special skills required by the Organization .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .

of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties .

Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Although the special circumstances of developing countries are recognized in many specific instances throughout the revised version , there is no separate chapter or annex devoted to those circumstances ( as in the previous version ) .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
It was essential to monitor the efficacy of the international human rights norms that were the basis of the work of the treaty bodies and the efficacy of the special procedures and thematic machinery which played an irreplaceable role in the effective promotion and protection of human rights .  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;

The Chinese Government , while committing itself to the promotion of economic development , had strengthened the country 's democracy and legal system , with special attention to economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights .  
This form of action has been of special importance in view of the precarious social and economic situation , which has been compounded by the impact on the country of mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the unilateral economic blockade from the south . 
As respect for fundamental rights and freedoms was an essential precondition for peace and security in the world , and for the prevention of international disputes and conflicts , Governments must , in order to strengthen international human rights monitoring machinery , report in a timely fashion on the manner in which they fulfilled their treaty obligations and must be required to cooperate with the United Nations special rapporteurs , working groups and experts .  
The principles elaborated in the above-mentioned administrative instruction on non-reimbursable loans for technical cooperation projects ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) , particularly in terms of an agreement or understanding between the United Nations and the donor and the issuance of a special service agreement with the individual , have been applied only in a limited number of cases .  
Gratis personnel have also been accepted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services ; their functions have included auditing and ensuring compliance with recommendations of the Office ; their contractual relationship to the United Nations is established by a special service agreement ; since support costs have not been charged to the donor Governments , those costs have fallen upon the regular budget .  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
It was also essential to ascertain the truth about the thousands of missing persons ; to assist the victims of genocide , rape and abuse ; and to bring to justice all instigators and perpetrators of crimes against humanity and grave violations of international humanitarian law .  NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
To give attention to the rights and needs of adolescent girls , which call for special actions for their protection from sexual exploitation and abuse , harmful cultural practices , teenage pregnancy and vulnerability to sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , and for the development of life skills and self-esteem , reaffirming that the advancement and empowerment of women throughout the life cycle must begin with the girl child at all ages ;

Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 10 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;

Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;

I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
Thus , the special measures announced by ST / SGB / 282 and set out in ST / AI / 412 were developed with the objective of achieving for women equality of opportunity to participate , in the light of the established fact that , since the earliest days of the Secretariat , men colleagues have always far outnumbered their women colleagues at the Professional and , particularly , at the decision - and policy-making levels .  
Additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which included but were not limited to electrical , mechanical and special systems requirements , namely , uninterrupted power supply , building automated control and anti-intrusion security ;  
Panama recommends the inclusion of provisions , as very special legislation , that are directed at committing States to social policy allocating greater budgetary resources to finance institutions for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of children who are victims of armed conflicts , and supports efforts to implement State social policy giving concrete form to the real will of Governments .

Encouraged [ countries to explore ] [ exploration of ] the feasibility of innovative financial packages , such as [ special ] [ voluntary ] [ partnerships for forests ] [ partnerships for SFM ] , [ based on pooled resources ] [ supporting [ comprehensive forest programmes ] [ national forest programmes ] ] , through further study and national pilot programmes ;  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .  Replace the tables in paragraph ( b ) ( i ) by the following :

Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
Direct negotiations are sometimes allowed under exceptional circumstances , such as when for special reasons competitive methods would not lead to satisfactory results , or in the case of projects with an anticipated initial investment value not exceeding a certain amount or of a limited duration .  
An appropriate legal framework for the settlement of those disputes may be provided by means of special legislation , based on internationally accepted standards , governing international commercial arbitration and reflecting particular needs of international arbitration .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
Under subprogramme 2 , analytical support will be provided to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and its subsidiary bodies through regular reports on trends and patterns in illicit drug production , trafficking and abuse and through other reports as requested , including those required in connection with the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1998 .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
That exclusion was largely acceptable because insolvencies of financial services institutions usually required prompt and discrete action ( for instance to avoid massive withdrawals of deposits ) and were , for that reason , administered under special regulatory regimes in various States .  
At its 10th plenary meeting , on 4 April 1997 , however , the Council decided , in order to allow the secretariat sufficient time to complete the tasks assigned to it by the Council at its nineteenth session , that the dates of the special session should not be fixed as yet but that it should be held over a three-day period between late 1997 and the end of January 1998 .  
By section I , paragraph 12 of its decision 19 / 22 , the Council approved an extraordinary additional appropriation of Fund resources in 1998-1999 of up to $ 1-million for the management and administrative support costs budget , $ 500,000 of which would be earmarked for the costs associated with the anticipated special session in the event that they were not covered by the United Nations regular budget .  
The instrument should be developed in such a manner as to recognize ongoing activities on persistent organic pollutants and other related issues and institutions , as well as differing regional and national conditions and taking into account the special concerns of developing countries and countries with economies in transition ;  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
In preparing for the special session the Governments of Member States should demonstrate their political will in practical terms by intensifying their efforts to eliminate poverty in general , eradicate absolute poverty , increase employment and decrease unemployment and by deepening social integration in their respective countries .  
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
At the same time , States are moving towards establishing the individual penal responsibility of those who commit extremely grave international crimes , through the creation of special courts and the forthcoming establishment of an international criminal court .  
Indeed , at its nineteenth special session , devoted to the consideration of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly stressed that in order to promote participatory processes in the area of economic and social development , the participation of national legislative assemblies was indispensable .  
At the same time , the reform process must assign special importance to measures and mechanisms designed to accelerate economic and social development , especially in Africa , by supporting domestic efforts at economic restructuring , diversification of raw materials and increased food security being carried out by the countries of the region . 
In his annual report on the work of the Organization ( A / 52 / 1 ) , the Secretary-General considered that post-conflict situations have special requirements and that successful recovery from disturbances caused by conflicts is assisted by facing up quickly to general development challenges , and the provision of appropriate legal frameworks , stable social and political environments and economic opportunities .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
In our view , special attention should be paid in the charter to the security interests of States that have not joined military and political alliances and have not expressed the desire to join such alliances in the foreseeable future .  
The latest initiative to Judaize East Jerusalem with the building of a new Jewish settlement on Arab land in Jebel Abu Ghneim , in a highly symbolic place , is a deliberate provocation in the light of the relevant resolutions adopted by overwhelming majority of the international community at the two urgent meetings of the General Assembly and at its emergency special session .  
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
Armenia hopes that this special session will take decisions to further integrate environmental and social concerns into the day-to-day regulatory tools of the international economy , and thus ensure that quality of life issues are addressed in a way more likely to lead to their successful resolution .  
Regarding energy as a substantive topic , it was considered vital to take into account a number of pertinent issues , such as the uneven distribution of fuel and energy resources , the interactive management of energy , energy savings , the problems related to biomass sources from contaminated forests and the need for a total energy system , and the special needs of small island countries .  
Their tenuous situation has frequently been exacerbated as special programmes to promote their participation in the labour force and as basic services and social safety nets have been weakened or dismantled in order to meet strict budgetary requirements .  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , 8 the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames , wherever feasible , for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly . 
During the period under review , the special process received a total of 3,058 cases through non-governmental organizations and field offices , which were considered , processed and transmitted to the authorities allegedly held responsible .

At the informal consultations held on 15 January 1997 at a briefing by UNDCP for permanent missions to the United Nations ( Vienna ) , there was agreement that the bureau of the special segment ( preparatory body ) should be distinct from that of the regular segment ( functional commission ) and should remain in office until the special session .  
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
The basic principles of the negotiations are recognized as dialogue , mutual and continuing respect between the parties , voluntary resettlement of individuals , non _ discrimination , observance of the letter and spirit of the peace agreements , protection of the environment , maximum social benefit , preferential and special treatment of vulnerable groups , and community participation .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .

The priorities pursued , which the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse , include a multidisciplinary approach , involving social services and mental health workers , to interviewing and investigation , special treatment in court settings which are child-friendly and appropriate to age and status , and continuing care in order to address the lingering effects of commercial sexual exploitation .  Measures are to be reinforced through education systems which provide children with skills and opportunities as a preventive strategy .  
Through its special hardship programme , UNRWA provided material and financial aid to refugee families who met the UNRWA criteria of being without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other financial support sufficient to cover basic needs , which represented 5.4 per cent of the registered refugee population .  
Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
Specific , reliable actions within the context of well-established programmes with clearly defined goals deserve special attention .  In conclusion , all partners - Governments , national and international organizations , churches , women and men must make a commitment to ensure that Zairian women and men will work together , hand in hand , for a harmonious society and a credible and prosperous country .  
In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .  
Recommends that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty and the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .

Following the precedent of the seventeenth special session , the preparatory body may wish to recommend that the vice-presidents of the upcoming special session should be the same as those of the fifty-second regular session of the General Assembly , on the understanding that the regional groups may make substitutions of the vice-presidents allocated to each group .  
The Assembly , in the same section of that resolution , stressed that the special session should " be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation . . . , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 [ 1 ] and other relevant conventions and international instruments " .

The Advisory Committee also devoted considerable attention to extrabudgetary funds in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,9 where it addressed the presentation of information on trust funds in the budget document , the primacy of United Nations regulations and rules with regard to any conditions attached to special purpose contributions and the need for a standard format and procedures for reporting on trust funds to donors with a view to reducing the administrative burden and excessive overheads .

Although we were not entirely satisfied with the results of the recent nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held last summer , it is important that that session outlined ways of expediting progress in key areas of sustainable development , as defined in Agenda 21 .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .

Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .

Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
Having regard to the major disarmament and non-proliferation conferences already scheduled for the remaining years of the decade and to the need to concentrate scarce resources on specific and focused disarmament events and on goals attainable in the short term , consensus on the timing of another special session on disarmament and broad agreement on its objectives are vital to the prospects of success .  
There is an imperative need to continue to build on the agreements already reached and for concerted efforts focused on unresolved issues which should be addressed at the forthcoming fourth special session on disarmament , as they represent a continuing threat to international peace and security .  
In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
In the view of Argentina , before deciding to convene the special session , and after having carefully studied its financial implications , it would be advisable to ensure the proper preparation of the session and provide it with some real content so that we do not repeat past mistakes .  
It is therefore a timely and an opportune moment to hold this emergency special session of the General Assembly , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 377 ( V ) , entitled Uniting for peace , to deliberate on this crucial issue and all its essential aspects .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
At the recent XII Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , held at New Delhi , which concluded just a little over two weeks ago , the Non-Aligned Movement member countries had the privilege of hearing President Arafat in a special session of the ministerial conference , give a detailed presentation on the state of the peace process in the Middle East and the implications of the construction of the settlement by Israel at Jabal Abu Ghneim to the south of East Jerusalem . 
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
In July this year , earlier in this the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , my delegation emphasized , among other things , that it is not possible to divorce the complete nationhood of the Palestinian people from a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
The Centre for Family Friendly Cities of the University of Akron , Ohio , United States of America , created an interactive communications network on the World Wide Web designed to store , search and retrieve information on , inter alia , family relationships , sexuality and reproduction , special problems and risk factors , family counselling and education , cultural social and urban issues , basic needs , leisure and entertainment , consumption and sustainable development and work .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Numerous administrative circulars in the public and semi _ public services and authorities lay down discriminatory treatment for the immigrant population , among them ANPE ( the National Employment Agency ) , ASSEDIC ( Family Allowance funds ) and the Social Security Offices , which are required to carry out special checks and to demand supporting documents and even systematically to inform on immigrants to a specialized department in the prefectures .  
Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close . 
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
The safety of space NPS at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents will be ensured by safety systems and NPS structural elements designed to meet safety requirements , and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
Requests the International Civil Service Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the United Nations common system , including consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
Some States observed that on a technical level , aerospace objects should not be considered as aircraft because they were designed to be spacecraft with special procedures for design , construction and launch different from those applying to aircraft , not to mention that their flexibility and capability to manoeuvre as aircraft was only incidental to their intended use .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
L . As in the case of question 4 , although there seem to be differences of opinion as to whether or not the distinct phases require different degrees of regulation , it was apparent from the substantive comments received that if a special regime for aerospace objects were to be discussed and formulated , all aspects mentioned by the respondents could be incorporated into appropriate language for such a special regime .  
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
In addition to the Special Rapporteur 's participation in the special rapporteurs ' meeting and in joint urgent actions transmitted to Governments , in 1996 the Special Rapporteur requested to undertake a joint mission to Nigeria with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
At its fifty _ second session the Commission on Human Rights decided , without a vote , that all continuing thematic or country _ oriented mandates established by the Commission and entrusted to special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups are expected to report to the fifty _ third session ( decision 1996 / 113 ) .  
One issue that warrants special attention relates to the new firms which have been operating in several countries and whose formal lawfulness , in the light of the relevant national and international legislation , is not open to question , as they are covered by the gaps and loopholes that would prevent their activities from being classified as mercenary stricto sensu . 
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .  
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Invites Governments to accord standard minimum humanitarian treatment to trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards and , with the support of the United Nations , to formulate manuals for the training of personnel who receive and / or hold in temporary custody victims of gender _ based violence , including trafficking , with a view to sensitizing them to the special needs of victims ;  
On the initiative of the Government of Togo , the Central Organ of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution , meeting at the ministerial level during the sixty-fifth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of OAU , held in Tripoli from 24 to 28 February 1997 , decided to hold in Lom a special session of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Central Organ in order to consider the situation in the Great Lakes region , with particular reference to eastern Zaire .  
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .  
The solution to the problem of terrorism lay in addressing its root causes , as reaffirmed in any number of General Assembly resolutions , such as 40 / 61 and 46 / 51 , which urged States to pay special attention to situations involving flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and those involving alien domination and foreign occupation , that might give rise to international terrorism .  
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women and specifically address the special needs of girls and women as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents , rural and urban poor , persons in remote or neglected areas , and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
Further reaffirms that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Reaffirms that , within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty , special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty , to the national and international framework conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication , which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , including the right to development ;  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
When ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to the present Convention , or at any time thereafter , a Party which is not a regional economic integration organization may declare in a written instrument submitted to the Depositary that , in respect of any dispute not resolved in accordance with paragraph 2 , it recognizes as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement in relation to any Party accepting the same obligation :  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
The President : Members will recall that , during the consultations I held pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 181 , Member States expressed an understanding that I would select non-governmental-organization representatives of major groups , as identified in Agenda 21 , to participate in the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly according to certain criteria . 
Therefore , the medium-term plan focused on the continuing need to improve the living conditions of all people , especially the poor and disadvantaged population groups , in both rural and urban settlements , with special attention given to the development needs of the least developed countries and of countries with economies in transition .  
The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
The High Contacting Parties shall ensure favourable conditions for direct trade and other economic relations and cooperation at the level of administrative and territorial units in accordance with national legislation currently in force , devoting special attention to the development of economic ties between border regions .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
The official results of the elections were announced on 30 April 1997 and confirmed by the Electoral Appeals Commission , which reported that most complaints received were addressed by the special measures adopted by the Transitional Administrator on election day , or dismissed after due consideration . 
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
Nationally and regionally coordinated strategies should be developed for the implementation of the mandates and recommendations contained in the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session , 1 / on 23 February 1990 , the Tehran Declaration adopted by the Ministerial-level Conference at the twenty-ninth session of the Subcommission , held at Tehran in 1992 , and other relevant international drug control instruments ;  
However , in complex or overtly political situations , such as Cambodia , southern Sudan , northern Iraq and the former Yugoslavia , special arrangements were put in place on a case _ by _ case basis , including the designation of a lead agency to coordinate the international humanitarian response .  
As of 30 June , the office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson had opened 1,692 provisional files , registered 713 cases , issued 10 final reports in individual cases and eight special reports ; 38 requests for interim measures have been successful , and 21 have not been implemented by the authorities . 
Another major component of that institutional framework was the Ministry of Women and Children 's Affairs , whose role included national policy formulation , implementation of special programmes , women 's legal and social rights , registration of voluntary organizations and dealing with international organizations .  
The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961 had amended Muslim personal law by modifying inheritance provisions , prohibiting additional marriages after the first marriage without permission from an Arbitration Council constituted according to the Ordinance , imposing procedural restrictions before divorce became effective , prescribing a special procedure for determining the amount of maintenance payable by a husband to his wife and modifying provisions concerning dowers .  
The reaffirmation contained in the Final Document of the Fourth Review Conference is of special importance to Cuba , in that the use by States parties , in any way and under any circumstances , of microbial or other biological agents or toxins that is not consistent with prophylactic , protective or other peaceful purposes , is effectively a violation of article I of the Convention .  
The Ministers reviewed the activities of CPLP , with special focus on the plan of action of the Executive Secretariat , as approved by the Ministerial Meeting held in New York on 26 September 1996 , and they reaffirmed their confidence in CPLP as a privileged instrument for consolidating , developing and enhancing their common historical ties , on the basis of the shared principles of peace , democracy , social justice and economic progress . 
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
Urges Governments and non _ governmental , national and international organizations to collect and disseminate gender _ disaggregated statistics and indicators to monitor the representation and participation of women at all levels of political , economic and social life , with special attention to the impact of the multiple barriers faced by many women who exist at the intersection of discrimination , based on race , gender and poverty ;  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and in particular to its Chairperson _ Rapporteur , Ms . Erica _ Irene Daes , for the important and constructive work accomplished during its fifteenth session ; 2 .  Requests the Secretary _ General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its fifteenth session to indigenous organizations , Governments and intergovernmental and non _ governmental organizations concerned , as well as to all thematic rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups ;  
The Committee had proposed that at its 1997 session the advisory committee should finalize the agenda and work out the organizational aspects of the special session and a schedule of events , as well as outlining the desirable form of participation of relevant international , regional and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in the preparatory work .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
The purpose of the special session should not be to renegotiate Agenda 21 or to redefine the principles and objectives of sustainable development , but rather to identify priority sectoral issues that required follow-up at the international level .  The outcomes of other United Nations conferences held since the Rio Conference should also be taken into account in order to avoid duplication of ongoing work or work which had already been implemented in other international forums .  
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
The Group of 77 and China also fully supported the World Food Summit , at which the most serious problems were to be considered and addressed and the special session of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the commitments assumed under Agenda 21 , which would provide the international community with an excellent opportunity to study the principal obstacles to the effective implementation of the Rio agreements . 
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
The competence of the Tribunal may also be extended , with the approval of the General Assembly , to any other international organization or entity established by a treaty and participating in the common system of conditions of service , upon the terms set out in a special agreement between the organization or entity concerned and the Secretary-General of the United Nations .  
The Agency had agreed in March 1996 to permit the survey of UNRWA vehicles as a pragmatic , temporary and exceptional measure only .  Moreover , despite the establishment of a special VIP / international organizations lane at the Erez checkpoint and UNRWA 's agreement to a magnetic card system which was proposed to expedite crossings , the search procedures continued to result in time-consuming delays for UNRWA staff and , on occasion , damage to UNRWA vehicles .  
Other findings included continued recruitment from a narrow geographical base with apparently no attempt to diversify recruitment sources as prescribed by existing policies , finalization of special service agreements during or even after the consultancy in many cases and high consultancy fees .  
This was recognized by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session when it stated , with reference to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development , that transparent and participatory processes should be promoted when integrating economic , social and environmental objectives and that this will require the involvement of national legislative assemblies ( resolution S-19 / 2 , annex , para . 24 ( b ) ) .  
Research in policy development will enable Member States to respond to the global problem of ATS by means of improving the international drug-control system through the action plan against manufacture , trafficking and abuse of ATS for the special session of the General Assembly , and its operationalization and continuing scientific work to keep abreast of the perpetually changing ATS issue .  
Activities include : preparing working documents and a draft report of the Board on the implementation of article 12 of the 1988 Convention ; providing Governments with relevant information to determine the legitimacy of shipments of precursor chemicals and to advise them regarding decisions on specific suspicious shipments ; preparing critical review documents and other relevant materials for the Board and its advisory expert group and for establishing a limited international special surveillance list ; and providing substantive advice on activities related to precursor control .  
The International Monitoring Committee and MISAB were invited to participate in a special commission , beginning on 5 October , in seeking a viable and satisfactory solution to the transfer of the school for the children being raised by the Army to an appropriate site with a view to settling the delicate question of this group of young people in the Central African Republic , which is a breeding ground for future members of the Armed Forces . It should be mentioned that some of the children attending the school had joined the ranks of the rebels . 
In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
It guided the substantive preparations for the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem , held in New York from 8 to 10 June 1998 , which represented a major landmark in international efforts to achieve a drug-free world .  
Further attention was drawn to the need to establish arrangements for special investigative techniques , such as electronic surveillance , undercover operations and controlled deliveries , as practical tools to penetrate criminal organizations .  
The meeting had been devoted to three themes : the creation of a favourable environment for the emancipation of teenage girls ; the special need for social protection of adolescent girls ; and teenage health , including sexual and reproductive health .  
In the efforts to find a fair and effective solution to the external debt crisis , a differential approach , based on the special problems of each individual State , should be applied .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
The girl child was added as the twelfth critical area during the preparatory process , as a result of regional preparations and of pressure to recognize that true progress could be realized only if the next generation was also the subject of special attention .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
In its preliminary conclusions and recommendations , the paper stated that human rights education , with special emphasis on racial discrimination , should not be confined to public and private schools and universities .  
Holders of special procedures mandates have refined their methods of work ; increased the frequency of their country visits ; initiated , in some cases , comprehensive comparative analytical studies ; and developed procedures for handling individual complaints .  
They included , for example , poverty , gender discrimination and the difficulties faced by children in need of special protection , whether institutionalized , living in the streets , involved in armed conflicts or substance abuse , exploited and abused , etc .  
To eliminate the need to import expensive ready-made prosthetic components from abroad , ICRC has introduced new materials and developed special moulds to facilitate low-cost production at the local or regional level .
