He inspected a number of key projects built with aid provided by units of armed forces .  He also took part in voluntary tree planting and met with leading cadres at or above the division level from units stationed in Xinjiang and Shaanxi .  
" The success of this two-pronged approach is evidenced by the fact that we have not only raised sufficient revenue to meet our spending needs but we have also built up a very healthy level of fiscal reserves . 
The consultants examined a number of options including the use of the existing public transport interchange of Hung Hom Station and the construction of a direct link to the Princess Margaret Road extension , and concluded that the only feasible traffic solution would be to link the proposed tower block with the podium to be built above the freight yard site i.e . making use of the vehicular access of the original freight yard project . 
The cottages were built by approved building contractors , or by voluntary agencies , according to standard layout plans and designs , and then allocated or sold by them to eligible squatters registered by the relevant authorities .

The new museum is located at the ruins of the Lei Yue Mun Fort , which was a defence work built by the British army in the 19th century .  The SAR Government has preserved and maintained the historical relics , and has rebuilt it into a museum for the benefit of the public , so that they may have a better understanding of Hong Kong 's coastal defence .  It is undoubtedly another cultural contribution to our community .  
Mr Joseph Liu , now aged 66 , has a keen interest in astronomy since youth .  In the early 70 ' , he built a private observatory equipped with a self-designed 32-cm reflecting telescope in the backyard of his house in the New Territories . The stunning and magnificent lunar and planetary photographs taken had earned him reputation in the astronomy circle .

" The combined effect of all this was that mud , which had accumulated in a section of the underground piping , was washed into the in-service water main of the residential blocks , contaminating the potable water supply , " he explained .  Other possible factors have also been identified to have contributed to the incident , including the change of contractor ( due to liquidation of the original contractor ) where no handover of works and as built records had been made between the contractors .  
For more than a decade the Troupe has trained up a batch of outstanding performers and built up a remarkable repertoire , and developed a unique artistic tradition of immense vigour , passion and crudeness .  
International speakers had been invited to Hong Kong to discuss what it means to be human and how human values are defined in the twenty-first century , together with the issues of our ( post ) information age , telecommunication and cybersphere , the anthropogenetic domain of built environment and material urban landscape , digital beings in a so-called post-human condition which humans have collectively created and inhabited .  
Our ability to meet these challenges and to sustain economic success is built upon the rule of law , a clean , transparent and accountable government , the free flow of information , a free and tolerant society , adherence to the prevailing international standards and a level playing field for all .  
" The second aim is to achieve what our private sector counterparts would understand as a successful purchase , which is determined by whether the most suitable products are acquired for the end-users ' needs , at advantageous prices and terms of supply , from reliable suppliers who are committed to customer satisfaction , and with sufficient flexibility built in to allow for new technology and other unforeseen developments , " she explained .

This is the first set of embossed stamps issued in Hong Kong . Four major waterworks and facilities are depicted , namely Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir built on land ( $ 1.3 ) ; Plover Cove Reservoir , the world 's first massive reservoir carved out of the sea ( $ 2.5 ) ; large diameter water pipelines for transferring water received from Guangdong ( $ 3.1 ) and application of modern technology to the controlling and monitoring of water quality ( $ 5.0 ) .  
The show is conceived as a series of fabulous danced tales telling an eternal story , which is universal but simple .  Through unusual light , music and song , splendid bodies and gestures , " The Water Carriers " unveils a continuity between water and the world .  It is a dream built around water on " how to find again the wave that slakes the thirst . . . that drop of water sufficiently powerful to create a world and dissolve the night .  
Addressing at the opening ceremony , Mr Donald Tsang Yam-kuen noted that although many people thought Hong Kong had a history of only a hundred years or so , archeological findings revealed that the territory had been inhabited for over 6,000 years , and that her geological age was traced back to 400 million years ago .  He said Hong Kong had indeed been built up from rich natural and cultural heritage .  
The discussion paper contains suggestions about how the appropriate size of the DIS fund might be set , how it could be built up and maintained and how premium could be assessed for individual banks ( including the possible introduction of a differential premium system based on the supervisory ratings of banks ) .  
It is a traditional three-hall two-courtyard building .  The exact year of construction of the building can not be ascertained .  According to the villagers , however , the ancestral hall was built by Tang Yuen-wang , Tang Mui-kei and Tang Nim-fung of the thirteenth generation in the Ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) to commemorate his tenth generation ancestor Tang King-law who was respected as the first generation of Lau Kwong Tong of the Tang clan in Tai Po Tau .  
Finally , the Great Wall was extended in an unbroken line for thousands of miles across territories with varied topographic and geological characteristics .  Over the two millennia , the Great Wall was mainly built by raw materials procured from local sources and adapted to local conditions to take the best of topographic advantage .  
The Hong Kong City Hall , the first multi-purpose cultural center built for the community 's enhancement of quality life , has been growing strong with the community for 40 years .  Many facilities housed in the City Hall including Low Block 's concert hall , theatre , exhibition hall ; the High Block 's public library , marriage registry , exhibition gallery , and even the memorial garden , may bring to members of the public memories that are reminiscent of the different stages of their life .  
Speaking at the reception , the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services , Mr Paul S W Leung said , " Hong Kong City Hall was the first and only multi-purpose cultural complex built in the 1960s to provide venues for performing arts as well as library and museum services to the community .  " It is a landmark which signifies the remarkable achievements and growth of local cultural and artistic creations , bringing many happy memories to the public , audience and readers . "

According to the theory , a star will evolve into a red giant when the hydrogen in the core of it is used up .  The star in this stage will blow out a stellar wind which carries away a large amount of stellar substances .  The fast stellar wind may blow at a speed of thousands of kilometers per second and will catch up the slower wind ahead and push the substance forward like a snow plow .  The accumulated gas shell thus built up is the planetary nebula .  
At the end of last month , the Rental Housing Committee of the Housing Authority ( " HA " ) fixed the per-square-metre rents for public rental housing ( " PRH " ) units to be completed in the latter half of this year at the same level as the current highest per-square-metre PRH rents in the corresponding districts and , for the rental units which were formerly built for two Home Ownership Scheme ( " HOS " ) projects , the per-square-metre rents are set at 10 per cent higher .  
Mr Tung noted that a respectable science base had been built up in Hong Kong over the past five years as a result of sustained government efforts and increased public recognition that innovation and technology held the key to the future of Hong Kong .  
We have built a local public key infrastructure supported by four recognised certification authorities in the public and private sectors , in order to provide the community with digital certificates for the conduct of secure electronic transactions .  
After more than 20 years ' development , with the provision of a total of nine hectares of land by reclamation or site formation , public facilities including a indoor sports centre , waterfront park , fire station , rural public housing estate , market complex , waterfront promenade and sewage treatment plant are built to greatly improve the quality of life of the local residents .  
* a DPS Fund - with a target fund size of 0.3% of the banking sector 's total amount of protected deposits , which is equivalent to approximately HK $ 1.6 billion at the current level of deposits - would be built up in approximately five years  
Hong Kong has always been the world 's freest economy .  It has built up sound market mechanisms and its goodwill is recognised internationally .  We have robust legal institutions , legislation to protect intellectual property , an efficient and transparent government , and a business community with a well-earned reputation for fulfilling its contractual obligations .  
Manufacturers of electric wire and cables in Taiwan have built automatic plants to produce high quality continuous copper rod . Such a plant needs capitalization of US $ 5,000,000 . This continuous rod has a number of major characteristics : It is cost-saving . Each roll weighs 5 tons . Transportation costs and the tedious work of connection can be saved or reduced .  
In 1969 , an electricity generating plant was built on the island , and in 1978 an underwater cable was completed linking the island to electricity services in Pingtung County . At present , 97 percent of homes on the island are electrified . In the past , drinking water came from underground sources which were high in nitric acid content , and in the dry season , often inadequate .  
The trolleys , carts and tools they left behind , now covered with rust and moss , have become treasured relics for today 's visitors , while the little Japanese-style cottages built for the loggers ' families , now abandoned , are favorite resting places for the weary .  
Although tall structures toppled like dominoes in the earthquake last September in Mexico City , experts still maintain that standard concrete buildings reinforced by steel girders , built along the principles of sound construction , have the best chance at surviving serious earthquakes .  
But after 30 years as an ambassador I 've come to one conclusion about international relations : exhortations to another country about shared feelings , morality , and fighting the common enemy , while not completely useless , are certainly limited in effect ; what 's needed is a relationship of shared interests built on a realistic basis .  
Halfway up the slope of a mountain on the Chiufen-Shuanghsi road rests a silent wooden workers ' hut . Chiufen resident Lin Hsin-hsiung takes us up a section of road and into the hut . This hut is built next to an unobtrusive and ordinary mine pit opening , and were it not for the gold panning paraphernalia just outside it would be hard to tell that this was indeed a gold mine .  
Within these three goals , these are our efforts in each individual area : In the area of national defense : Following the policy of military modernization , we have built up formidable armed forces , successfully developed sophisticated weaponry according to a predetermined plan , and implemented the policy of using only highly qualified soldiers ; over the past five years , military personnel have been reduced by over 35,000 persons .  
In recent years , because of the rapid increase in the airline industry and the aging of planes built in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , major aircraft manufacturers in the U . S . and Europe have , unable to meet rising demand , made the newly industrialized countries partners in cooperation .  
At the end of the Ch'ing , the port became obstructed by silt , and it lost its value as a port . The local center of activity shifted to Chunan . And when the railroad was built , it only stopped at Chunan , further isolating Chungkang .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
But if cars can pass through on a new cross-island highway , people will just drive through , passing Yuli in an instant . " It 's like when the southern cross-island highway was built , " he says . " At first everyone at the eastern starting point of Haituan was vigorously in favor of opening the road , thinking that people would be able to get to Taitung in only an hour , but since then the city has been in gradual decline . "  
The Elizabethan-style Tsubouchi Memorial Theater Museum , built in commemoration of the dramatist Shoyo Tsubouchi , is one of a kind in the entire country . Dr . Tsubouchi translated the complete works of Shakespeare into Japanese and introduced audiences to the works of Ibsen , Gorky and other European playwrights . Japan was very conservative at the time , and staging these early 20th century pieces , which were defiant of social taboos and convention , was daring and sensational .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
The museum enables employees to gain a concrete idea of just how we built up our corporate reputation and an understanding of what each department does , " explains the museum 's director , Wu Mu-hsiang . Learning about the past gives them common memories and produces a sense of cohesion , he says , citing an example . When they discovered a refrigerator made 30 years ago still being used in one family 's kitchen , their hearts lit up with pride .  
Otherwise , if one just adopts the form outright , it could turn out like the Hsiu Lang Elementary School in Yungho : The newly built four story school building is a four-sided ( fully enclosed ) ho-yuan , but because an activities center was added to the courtyard , the school thus became an enormous resonance chamber . The only thing the school could do was to restrict the children from running about , thus contradicting the original spirit of the large communal compound .  
Trying to say that a given number is either auspicious or ominous is mere superstition . Still , unlike the western sensitivity to the number 13 , Chinese have a whole philosophy built up around numbers , which is spread or experienced in real life .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
When , in 1989 , the Chinese Communists committed the horrendous atrocity of the Tienanmen massacre in full view of the world 's media , Western governments were finally roused from their dreaming . The last threads of the illusion they had built up concerning the movement of China 's communist authorities towards democracy were broken . In stark contrast , the liberalization and process of political normalization on this side of the Taiwan Strait led the West to begin to accept the ROC as a member of the democratic camp . "  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
In particular , though there are now many large corporations , many of these were built up from scratch by hard-working and frugal entrepreneurs . It would just be too painful for them to lay out the large amount of cash required to bring in an environmental engineering firm to install a full set of equipment .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
For a long time , the WCB has only built wall-type dikes which stand perpendicular to the surface . In the past the main purpose of the sea dikes was to prevent intense waves brought by bad weather from heading inland . Today the coast suffers from the effects of inland gravel extraction and ground water extraction and is continually eroding .  
A swimming pool at the beach : Six years ago Taiwan had still not lifted martial law , and strict controls over beach areas hindered the chances for intimacy between the sea and this island people . Today most of the restrictions on approaching coastal areas have been removed , but now we are cut off from the sea by dikes we have built ourselves .  
At the beach play ground at Mashakou in Tainan , a half-storey tall dike was built right on the golden beach . Those operating the recreational area figured they might as well put up a swimming pool inside the dike - - and there ended up being more people playing in the pool than on the beach .  
Measurements show that it was an irregularly shaped rectangle , about 430 meters wide east to west and 540 meters long north to south . The area of the city was about 200,000 square meters . Archaeologists have even discovered remnants of city walls built to a height of six or seven meters . This dirt wall is from 4000 years before our time .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
The banks and shoals of the Tsengwen estuary , built up by the accretion of silt over thousands of years , are rich in organic matter and bottomdwelling organisms , and the estuary 's broad intertidal zone , with large-scale aquaculture nearby , provides a safe environment with abundant food , which attracts enormous numbers of migratory birds to rest or over winter here .  
Over thirty years , I wrote five books in Chinese . Since becoming ill , in less than half a year I have written two . I have discovered that my potential can be devoted to writing . This confidence is also something that readers have built up for me .  
The path was built along the playful , light current of the crisp , green Shakatang River . The little trail runs not far above the river bed . After catching sight of such an unpolluted river , who can resist the temptation to leap into the bubbling waters and swim ?  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
What 's more , in 1993 a private financial consortium built the nearby Shin Kong Life Tower , a 53-story skyscraper that has already become a new symbol of the city . And the new 12-story KMT party headquarters is to be located by the East Gate directly across from the Presidential Palace . The Po Ai District is gradually being enclosed amid a concrete jungle of modern skyscrapers .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
They demolished the Empress of Heaven Temple ( built by the Qing court ) and other symbols of Chinese culture . They employed what they considered to be the most modern urban planning methods , imported from the West . Not even in Japan proper did they have an opportunity to implement such a comprehensive urban design .  
When the sampans brought chest after chest of tea wrapped in bamboo strips and oiled paper and lined with lead , the stevedores expertly packed them tightly into the hold , starting with the cheapest teas at the bottom . As they built up layer upon layer , they used different sized chests and stone dunnage to pack the tea chests together seamlessly , then used wooden mallets to tap the surface of each layer down as flush as a ship 's deck .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
This was the most bothersome problem for Kuo Mei-fang . " I was sure the clock tower could be made to be very precise , but only if it was built by very skilled craftsmen . This might have been possible for an ancient emperor to arrange , but for me as a lowly civil servant it was a tall order . "  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
But a month later , when the planting , harvesting and sale of quick-growing vegetables had resumed down in the plains , there were still many places on the Northern Cross-Island Highway where the road bed was continuing to collapse and the surface still being washed away , and rocks were still falling down the mountainsides . As for various farming access roads which were never graded or built on proper foundations in the first place , whenever it rains many of them simply " disappear . "  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
Premier Lien Chan however stressed that by redoubling its efforts to hamstring the ROC internationally Beijing showed scant regard for the legitimate rights of the people of the Taiwan Area , and that its actions were conducive neither to cross-strait relations nor to national reunification . Future reunification could only be built on a foundation of mutual respect , and the ROC would continue to develop its international room for maneuver .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
People are often bedazzled by the earth-shaking " sacrifices " of romantic love , but Ko believes that classical love , which " succeeds " by day-to-day effort , morning and night , is even more special . This is the deep and subtle spirit of " joy without excess . " Perhaps this is why in the West there is the saying , " marriage is the tomb of love , " whereas the Chinese , in a society built on the Confucian moral code , feel that " marriage is the beginning of love . "  
Flowers have feelings too In the Xiaozong reign ( 1163-1189 ) of the Southern Song , the literatus Zhang Gongfu not only planted an orchard full of plum trees and built his house among them , he also listed dozens of things plum flowers liked or disliked , or which they found honorable or shameful , delectable or loathsome .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
The poet Alexander Pope was an early enthusiast for the Chinese view of nature and , with the help of Burlington , built a small garden on the bank of the winding Thames river in the south London suburbs . It had no fence , parallel paths or symmetrical flower beds . He planned to make it a place where he could engage in literary and artistic pursuits .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
From the memories of old family members and from old photographs , one can reconstruct the exquisite scene of former times : at dawn the dense mist hanging over the seven pools enshrouds the surrounding paddy fields , but as the first rays of sunshine strike through , one sees the Li Family Compound , built of bricks and stone , standing sturdy among the expanse of green . This is why the local nickname for this great house was " Beauty in the Fields . "  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
The Japanese were the first to lay roads into the region in order to crush anti-Japanese resistance on Mt . Tsao . Stumbling upon the volcanic topography , they built the hot spring baths for which the whole area from Mt . Tsao to Peitou would become famous . From 1924 , the Japanese began an effort to " create a forest on Mt . Tatun . " They also encouraged local farmers to set up nurseries , which are the forerunners of the flower farms visited by tourists today .  
For example , traditionally most museums have had permanent collections built around a specific theme . But very often their artifacts are far removed from their places of origin , cutting off their connection to their original environment , thereby obscuring much of their contextual meaning .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
In Chung 's paintings of broken down old homes , one also sees the different materials used in the three levels of the walls : the lowest section is made of stone ; the middle section is constructed out of brick or faced with earthenware tiles ; and the topmost section is built from mud bricks covered in plaster .  
The Lin family 's " New Tile House " was built almost two centuries ago , and is the oldest family compound in the Liuchia high-speed rail development area . The high-speed rail plan originally called for the ancestral shrine and some of the defensive walls to be preserved as a park , but local residents and the Lin family are not satisfied with this solution and have been protesting to the agency in charge of the high-speed rail in the hope of persuading it to preserve the entire compound .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island . The company was given a wide range of tasks , and construction of buildings urgently needed by the occupying forces received top priority . Facilities built included administrative quarters , a mess hall , barracks , and a naval comfort station .  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
In the 1960s , encouraged by a government-sponsored campaign for a renaissance of Chinese culture , many official buildings were built in a style reminiscent of the ornate , solemn palace architecture of northern China , and for occasions such as National Day , Taiwan Retrocession Day and Constitution Day , Chinese-style ceremonial arches would be put up over the entrances to government agencies and across major roads .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased . This was a space built by the Chinese gold workers and business people of those bygone days as their resting place for the afterlife . It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Years ago , the Japanese built the Mienyueh branch of the Alishan Mountain Railway to gain access to the cypress forests for logging . As the engineers cut their way along mountainsides and hacked out tunnels , they exposed large areas of steep rock face shaded by dense jungle above , and thus unwittingly produced excellent conditions for pleiones to grow .  
Fully grown maroon orioles are fierce birds with few natural enemies , and they generally feed in mixed flocks with other bird species . But in the breeding season their chicks are much coveted by snakes , squirrels , crows and sparrowhawks , and an attack will often prompt the sensitive parent birds to abandon the nest they have built .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Red team scholars typically argue that the US and PRC share many long-term interests in common and that a cooperative relationship can be built and maintained . The Clinton administration 's policy of an " active strategic partnership " was based on suggestions made by so-called red team scholars .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
As visitors hurry by on their way from one scenic spot to the next , on the steep slopes they see the patches of Japanese knotweed , stonecrop and spiraea , with little flowers blossoming shyly in all shades of yellow and red ; the dense , short arrow bamboo ; and the Yushan roses heavy with rose hips . But only Lo Liu-chih knows that at little more than arm 's length , the tangled vegetation hides many nests laboriously built by a bird found only in Taiwan .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
Revenues from kaoliang have always been critical to Kinmen 's economy , and , to meet market demand , in 1997 a second plant was built at the Kinmen distillery . Current products include premium kaoliang ( commonly called baijinlong ) , aged kaoliang , low-alcohol kaoliang , damian liquor , and various medicinal and commemorative brews . All are highly competitive in the marketplace .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
Of the finger bones , only one is still in existence today . To ensure safe passage to Taiwan , a miniature pagoda ( encrusted with pearls , agate , coral , amber , sapphire , emeralds , and colored glass ) was built to house and protect it .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
Known as " a prime example of the Taiwan railroad bridge , " it combined brick arch design with widely spaced steel beams . The bridge was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1935 , and a new bypass was built , so that the remains of the fractured span , now known as the Lungteng broken bridge , still stand unrepaired .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
It occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters , and cost NT $ 380 million to build . The idea for its design came from the historical vicissitudes of the archeological discoveries , and from the first peoples who crossed the sea in boats to come to Taiwan . The museum is built in three disparate architectural styles , representing the connection between mountains and sea , between past and present . The arched steel-framed structure symbolizes the sea , with the structural layout employing outward radiating lines to indicate the ocean .  
During the era of Japanese rule , the colonial rulers pursued a policy of Japanizing Taiwan . They destroyed Chinese Taoist temples and built Shinto shrines , and they strictly prohibited the use of traditional Chinese ceremonial objects , such as incense burner tripods and orange-shaped lanterns used in traditional worship . Families put these under tables or in storage , where they rusted or tarnished .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
Attentive visitors can also learn some of the many stories the guesthouses have to tell . For example , the exceptionally stylish Garden of Rushes has a beautiful garden , an elegantly decorated interior , and a marvelously graceful innkeeper who looks as if she had just stepped out of one of Chiung Yao 's romances . But the kicker is that the garden , which features a small bridge over running water , was designed and built by the innkeeper and her husband in their spare time .  
The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
There 's an interesting story connected with the Taiwan Shinto Shrine . It was built from imported stone and cypress logged on Mt . Ali in central Taiwan . When colonial rule came to an end following Japan 's defeat in World War II , new rulers came in from China and the shrine was slated for dismantling . For the mere cost of the transport , painter Li Mei-shu had the priceless building materials carted off to Sanhsia south of Taipei , where he used them to renovate the Tsu Shih Temple .  
Buildings were built out over the sidewalks , buttressed by square beams or curved arches , with businesses downstairs and residences upstairs . This is the most characteristic architectural form shared by all of Taiwan 's cities and towns , north and south .  
" In the last few years , the government has come out with a number of preferential tax policies , with bizarre results , " says Steve Tsui . " Even in years when the rate of economic growth has been decent , tax revenues have continued to fall . " Under these circumstances , economic growth alone can not rescue government finances . The tricky part is going to be dealing with the internal structural factors built into the tax system .  
However , Choice 's main task is the construction of book and magazine centers nationwide ; vital logistical centers like those of Hunan Publishing House and the Beijing Institute of Light Industry are entirely built on the work of Choice , from hardware construction to software and human resource management , all on a solid base of Taiwanese know-how .  
Currently other localities are lining up to threaten the use of referendums to give expression to local aspirations . For example , Hsihu Township in Miaoli County is seeking to have a Hsihu exit built on the Central Second Freeway , Wulai Rural Township in Taipei County is demanding that the government abolish the toll booths that collect environmental maintenance fees in the Wulai Scenic Area , Penghu County is demanding the opening of tourist casinos , etc . In no time at all the referendum seems to have become the convenient new favorite for solving deadlocked disputes .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
" It 's like a chicken digging for bugs to eat-if there are no bugs in this spot , he 'll head off somewhere else . " Because they did n't want to be sponsored , and thus be constrained by businesspeople , they decided to set up for themselves . They found Sanhsing , where the land was cheap and the area secluded and conducive to creativity , and built a small , beautiful museum , starting along the path to self-sufficient artistry .  
As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake . The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .  
Of the 34 lighthouses Taiwan has built on its coasts and nearby islands , Huang Ching-jung has been a keeper for 27 , more than any other person in the country . Forty-five of the 75 years of his life have been spent among the lighthouses . Although he has been retired for ten years , Huang has still not lost his feeling for the lighthouses . He uses discarded pipes to make models of the lighthouses that he puts in his home , and in many dreams late at night he is still connected to the lighthouses .  
Michelle Sung Ing / tr . by Michael Hill Lighthouses are built to guide ships at sea , and many are built on barren , uninhabited islands that are normally hardly visited at all , other than by a few fishermen who come during the fishing season . Lighthouse keepers rely completely on periodic deliveries of food , water , and daily necessities from supply boats , and thus all lighthouse keepers are trained to be versatile , and must take care of all housing maintenance , including electrical work , metal work , woodworking , and painting .  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .  
" To get that outside money , they accommodated more and more tourists , ripping up the mountains to lay large parking lots , trails and pavilions , " says Lai Peng-chih , who previously served as secretary-general of the Taiwan Ecotourism Association . " They replaced their original structures built out of natural materials with concrete buildings . " This development had a major impact on the environment , Lai says , disturbing the growth of plants and animals .  
It was only then that I learned hot showers are regarded as an extravagance . On the very highest point of the north peak , the weather station is almost entirely dependent on rain and snowfall for its water . When the Japanese first built the station in 1943 they constructed a water storage tank in the basement , designed to hold ten tons of water . Unfortunately , the tank is now old and cracked , and leaks so badly it can only hold two or three tons at a time .  
For the children 's forest playground , Chang designed the observation deck , determined the angle at which to set the slide , and calculated how much wood would be needed for the project . Using timber from the coconut palms , the most abundant local source of wood , the villagers built the entire playground themselves .  
The Pan Kung gate is the outermost gate of the temple , but during their occupation of Taiwan the Japanese split the gate from the rest of the temple structure when they built Nanmen Road between them . Since the gate was split from the temple proper , its real purpose has gradually faded from collective memory , so it 's not surprising so few people realize it 's actually part of the temple .  
A six-storied building located on Waxili Baowen Blvd . was built in 1930 and suffered partial structural damage in the 1977 earthquake .  However , the unique architectural style of this building has maintained its peculiar charm and never failed to draw the admiration of passers-by .  
" Hong Kong now enjoys social stability , and the situation is encouraging , " the spokesman said , noting that over the past century the people of Hong Kong have built their home with hard work and wisdom , which is typical of the Chinese nation as a whole , into an important international trade , financial and shipping center  
" In a full changing world where big political and economic groupings are being built and consolidated , Africa will still be marginalized if she does not constitute a united , solid and strong bloc to make herself better understood and demonstrate her capacity as an actor to reckon with on the international scene , " he said  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
It stated that a people 's democracy would be built in the political , social , economic and cultural spheres that took account of traditional structures and aimed at a subsequent transition to socialism .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .  
Indeed , the Fourth World Conference on Women , which ended only last month in Beijing , has given impetus to the need for programmes that speak to the issues of women in development and , most critically , the empowerment of women in local communities , enabling their full participation at all levels in the process of national development .  Grenada is encouraged by the new spirit of international cooperation built on a shared partnership between multilateral financial institutions and Governments .  
Our economy , although subject to the blockade , will grow and will provide for and meet the most pressing needs of our people .  The powerful infrastructure that we have built up over three decades with what some have called the subsidy that Cuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level of education and culture and a stable land of peace and order .  
As part of its primary responsibility for public information activities built around the World Public Information Campaign for Human Rights and the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in 1993 , the Department reprinted and distributed essential publications on human rights , including backgrounders on human rights and culture and on indigenous people .  
Executive Board decision 94 / 14 synthesized and built on a decade of gradual reform , 1 / providing UNDP with the three principal goals of ( a ) strengthening international cooperation for sustainable human development ; ( b ) helping the United Nations family to become a unified and powerful force for human development ; and ( c ) focusing UNDP resources on making the maximum contribution in its programme countries to key SHD dimensions .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
In addition to selecting schools to be upgraded or built , the issue of equity between regions and genders should be assessed , with studies on selected policy matters , such as reducing imbalances for disadvantaged groups and increasing internal efficiency , in order to enable policy makers to make decisions based on in-depth analyses of local conditions and on comparative analysis of countries facing similar problems .  
The Plan focuses on stimulating and supporting national and local activities and initiatives and is built upon the idea of a partnership between Governments , international organizations , NGOs , professional associations , individuals and large segments of civil society .  
Recognizing that the prevailing complex emergency in Afghanistan has already lasted more than 15 years and that many aspects of national government are still dysfunctional , the United Nations family has devoted considerable attention to ensuring that , wherever possible , the longer-term objective of sustainability is built into all programmes .  
Social services have an essential role to play in preventing the abandonment of rural areas and in seeing to it that services are available where people live and during the accelerated development of large urban areas ; they must ensure the functioning of infrastructure , such as roads and hospitals , built at high cost but threatened with collapse by a lack of will and of personnel able to maintain and manage them .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
It is incomprehensible that while Argentina and the United Kingdom have overcome the sorrow and have left behind their mutual disagreements and distrust and built up a harmonious and constructive relationship and we see the positive results of this day by day they have not so far been able to comply with the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Decolonization Committee and to progress in the dialogue towards a definitive solution to this dispute .  
Towards this end the New Agenda , which built on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development ( 1986-1990 ) , set out in definitive terms a global compact of intent between Africa and the United Nations system on the one hand and between Africa and the international community on the other .  
We are confident that the same initiative , determination and courage that the parties demonstrated in forging a historical framework for the peace and stability of the region can likewise be invoked to pave a new avenue built upon cooperation and coexistence that will eventually lead to a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) .  
Peace is built through ordinary coexistence , with all Guatemalans , male or female , striving daily to make a living and to help their families get ahead , seeking out better opportunities while enduring hardships in a country with so many limitations and so much distrust . 
There is a sense of great opportunity and hope that a new world can be built in which economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development can be realized through solidarity and cooperation within and between countries , and through effective partnerships at all levels .  
Whether its mandate is still required gives rise to the question posed in paragraph 25 of my report of 30 January 1996 ( S / 1996 / 65 ) : how does one measure the success of a preventive operation and judge that if it is reduced or withdrawn peace and stability will continue to hold , threats and tensions that have so far been contained will disappear and channels or institutions for defusing them will continue to be built or consolidated ? 
Recent United Nations world conferences , including , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , have given us a comprehensive agenda for the equitable attainment of peace , justice and democracy built on economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The Ministers reiterated their call to the Iranian Government to end its occupation of the islands , to desist from pursuing a policy of imposing faits accomplis by force , to halt the adoption of unilateral measures , to remove the effects of any unilateral measures taken or any installations built , to adopt peaceful means of resolving the ongoing dispute in accordance with the principles and norms of international law , and to agree to the referral of the issue to the International Court of Justice .  
While urging the United Nations to take the necessary steps to halt the irresponsible actions of the United States Administration , which can only reduce the Organization 's role to insignificance and destroy the peaceful basis on which international relations are built , the Government of the Republic of Iraq holds the United States Government fully accountable before international law for any consequences its aggressive and unlawful positions vis - - vis Iraq may have . 
The Plan focuses on stimulating and supporting national and local activities and initiatives and is built upon the idea of a partnership between Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations , professional associations , individuals and wide sectors of civil society .

Measurements show that it was an irregularly shaped rectangle , about 430 meters wide east to west and 540 meters long north to south . The area of the city was about 200,000 square meters . Archaeologists have even discovered remnants of city walls built to a height of six or seven meters . This dirt wall is from 4000 years before our time .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
The banks and shoals of the Tsengwen estuary , built up by the accretion of silt over thousands of years , are rich in organic matter and bottomdwelling organisms , and the estuary 's broad intertidal zone , with large-scale aquaculture nearby , provides a safe environment with abundant food , which attracts enormous numbers of migratory birds to rest or over winter here .  
Over thirty years , I wrote five books in Chinese . Since becoming ill , in less than half a year I have written two . I have discovered that my potential can be devoted to writing . This confidence is also something that readers have built up for me .  
The path was built along the playful , light current of the crisp , green Shakatang River . The little trail runs not far above the river bed . After catching sight of such an unpolluted river , who can resist the temptation to leap into the bubbling waters and swim ?  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
What 's more , in 1993 a private financial consortium built the nearby Shin Kong Life Tower , a 53-story skyscraper that has already become a new symbol of the city . And the new 12-story KMT party headquarters is to be located by the East Gate directly across from the Presidential Palace . The Po Ai District is gradually being enclosed amid a concrete jungle of modern skyscrapers .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
They demolished the Empress of Heaven Temple ( built by the Qing court ) and other symbols of Chinese culture . They employed what they considered to be the most modern urban planning methods , imported from the West . Not even in Japan proper did they have an opportunity to implement such a comprehensive urban design .  
When the sampans brought chest after chest of tea wrapped in bamboo strips and oiled paper and lined with lead , the stevedores expertly packed them tightly into the hold , starting with the cheapest teas at the bottom . As they built up layer upon layer , they used different sized chests and stone dunnage to pack the tea chests together seamlessly , then used wooden mallets to tap the surface of each layer down as flush as a ship 's deck .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
This was the most bothersome problem for Kuo Mei-fang . " I was sure the clock tower could be made to be very precise , but only if it was built by very skilled craftsmen . This might have been possible for an ancient emperor to arrange , but for me as a lowly civil servant it was a tall order . "  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
But a month later , when the planting , harvesting and sale of quick-growing vegetables had resumed down in the plains , there were still many places on the Northern Cross-Island Highway where the road bed was continuing to collapse and the surface still being washed away , and rocks were still falling down the mountainsides . As for various farming access roads which were never graded or built on proper foundations in the first place , whenever it rains many of them simply " disappear . "  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
Premier Lien Chan however stressed that by redoubling its efforts to hamstring the ROC internationally Beijing showed scant regard for the legitimate rights of the people of the Taiwan Area , and that its actions were conducive neither to cross-strait relations nor to national reunification . Future reunification could only be built on a foundation of mutual respect , and the ROC would continue to develop its international room for maneuver .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
People are often bedazzled by the earth-shaking " sacrifices " of romantic love , but Ko believes that classical love , which " succeeds " by day-to-day effort , morning and night , is even more special . This is the deep and subtle spirit of " joy without excess . " Perhaps this is why in the West there is the saying , " marriage is the tomb of love , " whereas the Chinese , in a society built on the Confucian moral code , feel that " marriage is the beginning of love . "  
Flowers have feelings too In the Xiaozong reign ( 1163-1189 ) of the Southern Song , the literatus Zhang Gongfu not only planted an orchard full of plum trees and built his house among them , he also listed dozens of things plum flowers liked or disliked , or which they found honorable or shameful , delectable or loathsome .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
The poet Alexander Pope was an early enthusiast for the Chinese view of nature and , with the help of Burlington , built a small garden on the bank of the winding Thames river in the south London suburbs . It had no fence , parallel paths or symmetrical flower beds . He planned to make it a place where he could engage in literary and artistic pursuits .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
Though the emperor could have a water clock built for himself , for ordinary people in traditional China there were no convenient clocks . Most folks used a sundial to determine the time of day . This was all pretty unimportant for the day 's work , which began when the sun rose and ended when the sun set .  
From the memories of old family members and from old photographs , one can reconstruct the exquisite scene of former times : at dawn the dense mist hanging over the seven pools enshrouds the surrounding paddy fields , but as the first rays of sunshine strike through , one sees the Li Family Compound , built of bricks and stone , standing sturdy among the expanse of green . This is why the local nickname for this great house was " Beauty in the Fields . "  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
The Japanese were the first to lay roads into the region in order to crush anti-Japanese resistance on Mt . Tsao . Stumbling upon the volcanic topography , they built the hot spring baths for which the whole area from Mt . Tsao to Peitou would become famous . From 1924 , the Japanese began an effort to " create a forest on Mt . Tatun . " They also encouraged local farmers to set up nurseries , which are the forerunners of the flower farms visited by tourists today .  
For example , traditionally most museums have had permanent collections built around a specific theme . But very often their artifacts are far removed from their places of origin , cutting off their connection to their original environment , thereby obscuring much of their contextual meaning .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
" This is something that both sexes want , " avers Wang Hao-wei , psychiatrist and author of the book Taiwan Men . Women , he notes , are experiencing rising self-consciousness , and want equal status and a fairer division of labor . Men , meanwhile , are hoping to escape rigid traditional roles and to have the chance to be more relaxed , more free to express their true selves . Men and women together have built up and share a common image of a new man .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
In Chung 's paintings of broken down old homes , one also sees the different materials used in the three levels of the walls : the lowest section is made of stone ; the middle section is constructed out of brick or faced with earthenware tiles ; and the topmost section is built from mud bricks covered in plaster .  
The Lin family 's " New Tile House " was built almost two centuries ago , and is the oldest family compound in the Liuchia high-speed rail development area . The high-speed rail plan originally called for the ancestral shrine and some of the defensive walls to be preserved as a park , but local residents and the Lin family are not satisfied with this solution and have been protesting to the agency in charge of the high-speed rail in the hope of persuading it to preserve the entire compound .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island . The company was given a wide range of tasks , and construction of buildings urgently needed by the occupying forces received top priority . Facilities built included administrative quarters , a mess hall , barracks , and a naval comfort station .  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
In the 1960s , encouraged by a government-sponsored campaign for a renaissance of Chinese culture , many official buildings were built in a style reminiscent of the ornate , solemn palace architecture of northern China , and for occasions such as National Day , Taiwan Retrocession Day and Constitution Day , Chinese-style ceremonial arches would be put up over the entrances to government agencies and across major roads .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased . This was a space built by the Chinese gold workers and business people of those bygone days as their resting place for the afterlife . It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Years ago , the Japanese built the Mienyueh branch of the Alishan Mountain Railway to gain access to the cypress forests for logging . As the engineers cut their way along mountainsides and hacked out tunnels , they exposed large areas of steep rock face shaded by dense jungle above , and thus unwittingly produced excellent conditions for pleiones to grow .  
Fully grown maroon orioles are fierce birds with few natural enemies , and they generally feed in mixed flocks with other bird species . But in the breeding season their chicks are much coveted by snakes , squirrels , crows and sparrowhawks , and an attack will often prompt the sensitive parent birds to abandon the nest they have built .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Red team scholars typically argue that the US and PRC share many long-term interests in common and that a cooperative relationship can be built and maintained . The Clinton administration 's policy of an " active strategic partnership " was based on suggestions made by so-called red team scholars .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
As visitors hurry by on their way from one scenic spot to the next , on the steep slopes they see the patches of Japanese knotweed , stonecrop and spiraea , with little flowers blossoming shyly in all shades of yellow and red ; the dense , short arrow bamboo ; and the Yushan roses heavy with rose hips . But only Lo Liu-chih knows that at little more than arm 's length , the tangled vegetation hides many nests laboriously built by a bird found only in Taiwan .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
Revenues from kaoliang have always been critical to Kinmen 's economy , and , to meet market demand , in 1997 a second plant was built at the Kinmen distillery . Current products include premium kaoliang ( commonly called baijinlong ) , aged kaoliang , low-alcohol kaoliang , damian liquor , and various medicinal and commemorative brews . All are highly competitive in the marketplace .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
Of the finger bones , only one is still in existence today . To ensure safe passage to Taiwan , a miniature pagoda ( encrusted with pearls , agate , coral , amber , sapphire , emeralds , and colored glass ) was built to house and protect it .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
Known as " a prime example of the Taiwan railroad bridge , " it combined brick arch design with widely spaced steel beams . The bridge was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1935 , and a new bypass was built , so that the remains of the fractured span , now known as the Lungteng broken bridge , still stand unrepaired .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
It occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters , and cost NT $ 380 million to build . The idea for its design came from the historical vicissitudes of the archeological discoveries , and from the first peoples who crossed the sea in boats to come to Taiwan . The museum is built in three disparate architectural styles , representing the connection between mountains and sea , between past and present . The arched steel-framed structure symbolizes the sea , with the structural layout employing outward radiating lines to indicate the ocean .  
During the era of Japanese rule , the colonial rulers pursued a policy of Japanizing Taiwan . They destroyed Chinese Taoist temples and built Shinto shrines , and they strictly prohibited the use of traditional Chinese ceremonial objects , such as incense burner tripods and orange-shaped lanterns used in traditional worship . Families put these under tables or in storage , where they rusted or tarnished .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
Attentive visitors can also learn some of the many stories the guesthouses have to tell . For example , the exceptionally stylish Garden of Rushes has a beautiful garden , an elegantly decorated interior , and a marvelously graceful innkeeper who looks as if she had just stepped out of one of Chiung Yao 's romances . But the kicker is that the garden , which features a small bridge over running water , was designed and built by the innkeeper and her husband in their spare time .  
The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
There 's an interesting story connected with the Taiwan Shinto Shrine . It was built from imported stone and cypress logged on Mt . Ali in central Taiwan . When colonial rule came to an end following Japan 's defeat in World War II , new rulers came in from China and the shrine was slated for dismantling . For the mere cost of the transport , painter Li Mei-shu had the priceless building materials carted off to Sanhsia south of Taipei , where he used them to renovate the Tsu Shih Temple .  
Buildings were built out over the sidewalks , buttressed by square beams or curved arches , with businesses downstairs and residences upstairs . This is the most characteristic architectural form shared by all of Taiwan 's cities and towns , north and south .  
" In the last few years , the government has come out with a number of preferential tax policies , with bizarre results , " says Steve Tsui . " Even in years when the rate of economic growth has been decent , tax revenues have continued to fall . " Under these circumstances , economic growth alone can not rescue government finances . The tricky part is going to be dealing with the internal structural factors built into the tax system .  
However , Choice 's main task is the construction of book and magazine centers nationwide ; vital logistical centers like those of Hunan Publishing House and the Beijing Institute of Light Industry are entirely built on the work of Choice , from hardware construction to software and human resource management , all on a solid base of Taiwanese know-how .  
Currently other localities are lining up to threaten the use of referendums to give expression to local aspirations . For example , Hsihu Township in Miaoli County is seeking to have a Hsihu exit built on the Central Second Freeway , Wulai Rural Township in Taipei County is demanding that the government abolish the toll booths that collect environmental maintenance fees in the Wulai Scenic Area , Penghu County is demanding the opening of tourist casinos , etc .

As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake .

Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .

" This development had a major impact on the environment , Lai says , disturbing the growth of plants and animals .  
It was only then that I learned hot showers are regarded as an extravagance . On the very highest point of the north peak , the weather station is almost entirely dependent on rain and snowfall for its water .
