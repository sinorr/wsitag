The rate of decline of the price level , which has been in negative growth for more than 20 successive months , has gradually lessened as domestic demand is stimulated , and the categories of commodities whose prices are rising is now increasing .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .  
The glorious achievements we have made and the tortuous road we have gone through have proven , from positive and negative sides , that our use of scientific theory as guidance , our use of subjective reality as basis , and the continuous elevation of the Party 's level in policy theories and its ability to master the whole , are very important for the rise and fall of our cause .  
And it is being unfolded at a time when various contradictions in reforms and construction are interwoven ; a structure , mechanism , legal system , and management system that meet the demands of the development of socialist market economy await gradual establishment and perfection ; and numerous negative corruption phenomena are prone to occur .  
Both positive and negative experiences show : Under the same material and technological conditions , whether there is a mental force and whether the mental force is strong or weak will have a major bearing on success or failure of a person or a unit 's work .  The impact of this factor must never be underestimated .  
While urging the international community to exchange experiences , both positive and negative , in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , sincere cooperation , and mutual respects , China opposes the practice of exercising armed intervention against other countries by using the nationality issue as a pretext and relying on military superiority and also resolutely opposes the act of carrying out separatist activities under the pretense of safeguarding the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups . 
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
Not only the decadent capitalist ideas and style of life of the West are corroding us at every moment ; the influence of feudal ideas and other ideas of exploiting class remains as well .  In addition , the loopholes and weak links emerging in the course of economic restructuring have provided soil and conditions for the spreading of negative and corrupt phenomena .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
The circular puts forward the necessity of studying the documents in light of cases occurred in respective units , and draw inferences about other cases from one instance so that party members and cadres can really be shocked and awakened , understand better the party and administrative discipline by means of negative examples , and strengthen their sense of observing law and discipline .  
Second , major contradictions that can disrupt international security tend to become more strained .  For example , the contradiction between uni-polarization and multi-polarization , the contradiction between advanced countries and developing countries , and the contradictions between different nationalities and religions have all aggravated to different extents under the negative influence of economic globalization and as a result of the new interventionism practiced by the United States .  
The reason is that if a military attack fails to produce the desired result , especially if casualties of US troops are incurred , it will have a big negative effect on Vice President Al Gore 's quest for the presidency .  On the other hand , the American public has accepted Saddam as the " tyrant " who must be severely punished .  If no action is taken , the Clinton administration will appear weak , which is also not conducive to the creation of an image of authority for Gore .  
It is a pity that the differences in history , culture and social systems , and the discrepancy in economic development level and values have influenced the Americans in their understanding of China . The US media have the habit of exposing the negative aspects of China , not reporting or reporting less on the positive ones , because the United States still has the arrogant complex of being a big country .  
The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
After the Criminal Procedural Law was amended in 1996 , administrative detention was rescinded .  As this prevents prolonged detention in some cases , the improper adoption of coercive measures has been reduced , and people 's civil rights have been better protected .  At the same time , this does not produce any negative impact on the effectiveness of cracking down on crimes . "  
Perhaps , Li Hongzhi and his people think that inciting some addicts into causing troubles can win merits from the foreign boss and allow " Falungong " to linger out a feeble existence .  However , the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square exactly further exposed Li Hongzhi 's scheme .  The horrifying looking burnt addicts , as images of teachers by negative example , tell people that " Falungong " is a cult and tolerance toward the cult means cruelty to the innocent lives .  
They are used to social entertainment , talking in a flamboyant manner and even employ trickery and conceal the true state of affairs from their supervisors and subordinates .  These negative working styles have damaged the Party 's image , contaminated Party conduct and hurt the enthusiasm of the masses .  This has been extremely harmful to the Party 's causes .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
But since reform and opening up , under the influence of negative social effects and with the intrusive corrosion of overseas criminal syndicates , some criminal groups engaging in various serious felonious activities are gradually appearing in our country .  Their activities are becoming more and more rampant and the scales bigger and bigger .  Some have developed into criminal organizations with the character of a criminal syndicate .  
Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
Moreover , it is necessary to use the positive and negative examples to conduct vivid and lively education on legal system in light of the realities of the economic and social life so that the vast number of people will know how to safeguard their legitimate interests and rights with the law and dare to wage the struggle against all sorts of conducts in violation of law .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .

We should , in accordance with the characteristics of this educational campaign , satisfactorily conduct programs to study , supervise and discuss crucial and specific issues and topics , understand Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " in association with the Marxist theory on Party-building , consider this thinking in accordance with the positive and negative experiences of the CPC and parties of foreign countries , and study this thinking in association with replying and solving the significant theoretical and practical issues we are facing at present .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " was aimed at effectively , completely and accurately practicing Deng Xiaoping Theory so that all issues in every sector and every corner of the society we live in are healthy and advanced , so that all negative , corrupt and evil issues will be minimized , and so that the overwhelming majority of the masses can genuinely feel that , throughout the vast territory of China , the Communist Party is good indeed !  
Particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has reviewed positive and negative experiences in socialist construction , successfully created a way of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and enabled scientific socialism to be energetic , vigorous and creative in this vast land .  
Under the leadership of the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core , our party emancipated its mind and sought truth from facts ; shifted the work focus of both the party and the state towards the building of modernizations that centered around the country 's economic construction ; gradually gave form to a basic line that guided the country 's work at the initial stage of socialism upon its in-depth summarization of both positive and negative experiences gained from socialist construction ;  
Our source disclosed that in 1993 , tapes on the execution of prisoners taken from court archives were sold to foreigners by two public security and court officials at the price of scores of ten-thousand yuan .  The tapes were " edited " and combined with documentary tapes on kidney transplants at hospitals and then handed over to the western media for repeated airing just before the International Olympic Committee was about to cast its vote .  The negative impact was so great that it cost China its bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .  
Fourth , further enhance the quality of the enterprise leading bodies and promote the building of healthy party style and clean administration conduct , set strict requirements , give strict education , conduct strict management and supervision , strengthen the building of thinking style , study style , work style , leadership style , and lifestyle of the leading cadres , resolutely overcome negative and corrupt phenomena , exercise self-discipline and keep themselves upright and incorrupt , and win trust from the masses .  
At present , they are worried about how to stop losing more seats , and helplessly waiting for another splitting of the party .  These are totally passive and negative defensive thinking and tactics that have been carried out because there are no other choices , and this is a posture that is bound to lose .  
If the export growth rate for the second half of the year continues at the low level we saw in May - - or even lower , perhaps becoming negative growth - - industrial growth for the entire year will be hard pressed to reach 10% , while the GDP growth rate for the entire year may fall below the minimum target of 7% .  
Not only behavior criteria and ethical standards for leading cadres need to be adapted to socialist market economic rules and in line with the requirements of the times and with innovative spirit , they must also adhere to socialist value concept , avoid the negative impact of the market economy , and resist against such decadent thinking as mammonism , hedonism , and extreme individualism .  
The negative impact of economic globalization has not only caused unhappiness in poor countries but has also aroused strong opposition among various social strata such as environmentalists and trade union organizations in the developed countries , with the result that demonstrations against international meetings dominated by the developed western countries have continually escalated in recent years .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
Taiwan 's economic growth rate for the second quarter of 2001 was minus 2.35 percent , Taiwan 's economic growth rate for 2001 will be a negative figure for the first time , and Taiwan people have been complaining everywhere .  It fully showed : Taiwan authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has been extremely unpopular and come to a dead end .  If they still refuse to loosen their restrictions and facilitate the three cross-strait direct links as soon as possible , Taiwan 's economy will face an even greater disaster .

Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
One important reason , Jiang Zemin emphasized at the fourth plenary meeting of the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission in January of this year , for the failure to prevent some negative and corrupt phenomena , increasingly serious in some cases , in the party despite repeated interdiction efforts has been the failure on the part of CPC organizations and leaders of some localities and units to strictly administer the party in the form of failing to strictly educate , manage , and supervise CPC-member cadres , especially leading cadres .  
As the economy has been consistently mired in recessionary crises since the start of the transition , structural adjustment has been implemented not through manipulating differences in growth rate of different economic sectors , but through manipulating differences in the rate of decline of the sectors , resulting in the prominent negative and passive characters of the structural adjustment .

Without PNTR , China eventually will still join the WTO , but if following China 's WTO entry , such factors of disharmony still exist in Sino-US relations , China 's development after WTO entry will be subject to the negative impact of conservative forces coming from within the United States and from Congress , which is unfavorable to China in its bid to make better use of the opportunity of WTO entry to do such things as investing , developing foreign economic and trade connections , and system reform .

The strategic partnership established between China and the United States in the 1980 ' s has long since ceased to exist .  The 1989 Tiananmen incident and the US media 's consistently negative reports on China have made the US people even more hostile to the CPC-led government .  This has left an irreparable crack in Sino-US relations to a great extent , and created the soil and environment for the consistently anti-China rightwing conservative forces of the United States to attack and block China .  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
The development of the NMD and the TMD is bound to undermine global strategic balance , lead to a new round of arms race , and produce broad , far-reaching negative impact on international peace and security , on the process of international arms control and disarmament , and on the international non-proliferation efforts .  Such developments are compromising the regional confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the regional security .  
Many in the political circles , public opinion , and even the " vice president " Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] , all hold a reserved attitude toward Chen Shui-bian 's trip .

As well , they think it is bound to have a negative impact on the already turbid cross-strait relations .

As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
To stay outside the patterns of adult life and just hang out means to waste the most precious period of life of learning skills and knowledge . Also , given the disapproving attitude of others , it will be hard to avoid a decline in self-respect and self - esteem , which will have a negative influence on long-term prospects . At the same time , it is also a great waste of educational resources , social re sources and economic development .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
He viewed his patient 's emotional and physical state sparked by painful past experiences as a kind of " unusual mental power . " Wang is the first to employ the powers of mental projection , determination and imagination as used by Eastern religious devotees to deal with these " negative energies . "  
Because the open style of our questions elicited a wide variety of opinions , expressed in an even greater variety of ways , for ease of statistical presentation we have combined the answers into various broad categories such as positive , negative or neutral , while reflecting the more detailed content in narrative form .  
Analyzing the replies more closely , we discovered that the positive opinions were mainly centered on such aspects as Japan 's good infrastructure and its people 's unity , law-abiding nature and efficiency , while negative opinions were mainly to do with the Japanese being aggressive , cruel , treacherous and materialistic .  
Analyzing the content of the replies , in fact the positive and negative replies do not contradict each other . In other words , almost all our interviewees acknowledged that the Japanese army was both " brave and loyal " ( towards Japan ) and " cruel and ruthless " ( towards the countries they invaded ) . The only difference was in whether they personally tended to like the Japanese for this , or despise them .  
But unlike assessments of the Japanese , where people agreed on what that nation 's traits were but differed in which they chose to highlight , opinions of China 's performance were directly at odds with respect to the same criteria . For instance , those who gave good marks described China 's wartime performance as brave , indomitable , sincere and united , whereas those who gave a negative assessment thought the Chinese showed themselves to be cowardly , incompetent and divided .  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .  
Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
" For fear of children getting ill , one ca n't simply deny the existence of germs , " says Wu Wu-tien . In his view , only by " immunizing " children-presenting them with a realistic view with both positive and negative examples , and so training their capacity for moral discernment and judgement-can one give them a mental rock to hold fast to when faced with all kinds of temptations , so that they are not easily led astray .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Says Lin Yi-min , secretary general of the Career Foundation : " People still look at things like safe sex , mature reflection on relations with the opposite sex , and not creating a burden for society as the key to ' whether it 's okay ' to have sex . " When young people still struggling to get a grip on the issue of sex run into problems , people immediately question whether they 're " ready for sex , " and worried adults almost always conclude in the negative .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
Moreover , various specialized medical centers that formerly carried the ball for epidemic illnesses-such as the hospitals dedicated to tuberculosis , leprosy , and even sexually transmitted diseases-have been compelled by market forces to close or restructure . Though the general hospitals that have replaced them have state-of-the-art facilities , they do not have an adequate number of negative pressure isolation rooms with independent climate control .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth . The teaching hospitals then inspected 69 regional hospitals , which , in turn , inspected 400 local hospitals . In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
An aging population , a decreasing birthrate and a consequent increase in the social welfare burden-people have long been tired of hearing such negative news but many neither want nor dare to think about how this unavoidable trend will affect our future .  
These may be times of vertiginous political and technological change , but we sometimes feel discouraged at the persistence of tenacious negative aspects of the human condition rooted in selfishness and in the darkest chapters of our history .  
Religious and tribal fanaticism , national psyches scarred by past traumas , totalitarian regimes , selfish interests , and more all these may play a negative part in determining the future of human society in the next century .  
Notwithstanding , real GDP registered a negative growth rate of minus 2.8 per cent in 1992 against a planned positive growth rate of 2 per cent as the deterioration in the economic situation was compounded by drought .  
She said that despite numerous laws , which guaranteed women social , political , economic and educational rights , certain traditions and values of a negative nature still affected attitudes towards women and impeded their real participation .  
In the same context , environmental degradation and its negative implications for longterm development must be addressed by improving and enhancing national capacities for the environmentally sound management of the natural resource base ;  
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
In this connection , in the opinion of the Ukrainian delegation , international cooperation between the United Nations and the new democracies should not die out , but , on the contrary , should be reinforced , bearing in mind that every positive process , unfortunately , also has negative consequences , which must be neutralized and eliminated ; this can be achieved only through the united efforts of representatives of the world community . 
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
The Assembly , considering that nuclear testing was not consistent with undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference , deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground nuclear testing and sharing the alarm expressed internationally , regionally and nationally , would strongly deplore all current nuclear testing and urge the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing .  
Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of ( a ) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium ; ( b ) priorities , reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature ; ( c ) real growth , positive or negative , compared with the previous budget ; and ( d ) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources ;  
We consider that the countries that are participating in ECOWAS and in the ECOWAS Military Observer Group ( ECOMOG ) are playing a key role in preventing Liberia from sliding into complete military and political anarchy and in preventing the breakup of the country which , without any doubt , would have serious negative consequences for the entire region .  
What is worse , the international community will continue to send a negative signal vis - - vis the United Nations , that of a lack of genuine commitment to the ideals and principles that inspired its creation half a century ago .  
In reply to the concern expressed by members regarding the neo-liberal economic model and as to whether action directed towards the prevention and reduction of its negative effects on women was planned or being taken , she informed the Committee that the Government had opted for a model based on growth with fairness . 
The representative stated that numerous studies showed the extent to which informal sector had contributed to the national economy , and it was also proved that women 's contribution to the informal sector could reduce the negative effects of the structural adjustment plan .  
She assured members of the Committee that , in spite of the current economic and political crisis in the Russian Federation and the sharp reduction in the capacity of the State to achieve the goals set by the Convention , the Government remained dedicated to the goals of women 's advancement and the elimination of discrimination against them and would continue to take measures directed at alleviating the negative impact of transformation on women and improving their economic and social position .  
Review the impact of structural adjustment programmes on social development , including , where appropriate , by means of gender sensitive social impact assessments and other relevant methods , in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and improve their positive impact ; the cooperation of international financial institutions in the review could be requested by interested countries ;  
To put those constitutional principles into effect , a vast national mechanism had been established , which had made it possible to predict and , to some degree , alleviate the negative consequences on women of the economic crisis , to include gender factors in State social policy and to take specific measures aimed at facilitating women 's adaptation to the market economy .  
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
Deeply concerned also about the serious consequences of the presence of refugees and externally displaced persons for the already difficult economic and social situation in Djibouti , which is suffering from prolonged drought and the negative effects of the critical situation in the Horn of Africa ,  
Agenda 21 calls upon all organizations of the United Nations system to play a key and active role in assisting Governments to establish more effective patterns of balanced economic and social development with minimal negative impacts to the environment .  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
Furthermore , the requests of the above-mentioned States for equating their own status with that of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not acceptable either from the political or the moral standpoint and could create a negative precedent for other States , leading to possible broader destabilization of the international community , in view of the fact that their independence was gained by forcible secession , prohibited by international law .  
Positive and negative developments in the external and national policy environments as well as successful and unsuccessful macroeconomic and microeconomic policies are reflected in the amount of resources available for the financing of cross-sectoral issues and sectoral finance .  
Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
It was agreed that the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in particular input subsidies , needed careful examination , with special attention being paid to distributive problems , especially that of the negative impact on the poor .  
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
Since the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women : Equality , Development and Peace , held at Nairobi in 1985 , and the adoption of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women , the world has experienced profound political , economic , social and cultural changes , which have had both positive and negative effects on women . 
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
It was noted that industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required the adoption of measures to create an environment conducive to private investment ; ( i ) The importance of reversing environmental degradation and addressing its negative implications for long-term development was stressed .  
The estimated requirements of $ 19,700 , reflecting negative growth of $ 31,500 , relate to the following expenditures : ( a ) public information production : reduced requirements of $ 10,600 would cover the cost of engaging external marketing research organizations and other related contractual services with a view to ensuring that the Department 's outputs are responsive to targeted audiences and their identified needs ; and ( b ) subscription to news agency services ( $ 9,100 ) . 
We are taking stock of negative , devastating and genocide effects of sanctions on the health of the people of Yugoslavia and demonstrate in an expert way , corroborated by arguments , to what extent the sanctions have held us back in the implementation of the health care of the population , how much damage , pain and evil was inflicted and how many innocent lives were cut off as a result .  
The provision ( $ 259,700 ) reflects a negative growth of $ 339,600 and would provide for the external printing costs of the Yearbook of the International Law Commission ( $ 27,700 ) ; and honoraria of the Chairman and 32 members of the Commission , one member being excluded from accepting the payment by national legislation , and additional amounts payable to 6 special rapporteurs , at the rates set by the General Assembly in its resolution 35 / 218 of 17 December 1980 ( $ 232,000 ) . 
" I informed them that it was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee and confirmed by the General Assembly resolution , that the renewed participation of the three permanent members of the Security Council , that had withdrawn from the Ad Hoc Committee in 1989 , would be most conducive to the success of the work of the Committee and added that I would welcome the views of those Governments , whether positive or negative , on how best we could proceed in this matter .

They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
The specific , defining feature of coercive economic measures is that of negative economic activities applied for political purposes , forming part of discriminatory or punitive interventionist policies .  
The negative economic impact on the target State depends on a variety of factors , such as the magnitude and scope of the imposed coercive economic measures , the relative size of the target vis - - vis the sender State ( i.e . , the degree of economic autonomy of the target State ) , and the availability of alternative economic options for the target State in terms of access to markets , capital , technology and investments .  
This in turn is likely to have a negative impact on international economic competitiveness , balance of payments and economic growth , as the shortfall in human skills resulting from the adverse impact of macroeconomic policy remains unaccounted for and unplanned for in terms of appropriate supportive measures and resources , thus rendering the policy unsustainable .

" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
His Government joined all those which were protesting against recent nuclear testing , which ran counter to the constructive philosophy of the moratorium proclaimed by the other nuclear Powers and had a negative effect on the current climate which was conducive to the negotiation of a complete nuclear test-ban treaty .  
While stressing the crucial importance of controlling greenhouse gases , he noted that setting reduction objectives without taking into account the possible negative economic impact on developing countries to which the Convention gave special attention could not be regarded as a comprehensive approach for the implementation of the Convention .  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;

Pakistan 's case , the tariffs applicable to certain products which were his country 's principal exports had been cut by less than one third ; in textiles , the waiver from GATT rules had been extended for another 10 years ; in agriculture subsidies for production and exports had been approved with the promise of reforms at some vague moment in the future ; and the measures taken in the area of services had had a negative impact on countries with abundant skilled manpower , such as Pakistan .  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
Neither its drafting nor its content is commensurate with the gravity of the Israeli aggression and its serious consequences for the people of Lebanon , who have been subjected to killing and displacement , let alone with the destructive negative implications for Lebanon 's infrastructure and for its Government 's tenacious reconstruction efforts and ambitious reconstruction plans after long years of a destructive civil war .  
The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
The desire of a number of countries , including the Russian Federation ( which as a result of the imposition of sanctions has suffered and continues to suffer very substantial material and financial losses ) to elaborate practical ways and means to prevent the negative consequences of sanctions or , at least , to keep them to a minimum , are therefore fully justified .  
The Committee noted with regret that the economic constraints resulting from the transition process were having a negative impact on women 's employment and health ; female unemployment was increasing and the quality of social services provided to women was deteriorating .  NULLIn addition , the state of health of the female population was unsatisfactory when judged by international standards .  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
If the amendment presented by Iraq , as contained in document A / 51 / L . 11 , concentrates only on positive aspects , we consider that operative paragraph 7 in its current formulation does not accurately reflect the delicate balance between positive and negative aspects , particularly as outlined by the Director General in his report and as stated in the IAEA resolution on the subject suggesting more positive than negative aspects .  
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
Therefore , in this initial period of democratic reform , international support and assurances are of crucial importance in alleviating or offsetting the negative economic and social consequences which economic reform and structural adjustment programmes usually entail .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
The Assembly has adopted a number of resolutions that have reflected its grave concern over the harmful effects suffered by the economies of developing countries and their developmental efforts as a result of these coercive economic measures , and over the negative effects of these measures on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to establish an open non-discriminatory trade system .  
At their annual meetings in 1996 , foreign ministers both of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77 called for the immediate elimination of all forms of coercive economic measures with negative , extraterritorial impact on the development of developing countries and which undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law and the free flow of trade and investment .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
It should have been removed from the agenda long ago on account of its negative political motive and in view of the fact that its substance is devoid of any subject not included in other resolutions .  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities that are sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly if State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , Governments should devise innovative privatization plans so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions performed before privatization ;  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
I am concerned about the imprudent behaviour of the south Korean representative , as it will lead to intensified confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and have a negative effect on international peace and security as a whole .  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
The fact is that subsidies may generate negative as well as positive economic and environmental effects , and the distributive consequences of removing subsidies also need to be considered : their net effect on economic and environmental welfare is thus an empirical question .  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
The Police Congress , which was attended by representatives of 33 police agencies from 27 countries , included debates on the following topics : ( a ) human resources , a competitive advantage in modern police operations ; ( b ) economic crime ; ( c ) terrorism : a strategy for its neutralization ; ( d ) information : its positive and / or negative effect on security and crime ; and ( e ) drug abuse and its incidence among children and youth .  
" Accuracy " : usually measured in terms of inaccuracy , defined as the maximum deviation , positive or negative , of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value .

Private consumption has also been weighed down by a number of other factors : higher taxes and social security charges and reductions in governmental transfers have dampened the growth of disposable income ; and in some countries the weakness of the housing market and the persistence of negative equity in privately owned houses , as well as the continued reduction of earlier levels of indebtedness , have also discouraged spending .

Another view was that the concept of crimes in international law was well established and that for acts of exceptional gravity such a characterization with its legal , moral and political dimensions and negative and condemnatory connotations was quite appropriate .  
A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .

However , if the application of mandatory sanctions in the case of an armed invasion of the territory of another State and a direct breach of international peace can be considered warranted from the point of view of the Charter and international law , in most other cases this can be - and has been - counterproductive and has had negative and destructive consequences not only for one or several States but for the entire international community .  
The Special Representative accepts that incidents taken out of context can be misleading and indeed that the media - in any society - tend to give undue weight to the violent , to the outrageous , to the negative , to what they deem newsworthy , at the expense of the prosaic , the positive developments that are occurring in everyday life .

The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
However , a hasty prohibition of landmines not accompanied by measures to strengthen stability , could have a negative impact , including on anti-terrorist activities .

The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
It is regrettable that paragraph 125 selected only two situations and described them as negative , without putting them within the proper context to which we referred to earlier , and without balancing them against the positive and consistent record of Iraq 's cooperation with the Special Commission and all its efforts in the implementation of its mandate as defined by the Security Council . 
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .

The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The international community as a whole has taken a stand on this subject , in a virtually consensual manner , in endorsing the objective of a total ban on anti _ personnel mines by a very large majority with no negative votes in United Nations General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 L .

The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .  
The practices and procedures outlined above have a negative impact on the economic , social and cultural rights of individuals and also on collective or communal rights ( right to development and right to a healthy environment ) .

I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .

Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries .

The declared purpose of the Strategic Framework , namely to enhance the synergy between the political objective of building peace and international assistance activities , and promoting greater effectiveness and coherence of such activities requires a positive and flexible approach and enhancement of resources for humanitarian assistance , not a negative and rigid approach or the reduction of the resources committed to humanitarian assistance .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .

Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
Moreover , it is necessary to use the positive and negative examples to conduct vivid and lively education on legal system in light of the realities of the economic and social life so that the vast number of people will know how to safeguard their legitimate interests and rights with the law and dare to wage the struggle against all sorts of conducts in violation of law .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .

On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " was aimed at effectively , completely and accurately practicing Deng Xiaoping Theory so that all issues in every sector and every corner of the society we live in are healthy and advanced , so that all negative , corrupt and evil issues will be minimized , and so that the overwhelming majority of the masses can genuinely feel that , throughout the vast territory of China , the Communist Party is good indeed !  
Particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has reviewed positive and negative experiences in socialist construction , successfully created a way of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and enabled scientific socialism to be energetic , vigorous and creative in this vast land .  
Under the leadership of the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core , our party emancipated its mind and sought truth from facts ; shifted the work focus of both the party and the state towards the building of modernizations that centered around the country 's economic construction ; gradually gave form to a basic line that guided the country 's work at the initial stage of socialism upon its in-depth summarization of both positive and negative experiences gained from socialist construction ;  
Our source disclosed that in 1993 , tapes on the execution of prisoners taken from court archives were sold to foreigners by two public security and court officials at the price of scores of ten-thousand yuan .  The tapes were " edited " and combined with documentary tapes on kidney transplants at hospitals and then handed over to the western media for repeated airing just before the International Olympic Committee was about to cast its vote .  The negative impact was so great that it cost China its bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .

At present , they are worried about how to stop losing more seats , and helplessly waiting for another splitting of the party .  These are totally passive and negative defensive thinking and tactics that have been carried out because there are no other choices , and this is a posture that is bound to lose .  
If the export growth rate for the second half of the year continues at the low level we saw in May - - or even lower , perhaps becoming negative growth - - industrial growth for the entire year will be hard pressed to reach 10% , while the GDP growth rate for the entire year may fall below the minimum target of 7% .  
Not only behavior criteria and ethical standards for leading cadres need to be adapted to socialist market economic rules and in line with the requirements of the times and with innovative spirit , they must also adhere to socialist value concept , avoid the negative impact of the market economy , and resist against such decadent thinking as mammonism , hedonism , and extreme individualism .  
The negative impact of economic globalization has not only caused unhappiness in poor countries but has also aroused strong opposition among various social strata such as environmentalists and trade union organizations in the developed countries , with the result that demonstrations against international meetings dominated by the developed western countries have continually escalated in recent years .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
Taiwan 's economic growth rate for the second quarter of 2001 was minus 2.35 percent , Taiwan 's economic growth rate for 2001 will be a negative figure for the first time , and Taiwan people have been complaining everywhere .  It fully showed : Taiwan authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has been extremely unpopular and come to a dead end .  If they still refuse to loosen their restrictions and facilitate the three cross-strait direct links as soon as possible , Taiwan 's economy will face an even greater disaster .

Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
One important reason , Jiang Zemin emphasized at the fourth plenary meeting of the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission in January of this year , for the failure to prevent some negative and corrupt phenomena , increasingly serious in some cases , in the party despite repeated interdiction efforts has been the failure on the part of CPC organizations and leaders of some localities and units to strictly administer the party in the form of failing to strictly educate , manage , and supervise CPC-member cadres , especially leading cadres .  
As the economy has been consistently mired in recessionary crises since the start of the transition , structural adjustment has been implemented not through manipulating differences in growth rate of different economic sectors , but through manipulating differences in the rate of decline of the sectors , resulting in the prominent negative and passive characters of the structural adjustment .

Without PNTR , China eventually will still join the WTO , but if following China 's WTO entry , such factors of disharmony still exist in Sino-US relations , China 's development after WTO entry will be subject to the negative impact of conservative forces coming from within the United States and from Congress , which is unfavorable to China in its bid to make better use of the opportunity of WTO entry to do such things as investing , developing foreign economic and trade connections , and system reform .

The strategic partnership established between China and the United States in the 1980 ' s has long since ceased to exist .  The 1989 Tiananmen incident and the US media 's consistently negative reports on China have made the US people even more hostile to the CPC-led government .  This has left an irreparable crack in Sino-US relations to a great extent , and created the soil and environment for the consistently anti-China rightwing conservative forces of the United States to attack and block China .  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
The development of the NMD and the TMD is bound to undermine global strategic balance , lead to a new round of arms race , and produce broad , far-reaching negative impact on international peace and security , on the process of international arms control and disarmament , and on the international non-proliferation efforts .  Such developments are compromising the regional confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the regional security .  
Many in the political circles , public opinion , and even the " vice president " Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] , all hold a reserved attitude toward Chen Shui-bian 's trip .  They believe that Chen Shui-bian 's trip does not conform to what is appropriate for the present time , is full of variables , and that it will be difficult to gain any positive results .  As well , they think it is bound to have a negative impact on the already turbid cross-strait relations .

In the first 10 months of this year , the overall level of consumer prices rose by only 0.1 percentage point .  If the government 's initiative act of raising prices , such as increasing charges for housing and public services for citizens , are factored in , the growth in consumer prices will remain negative .  The decisive role of the relationship between market supply and demand is still quite unstable .  
China began to adopt the export rebate policy in 1985 .  Since 1998 , the state has increased the rates for export rebates three times in an effort to address the negative effects caused by the Asian financial crisis , as well as to stop the deflationary trend .  The moves have powerfully promoted export and contributed significantly to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .

Because of the average 20 percent price cut , the average retail prices of pharmaceuticals has registered a negative growth for the first time .  
China 's grain production capacity has rapidly advanced in recent years but the cost has increased progressively at an average annual rate of 10 percent and the structural imbalance between supply and demand has manifested itself increasingly and had a negative effect on increasing peasants ' income and on state finances .  Except for rice , domestic grain prices generally have been 20 percent higher than prices on the world grain market during this period .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
However , taking into consideration the negative impact of the expansionary financial policy , there is a need to adjust the focus of the macropolicy in a timely manner and correspondingly weaken the " primary " impetus , to prevent the excessive accumulation of negative effects resulting from the prolonged implementation of the policy on expansionary demand and fully invigorate the vitality of supply and civilian-run enterprises by strengthening the " secondary " impetus , thereby laying a solid foundation for the long-term , sustained stability of the national economy .  
Though they have expressed various views or viewed the incident from different angles , people have unanimously maintained that the incident has completely unmasked the vicious nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult and has become a negative example which may serve as a lesson or a sharp warning for " Falungong 's " followers , who should wake up by now .

August was an opportune time : turnover in the stock market had shrunk to about a third of its normal level ; there was bad news as the Government announced that first-quarter GDP growth had been negative ; and rumours were flying around predicting the devaluation of the Renminbi and the severing of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar .  
As to the conventional overseas markets , exports to the United States also rebounded to a strong positive growth , on the back of sustained robust consumer demand in the country and with the negative impact of the earlier currency depreciation of the East Asian economies gradually dissipated .  
Generally speaking , our assessment is that the rise in local interest rates in the past several months could have some negative impact on Hong Kong 's export , industrial and commercial sectors and hence its Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , but any negative impact may be cushioned to a large extent by the present strong growth momentum in economic activity .

( b ) whether the movement of the price index has all along been a major consideration in determining the size of civil service pay adjustment , and whether an alternative formula has been adopted in the light of the price index falling to a negative level ; if so , of its rationale for that ?  
In deciding to offer a negative pay adjustment across the civil service this year , we have given careful consideration to all relevant factors under the existing civil service pay adjustment mechanism , including the net pay trend indicators derived from the 2001 / 02 Pay Trend Survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .  
" In the light of the prevailing economic situation , our serious budgetary position and the pay adjustment trends in the private sector , we consider that the pay offer of a negative pay adjustment in line with the net pay trend indicators is reasonable and has struck a balance between the concerns of civil servants and the interests of the community at large , " he added .

To stay outside the patterns of adult life and just hang out means to waste the most precious period of life of learning skills and knowledge . Also , given the disapproving attitude of others , it will be hard to avoid a decline in self-respect and self - esteem , which will have a negative influence on long-term prospects . At the same time , it is also a great waste of educational resources , social re sources and economic development .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative .

Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "

Because the open style of our questions elicited a wide variety of opinions , expressed in an even greater variety of ways , for ease of statistical presentation we have combined the answers into various broad categories such as positive , negative or neutral , while reflecting the more detailed content in narrative form .  
Analyzing the replies more closely , we discovered that the positive opinions were mainly centered on such aspects as Japan 's good infrastructure and its people 's unity , law-abiding nature and efficiency , while negative opinions were mainly to do with the Japanese being aggressive , cruel , treacherous and materialistic .  
Analyzing the content of the replies , in fact the positive and negative replies do not contradict each other . In other words , almost all our interviewees acknowledged that the Japanese army was both " brave and loyal " ( towards Japan ) and " cruel and ruthless " ( towards the countries they invaded ) . The only difference was in whether they personally tended to like the Japanese for this , or despise them .  
But unlike assessments of the Japanese , where people agreed on what that nation 's traits were but differed in which they chose to highlight , opinions of China 's performance were directly at odds with respect to the same criteria . For instance , those who gave good marks described China 's wartime performance as brave , indomitable , sincere and united , whereas those who gave a negative assessment thought the Chinese showed themselves to be cowardly , incompetent and divided .  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running .

However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years .

Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .

This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
" For fear of children getting ill , one ca n't simply deny the existence of germs , " says Wu Wu-tien . In his view , only by " immunizing " children-presenting them with a realistic view with both positive and negative examples , and so training their capacity for moral discernment and judgement-can one give them a mental rock to hold fast to when faced with all kinds of temptations , so that they are not easily led astray .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Says Lin Yi-min , secretary general of the Career Foundation : " People still look at things like safe sex , mature reflection on relations with the opposite sex , and not creating a burden for society as the key to ' whether it 's okay ' to have sex . " When young people still struggling to get a grip on the issue of sex run into problems , people immediately question whether they 're " ready for sex , " and worried adults almost always conclude in the negative .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
Moreover , various specialized medical centers that formerly carried the ball for epidemic illnesses-such as the hospitals dedicated to tuberculosis , leprosy , and even sexually transmitted diseases-have been compelled by market forces to close or restructure . Though the general hospitals that have replaced them have state-of-the-art facilities , they do not have an adequate number of negative pressure isolation rooms with independent climate control .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth . The teaching hospitals then inspected 69 regional hospitals , which , in turn , inspected 400 local hospitals . In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
An aging population , a decreasing birthrate and a consequent increase in the social welfare burden-people have long been tired of hearing such negative news but many neither want nor dare to think about how this unavoidable trend will affect our future .  
These may be times of vertiginous political and technological change , but we sometimes feel discouraged at the persistence of tenacious negative aspects of the human condition rooted in selfishness and in the darkest chapters of our history .  
Religious and tribal fanaticism , national psyches scarred by past traumas , totalitarian regimes , selfish interests , and more all these may play a negative part in determining the future of human society in the next century .  
Notwithstanding , real GDP registered a negative growth rate of minus 2.8 per cent in 1992 against a planned positive growth rate of 2 per cent as the deterioration in the economic situation was compounded by drought .  
She said that despite numerous laws , which guaranteed women social , political , economic and educational rights , certain traditions and values of a negative nature still affected attitudes towards women and impeded their real participation .  
In the same context , environmental degradation and its negative implications for longterm development must be addressed by improving and enhancing national capacities for the environmentally sound management of the natural resource base ;  
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
In this connection , in the opinion of the Ukrainian delegation , international cooperation between the United Nations and the new democracies should not die out , but , on the contrary , should be reinforced , bearing in mind that every positive process , unfortunately , also has negative consequences , which must be neutralized and eliminated ; this can be achieved only through the united efforts of representatives of the world community . 
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
The Assembly , considering that nuclear testing was not consistent with undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference , deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground nuclear testing and sharing the alarm expressed internationally , regionally and nationally , would strongly deplore all current nuclear testing and urge the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing .  
Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of ( a ) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium ; ( b ) priorities , reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature ; ( c ) real growth , positive or negative , compared with the previous budget ; and ( d ) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources ;  
We consider that the countries that are participating in ECOWAS and in the ECOWAS Military Observer Group ( ECOMOG ) are playing a key role in preventing Liberia from sliding into complete military and political anarchy and in preventing the breakup of the country which , without any doubt , would have serious negative consequences for the entire region .  
What is worse , the international community will continue to send a negative signal vis - - vis the United Nations , that of a lack of genuine commitment to the ideals and principles that inspired its creation half a century ago .  
In reply to the concern expressed by members regarding the neo-liberal economic model and as to whether action directed towards the prevention and reduction of its negative effects on women was planned or being taken , she informed the Committee that the Government had opted for a model based on growth with fairness . 
The representative stated that numerous studies showed the extent to which informal sector had contributed to the national economy , and it was also proved that women 's contribution to the informal sector could reduce the negative effects of the structural adjustment plan .  
She assured members of the Committee that , in spite of the current economic and political crisis in the Russian Federation and the sharp reduction in the capacity of the State to achieve the goals set by the Convention , the Government remained dedicated to the goals of women 's advancement and the elimination of discrimination against them and would continue to take measures directed at alleviating the negative impact of transformation on women and improving their economic and social position .  
Review the impact of structural adjustment programmes on social development , including , where appropriate , by means of gender sensitive social impact assessments and other relevant methods , in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and improve their positive impact ; the cooperation of international financial institutions in the review could be requested by interested countries ;  
To put those constitutional principles into effect , a vast national mechanism had been established , which had made it possible to predict and , to some degree , alleviate the negative consequences on women of the economic crisis , to include gender factors in State social policy and to take specific measures aimed at facilitating women 's adaptation to the market economy .  
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
Deeply concerned also about the serious consequences of the presence of refugees and externally displaced persons for the already difficult economic and social situation in Djibouti , which is suffering from prolonged drought and the negative effects of the critical situation in the Horn of Africa ,  
Agenda 21 calls upon all organizations of the United Nations system to play a key and active role in assisting Governments to establish more effective patterns of balanced economic and social development with minimal negative impacts to the environment .  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
Furthermore , the requests of the above-mentioned States for equating their own status with that of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not acceptable either from the political or the moral standpoint and could create a negative precedent for other States , leading to possible broader destabilization of the international community , in view of the fact that their independence was gained by forcible secession , prohibited by international law .  
Positive and negative developments in the external and national policy environments as well as successful and unsuccessful macroeconomic and microeconomic policies are reflected in the amount of resources available for the financing of cross-sectoral issues and sectoral finance .  
Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
It was agreed that the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in particular input subsidies , needed careful examination , with special attention being paid to distributive problems , especially that of the negative impact on the poor .  
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
Since the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women : Equality , Development and Peace , held at Nairobi in 1985 , and the adoption of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women , the world has experienced profound political , economic , social and cultural changes , which have had both positive and negative effects on women . 
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
It was noted that industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required the adoption of measures to create an environment conducive to private investment ; ( i ) The importance of reversing environmental degradation and addressing its negative implications for long-term development was stressed .  
The estimated requirements of $ 19,700 , reflecting negative growth of $ 31,500 , relate to the following expenditures : ( a ) public information production : reduced requirements of $ 10,600 would cover the cost of engaging external marketing research organizations and other related contractual services with a view to ensuring that the Department 's outputs are responsive to targeted audiences and their identified needs ; and ( b ) subscription to news agency services ( $ 9,100 ) . 
We are taking stock of negative , devastating and genocide effects of sanctions on the health of the people of Yugoslavia and demonstrate in an expert way , corroborated by arguments , to what extent the sanctions have held us back in the implementation of the health care of the population , how much damage , pain and evil was inflicted and how many innocent lives were cut off as a result .  
The provision ( $ 259,700 ) reflects a negative growth of $ 339,600 and would provide for the external printing costs of the Yearbook of the International Law Commission ( $ 27,700 ) ; and honoraria of the Chairman and 32 members of the Commission , one member being excluded from accepting the payment by national legislation , and additional amounts payable to 6 special rapporteurs , at the rates set by the General Assembly in its resolution 35 / 218 of 17 December 1980 ( $ 232,000 ) . 
" I informed them that it was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee and confirmed by the General Assembly resolution , that the renewed participation of the three permanent members of the Security Council , that had withdrawn from the Ad Hoc Committee in 1989 , would be most conducive to the success of the work of the Committee and added that I would welcome the views of those Governments , whether positive or negative , on how best we could proceed in this matter .

They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
The specific , defining feature of coercive economic measures is that of negative economic activities applied for political purposes , forming part of discriminatory or punitive interventionist policies .  
The negative economic impact on the target State depends on a variety of factors , such as the magnitude and scope of the imposed coercive economic measures , the relative size of the target vis - - vis the sender State ( i.e . , the degree of economic autonomy of the target State ) , and the availability of alternative economic options for the target State in terms of access to markets , capital , technology and investments .  
This in turn is likely to have a negative impact on international economic competitiveness , balance of payments and economic growth , as the shortfall in human skills resulting from the adverse impact of macroeconomic policy remains unaccounted for and unplanned for in terms of appropriate supportive measures and resources , thus rendering the policy unsustainable .

" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
This crisis has two sides : the negative one , which brought the war with all its repercussions , and the other side , which forced international public opinion and world diplomacy to accept some of the fundamental causes of the crisis of the Balkans , be they historical or actual , as well as the main party responsible for this crisis , that is the Serbs , with their medieval policy in the Balkans .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
His Government joined all those which were protesting against recent nuclear testing , which ran counter to the constructive philosophy of the moratorium proclaimed by the other nuclear Powers and had a negative effect on the current climate which was conducive to the negotiation of a complete nuclear test-ban treaty .  
While stressing the crucial importance of controlling greenhouse gases , he noted that setting reduction objectives without taking into account the possible negative economic impact on developing countries to which the Convention gave special attention could not be regarded as a comprehensive approach for the implementation of the Convention .  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;

Pakistan 's case , the tariffs applicable to certain products which were his country 's principal exports had been cut by less than one third ; in textiles , the waiver from GATT rules had been extended for another 10 years ; in agriculture subsidies for production and exports had been approved with the promise of reforms at some vague moment in the future ; and the measures taken in the area of services had had a negative impact on countries with abundant skilled manpower , such as Pakistan .  
economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
Neither its drafting nor its content is commensurate with the gravity of the Israeli aggression and its serious consequences for the people of Lebanon , who have been subjected to killing and displacement , let alone with the destructive negative implications for Lebanon 's infrastructure and for its Government 's tenacious reconstruction efforts and ambitious reconstruction plans after long years of a destructive civil war .  
The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
The desire of a number of countries , including the Russian Federation ( which as a result of the imposition of sanctions has suffered and continues to suffer very substantial material and financial losses ) to elaborate practical ways and means to prevent the negative consequences of sanctions or , at least , to keep them to a minimum , are therefore fully justified .  
The Committee noted with regret that the economic constraints resulting from the transition process were having a negative impact on women 's employment and health ; female unemployment was increasing and the quality of social services provided to women was deteriorating .  NULLIn addition , the state of health of the female population was unsatisfactory when judged by international standards .  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
If the amendment presented by Iraq , as contained in document A / 51 / L . 11 , concentrates only on positive aspects , we consider that operative paragraph 7 in its current formulation does not accurately reflect the delicate balance between positive and negative aspects , particularly as outlined by the Director General in his report and as stated in the IAEA resolution on the subject suggesting more positive than negative aspects .  
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
Therefore , in this initial period of democratic reform , international support and assurances are of crucial importance in alleviating or offsetting the negative economic and social consequences which economic reform and structural adjustment programmes usually entail .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
The Assembly has adopted a number of resolutions that have reflected its grave concern over the harmful effects suffered by the economies of developing countries and their developmental efforts as a result of these coercive economic measures , and over the negative effects of these measures on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to establish an open non-discriminatory trade system .  
At their annual meetings in 1996 , foreign ministers both of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77 called for the immediate elimination of all forms of coercive economic measures with negative , extraterritorial impact on the development of developing countries and which undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law and the free flow of trade and investment .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
It should have been removed from the agenda long ago on account of its negative political motive and in view of the fact that its substance is devoid of any subject not included in other resolutions .  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities that are sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly if State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , Governments should devise innovative privatization plans so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions performed before privatization ;  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
I am concerned about the imprudent behaviour of the south Korean representative , as it will lead to intensified confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and have a negative effect on international peace and security as a whole .  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
The fact is that subsidies may generate negative as well as positive economic and environmental effects , and the distributive consequences of removing subsidies also need to be considered : their net effect on economic and environmental welfare is thus an empirical question .  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
The Police Congress , which was attended by representatives of 33 police agencies from 27 countries , included debates on the following topics : ( a ) human resources , a competitive advantage in modern police operations ; ( b ) economic crime ; ( c ) terrorism : a strategy for its neutralization ; ( d ) information : its positive and / or negative effect on security and crime ; and ( e ) drug abuse and its incidence among children and youth .  
" Accuracy " : usually measured in terms of inaccuracy , defined as the maximum deviation , positive or negative , of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value .  
" Linearity " ( usually measured in terms of non-linearity ) : maximum deviation of the actual characteristic ( average of upscale and downscale readings ) , positive or negative , from a straight line so positioned as to equalize and minimize the maximum deviations .  
Private consumption has also been weighed down by a number of other factors : higher taxes and social security charges and reductions in governmental transfers have dampened the growth of disposable income ; and in some countries the weakness of the housing market and the persistence of negative equity in privately owned houses , as well as the continued reduction of earlier levels of indebtedness , have also discouraged spending .  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities , sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly where State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , innovative privatization plans should be devised so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions previously performed ;  
Links should be established or reinforced with media to avoid the negative reporting on children and youth in especially difficult circumstances and to further specific messages to enhance positive , social values fostering favourable conditions for accepting these children back into society .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
On the other hand , indirect effects , which are , largely , the induced effects of the former , represent mainly the negative impact on domestic variables and may include disrupted production owing to the absence or higher cost of sanctioned supplies , suspended financial inputs and services , foregone profit tax or tariff revenues , lost jobs and the need to increase social benefits .  
The energy sector ( petroleum and electricity ) has suffered considerable material losses as a result of the mandatory sanctions applied pursuant to Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) , and negative repercussions have been felt in most of the vital facilities and economic entities of that sector .  
" Deeply concerned about the significant decline in resources allocated to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , the incomplete tenth replenishment of the International Development Association and prospects for the eleventh replenishment at significantly reduced real levels , which has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions in pursuing collaboration and their role in the field of development ,  
Coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy , the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime more than four years ago now continue to exert their negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in the country .  
Also in that resolution , the General Assembly renewed its invitation to the international financial institutions to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on those States .  
By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .

In spite of the continued existence of certain discriminatory attitudes linked to negative aspects of the traditional culture , women in Burundi benefited from a legal framework enabling them to reach their potential in society , notwithstanding the state of war which still paralysed the country .  Burundian women 's associations had done much to promote the emancipation of women .  
Despite the negative effect of the financial situation of the United Nations , as pointed out by the Assistant Secretary-General for Public Information , great progress had been made in improving the work of the Department and innovating when implementing its programmes , thanks no doubt to its links with educational institutions , think tanks and national and local governmental institutions , as well as international media organizations .  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
Urges all States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those of a coercive nature with all their negative extraterritorial effects , which create obstacles to trade relations among States , thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [ 6 ] and other international human rights instruments , in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development ;

A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings due to low disposal incomes .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Despite the negative public perception created in some countries and the fears aroused about the dangers of nuclear proliferation , nuclear energy remains a viable and attractive energy option for many countries , and particularly for the fossil fuel-deficient developing countries .

To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
National strategies of economic reform and international cooperation must incorporate strong concern for the social implications in order to enhance the positive and minimize the negative effects of the global economy .

The reports of Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially the final report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1992 / 16 ) , contain a wide _ ranging analysis of how structural adjustment programmes have had negative effects on a range of human rights .  
The Committee considers that it is urgent , as a preventive measure , to change the gender selective approach in the law ; to develop educational courses to empower women ; to educate police personnel ; to introduce gender sensitive courses for judges , public prosecutors and lawyers ; to increase the number of shelters for battered women with children ; and to mobilize the media to introduce regular programmes on the negative consequences of violence .  
However , if the application of mandatory sanctions in the case of an armed invasion of the territory of another State and a direct breach of international peace can be considered warranted from the point of view of the Charter and international law , in most other cases this can be - and has been - counterproductive and has had negative and destructive consequences not only for one or several States but for the entire international community .  
The Special Representative accepts that incidents taken out of context can be misleading and indeed that the media - in any society - tend to give undue weight to the violent , to the outrageous , to the negative , to what they deem newsworthy , at the expense of the prosaic , the positive developments that are occurring in everyday life .

JUNIC agreed on the need to develop a joint message of the United Nations with global appeal , to be based on a critical analysis of both the positive and negative feedback from the recent coverage and public debate about the role and achievements of the Organization , and to consider a methodology of media outreach that would successfully counter the effects of the existing information overload .

After the lifting of the sanctions the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy and the accumulation of losses related to the implementation of the sanctions against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Iraq continue to exert a negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in Bulgaria .  
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
However , a hasty prohibition of landmines not accompanied by measures to strengthen stability , could have a negative impact , including on anti-terrorist activities .  The proper forum for the discussion of the subject of landmines is the Conference on Disarmament , where it is possible to carry out an in-depth study and discussion of the entire set of respective problems , including from the standpoint of their impact on the strengthening the security of interested States and international security in general .  
The somewhat positive performance by the service sectors is based on growth in the financial sector and , to a lesser extent , in community and personal services , as the preliminary figures for the remaining service sectors show negative movement .

The world is currently passing through highly interwoven and complicated circumstances , where progress and its horizons mingle with backwardness and its dangers while humanity takes pride in such achievements as economic progress and the development of technology and informatics , it is still suffering from the practices of terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime , the spread of corruption , the overflow of refugees , the challenges posed by war criminals , crimes of genocide and mass murder , and the negative effects of racism and religious discrimination . 
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
It is regrettable that paragraph 125 selected only two situations and described them as negative , without putting them within the proper context to which we referred to earlier , and without balancing them against the positive and consistent record of Iraq 's cooperation with the Special Commission and all its efforts in the implementation of its mandate as defined by the Security Council . 
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
There has been a rapid expansion in both formal and informal regional arrangements , driven in part by concerns over the potential negative impacts of globalization on national economies and by the positive prospects of regionalization .  
Reducing the worst inequities will depend on ( i ) international and national action to reverse the stagnant or negative economic growth patterns currently experienced in the lowest income countries ; and ( ii ) domestic policies ( in all countries ) which enable all sectors of society to benefit from growth .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The international community as a whole has taken a stand on this subject , in a virtually consensual manner , in endorsing the objective of a total ban on anti _ personnel mines by a very large majority with no negative votes in United Nations General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 L . As you know , France supported that text . 
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .

In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
They were urged to eliminate negative cultural practices and attitudes against girls and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls and the root causes of son preference , which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , inter alia , by enacting and enforcing legislation protecting girls from violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse and exploitation . 
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .  
The practices and procedures outlined above have a negative impact on the economic , social and cultural rights of individuals and also on collective or communal rights ( right to development and right to a healthy environment ) .  
While producing their own negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights in general and economic , social and cultural rights in particular , these phenomena have multiplier effects which also exacerbate the increasingly serious and numerous problems faced by the populations of poor regions .

I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .

The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries . 
The United Nations and the League of Arab States expressed their concern over the continuing problem of landmines and other unexploded devices that are causing serious human suffering and which have negative social and economic effects on mine-infested countries over an extended period .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
Further , the humanitarian considerations that the Holy See applies to economic sanctions were articulated by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano , Secretary of State , who stated that the Holy See hoped that the Security Council would be better informed about the negative effects , on a humanitarian level , deriving from the application of sanctions imposed on a State in strict application of the Charter of the United Nations .

Such negative attitudes often lead to passive or hidden discrimination against migrants , and recourse to civil remedies is constrained by the difficulty of proving formal violation of rights and the financial cost involved in the legal procedures .  
The situation of deadlock in which the Conference finds itself now in connection with procedural or organizational issues , which , it is true , have a very important relationship to the substantive consideration of the topics falling within the competence of the Conference , regrettably have a negative impact on its credibility , in which the international community has vested its confidence so that it will consider issues of disarmament and nuclear disarmament in particular . 
It has been aggravated by a number of negative social phenomena , such as the deterioration in the health of poor people due to poor nutrition , school leaving caused by a disruption in the normal functioning of educational and cultural establishments , and an increase in crime , and in the moral decay of adults , resulting in more and various forms of violence .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The negative aspects of the current economic situation must be reduced to a minimum and the enormous potential of the global market must be harnessed .  
The declared purpose of the Strategic Framework , namely to enhance the synergy between the political objective of building peace and international assistance activities , and promoting greater effectiveness and coherence of such activities requires a positive and flexible approach and enhancement of resources for humanitarian assistance , not a negative and rigid approach or the reduction of the resources committed to humanitarian assistance .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .

The growing light pollution makes increasingly large areas of the Earth unusable for astronomical observations , but the light visible from space also represents wasted energy for hundreds of millions of dollars and is beginning to have a negative impact on the environment in densely populated areas .  
Damage to oil refineries , fuel dumps and chemical and fertilizer factories , as well as the toxic smoke from huge fires and the leakage of harmful chemicals into the soil and the water table have contributed to as yet unassessed levels of environmental pollution in some urban areas , which may in turn have a negative impact on health and ecological systems .  
It is easy to see the negative effects for indigenous peoples of such a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors , not only on their initial sovereign condition , but also on their overall international juridical status .  
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
The Group is of the opinion that the careful management of worldwide legitimate stocks of ammunition , including the reduction of surplus stocks , combined with active encouragement for former combatants to hand over their stocks for destruction , can reduce the negative impact of the uncontrolled proliferation of ammunition in post-conflict areas .  
In this respect , a negative role is played by , among other factors , the country 's particular economic structure inherited from the former Soviet Union , which is incapable of meeting the requirements of a market economy ; Tajikistan 's geographic remoteness , which has a significant detrimental effect on external economic activity ; and mountainous terrain that makes a mere 7 per cent of our country suitable for human settlement .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .

The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .
