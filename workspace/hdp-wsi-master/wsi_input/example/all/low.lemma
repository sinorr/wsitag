In his report an American military scholar concluded that the US military strategy in Iraq is based on a " flawed " logic because it is pursuing two mutually independent goals of changing Iraq 's regime and doing it " quickly and at a low cost . "  
UNCTAD indicated that the excessive dependence on foreign capital , rapidly rising foreign debts , the low and unstable prices of primary products , the continuous spread of HIV / AIDS , and unceasing civil wars are all important factors that hinder the continuous economic improvements of the least developed nations .  
We have been all the while upholding the rule of law , keeping an efficient and administration-oriented government as well as honest and competent civil servants .  We have continuously improved qualifications of our working population , promoted free enterprise and free trade , ensured the free flow of information , maintained a stable budget system and healthy financial mechanism , pursued a prudent public financial policy and implemented a simple and clear low rate of taxation .  
Caohai is in the area controlled by the subtropical monsoon .  Caohai basin has high elevation and low latitude with an average yearly temperature of 11.6 degrees Celsius and an average yearly sunshine of 1,801 hours .  It has become a " paradise for migratory birds " and an ideal summer resort for its mild winter and cool summer , combined with many advantages such as abundant water flow , fertile land , densely-knitted swamps , and rich biological resources .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
Shanxi province is located at the intersection of the Mid-west and the East , and is also an important national production base for coal and electricity commodities , is abounding in resources , with low labor costs and land prices , and possessing an industrial foundation abundant in economy and technology and a broad market .  
We should take resolute steps to reduce and eliminate a number of technically backward production capacities which have a high energy consumption and a low economic efficiency and which have caused serious environmental pollution ; and give priority to supporting the development of large enterprises and enterprise groups which have advanced equipment , well-marketable products , and a strong ability to develop new products .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
In view of the drop in people 's income expectations and the rise in their expenditure expectations , and their insufficient consumption capacity , we raised the standard of the basic living needs of workers laid off from state enterprises , the unemployed , those urban residents eligible for the lowest basic living needs , and others on low incomes , and increased the wages of workers of organs , undertakings , and units , and the pensions of retired personnel .  
In combination with economic restructuring , knocking out backward production capacity , and upgrading industry , last year the industrial front focused on reducing surplus production capacity in sectors such as textiles , coal , petrochemicals , and the metallurgical industry ; and the banks refused to lend money for products with high production costs , low standards , and lack of sales outlets , thus opening up a market space for superior enterprises and evening out some of the market supply and demand .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
The initial stage refers to the historical stage in which the situation of the impoverished population accounting for a large proportion and the people 's living standards being comparatively low will be gradually changed so that the entire people will become comparatively prosperous .  
Qiao Xiaoyang said : Tremendous achievements have been scored in our country 's legislation work , but some problems have also cropped up in practical legislative work as legislation progresses at an accelerated pace and the number of laws enacted multiplies , such as legislation in excess of legal power , conflict and contradiction between different laws , regulations , and rules , low legislative quality , and lack of democratic procedures in legislation .  
However , the capital city 's education still has many problems which urgently need to be resolved : there remains a prominent contradiction between the growing education needs of the masses of the people and education 's insufficient supply in quantitative terms and low quality ;  
This reporter has learned from the meeting that under the present circumstances wherein its economy still remains underdeveloped , China has succeeded , thanks to its hard efforts in recent years , in bringing an unduly fast population growth under effective control ; its total fertility rate among women of child-bearing age has dropped below the supersedure level ; and the country 's population reproduction mode has experienced a historical change to one of " low birthrate , low death rate , and low growth . "  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
On the one hand , after China joins the WTO , import tariffs will be cut by a wide margin and this will help domestic ship owners , shipyards , and designing units directly use advanced , reliable , and fairly-priced , and serviceable complete sets of foreign ship equipment and spare parts with low prices .  
The electronic business is to bring electronic technology to the overall trade activities , and has the characteristics of low operational costs , a wide spread of electronic service subscribers , no limit on time and space , and direct interaction and exchange between electronic service providers and subscribers .  In addition , the capacity to make warehouses , goods shelves , and stores virtual has reduced the intermediate links , which in turn greatly reduces trade cost and trade cycle .  
It should be pointed out that the noticeable difference between the developing countries and developed countries is that due to being exploited and controlled by colonialism and imperialism for a long time in the past and now being at a low level of economic development , the vast number of developing countries are bound to place their state sovereignty , survival rights , and development rights at priority positions .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
As the majority of our products are of intermediate or low standard , we have had to import core key products from abroad ( such as CPU , DSP for mobile telecommunications , and so on ) .  Moreover , our country 's integrated circuits industry has also lagged far behind the international standard in terms of its seal and package technology .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Ours is a huge country with very low starting point .  And with difficult tasks ahead , it would be very difficult for us to face with complex contradictions , to organize and guide hundreds and millions of people to plunge into fierce competition in the new century , to realize our grand goals , and to find a foothold for the Chinese nation if we do not have a large number of the " solid rock " leading cadres who are trusted and supported by the masses .  
At present , the world socialist movement has fallen to a low point in its development while profitable relationships are adjusted by deepening the reform .  Furthermore , with the infiltration and the influence of decadent ideas and culture , corruption and other ugly phenomena grow and creep within the Party .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
The main points of dialectic materialism and historic materialism are : The world is material , unified , and interactively linked , and change is developed from low to high , from simple to complex ;  
The State Council recently held a conference in Shanghai on reforming the basic medical insurance system and pharmaceutical and public health system for employees in cities and towns throughout the country .  At this conference , the State Council expressly set out its general objectives of " providing relatively excellent medical service at relatively low cost and trying to satisfy the broad number of the people and the masses needs for basic medical service .  
In order to realize this goal , we must conform to the requirements of " low level and wide coverage " and adhere to the principle of associating individual accounts with comprehensive coordination in society .  Employers and employees should share the expense for medical insurance at a reasonable rate .  On this basis , we must balance the rights and obligations of the insured , ensure the collection of premiums for medical insurance and probe for solutions to balance medical costs that exceed the maximum sum .  
" Go ! "  No sooner had the group leader issued an order in a low , deep voice than the " special combat " soldiers set out by crawling out of the green curtain of tall crops .  In the twinkling of an eye , they submerged in the lake .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
A pertinent expert of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that some difficulties and problems still existed in the agricultural and rural economic operations at present .  The comparatively conspicuous ones included the relatively great impacts of drought , plant diseases , and insect pests on crops , the continued low prices of most agricultural products , the relatively numerous difficulties confronting the development of township and town enterprises , and so on .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
Building up the foundation and devoting effort to implementation are a process of endless circles and spiral ascent , which require repeated effort and effort at repetition .  However , this repetition is not simply a mechanical repetition on a low level ; instead , it requires that we should - - along with the deepening of reform , development of the situation , and the real situation of the units - - continuously adapt ourselves to new issues , study new problems and resolve new contradictions .  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
On the one hand , when the Russian planes suddenly entered the defense zone , the aircraft carrier 's onboard could be subjected to electronic interference from the Russian fighters which made the target display indistinct ; on the other hand , personnel manning the radar could be overly negligent , overlook the suspicious target , did away with effective tracking and monitoring , which enabled the Russian planes to fly extremely low when coming near the aircraft carrier and entered the radar 's blind spot .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
The rapid development of modern aircraft-borne weapons systems ; the surface-to-air missile units which are capable of reaching high-precision hit rates , fast operational response , wide shooting ranges and multiple targets ; and the anti-aircraft artillery units have formed into an air defense system of crossing firepower at high , medium-high , and low altitudes .  
In the exercise of " continuous attacks by submarines against an enemy frigate formation " organized by the base in early November , commanders of the " Red " and the " Blue " sides carried out confrontations without giving advance notice on their operational intentions .  Strong winds and heavy storms happened to be ragging at the sea area where the drill was conducted .  Large sea waves and low visibility increased the difficulty of spotting the targets .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
At the same time , we clearly recognize that Tibetan socialism is built upon a unity of politics and religion and the ruins of feudal serfdom with a weak economic foundation , low starting points and late start-ups .  It has remained in bondage for thousands of years , and these things still interfere with economic growth and social development .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
Military exercises have been held without interruption .  What is different is that these military exercises have not been conducted in the areas sensitive to Taiwan and have been announced , as were before , by Beijing 's official authorities in a low key through the sensational Hong Kong media .  
Chen Shui-bian 's burning task at the moment is to find out , externally , a highly adaptable political medium who has a diversified attribute and a low and incorruptible political feature , just like the old Siew . In addition , Chen Shui-bian should continue to have Yuan-tseh Lee [ Li Yuan-che ] , a renowned scholar refusing to associate with officials of doubtful reputation , reinforce the consensus within the country .  After this , he will be able to launch an attack in the chess game .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
Such a mentality can easily create a nationalist sentiment , which the right-wing forces take advantage of to " guide according to circumstances . "  Given the social background that the Japanese economy has been stagnant for a long time and that the masses are in low spirits , they have incited a narrow nationalist sentiment under the banner of opposing " national self-maltreatment " and restoring national self-respect in a vain attempt to drag Japan into the morass of militarization again .  
As the aircraft had flown at a low altitude for a long time , the temperature had risen to as high as 50 degrees centigrade inside the cabin , where the crew had become rather tired , sweating all over .  Nevertheless , they were still tightly bending over the portholes , carefully looking at each and every object floating on the sea surface and waiting for a miracle to happen .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
All localities , in the light of local situations , should clearly set the objectives , focus on key tasks , and strive to achieve practical results .  We should not only decidedly wipe out criminal forces and pressure groups already uncovered , but also should expose criminal forces and pressure groups that have been lying low and have not been exposed and clamp down on them .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin listened in detail to the account given by President Wang Dazhong . With great interest , Jiang saw the digital television launching and receiving system and the special chips used for the system with China 's own intellectual property rights , the 500-meter-long high temperature superconductor material , biological material , and other products .  He also asked about the scientific research network for China 's education , application of low temperature heat reactors , and optical communications .  
The laser guns , deployed in fixed positions or installed on mobile vehicles , can effectively shoot down and destroy attacking ballistic missiles , high and low altitude supersonic cruise missiles , ultra high speed stealth planes , and military targets at sea .  
Thanks to all these efforts , batches after batches of high-end cadres with high educational backgrounds have been recruited into the military , and have gradually become a main force in the contingent of cadres of our army .  However , there still exists a wide gap between our army and foreign armies in the cultivation of high-quality talent .  For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
The cunning small plane continued to climb lower in altitude and tried to shake off our planes by flying at low altitude .  Deputy group chief Li therefore circled the small plane at a low altitude in order to prevent the small plane from " slipping through the net " and to avoid a midair collision .  
Right now , a considerable number of domestic enterprises are relatively low in standard .  Some of our enterprises carry out extensive management , while others are backward in technology and equipment .  Still others are weak in carrying out technical innovations .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
As revealed , the new model of antisatellite satellites that Russia 's new space force will be equipped with is two to three metric tons in weight and four to six meters in length and has an operational altitude of 5,000 km .  It can attack reconnaissance , navigational , and meteorological satellites deployed by an enemy in low Earth orbits as well as space planes .  
Russia will raise the quality of training for war preparations .  The two Chechen wars exposed the low level of the Russian military 's preparations for war and its lack of training and other problems .  Therefore , starting last year , the three services of Russia started to reform the military training system , increasing training time and frequency , expanding training scale , and fully utilizing modern high technology to improve the quality of training according to the requirements of the " Military Doctrine " and reform plan .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The difference is that combined operations are dominated by synergy of different arms based on a dominant arm , supplemented by the support among different services , so as to form an overall operational power within the systems of the arms .  They normally serve the purpose of achieving tactical objectives and the operational strength , means of command , and formats of operations are relatively unvaried and the degree of synergy is relatively low .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
Seen from the history of the international communist movement , our party experienced various high tides and low ebbs , favorable and unfavorable circumstances , successes and errors , and various twists and turns , and successfully withstood the stern tests of strong winds and waves , always standing firmly aloof as a mainstay in the torrents of history and successfully creating the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
We firmly believe , that under the leadership of the spirit of this fourth seminar held by the central committee on the work in Tibet , and through the united struggle of all levels of the region , both high and low , especially the united struggle of the broad mass of farmers and herders and of grass-roots cadres , we will certainly be able to accomplish the goals and tasks of the work of assisting the impoverished and of development during this new stage . 
In light of this situation , the office has pooled its backbone technical personnel .  After more than one year of hard work to overcome key problems , they have developed a new type of missile for military training .  Compared with regular missiles , these missiles for military training purpose are low in manufacturing cost .  They can be used several thousand times .  Therefore , they are highly welcomed by military units .  
The western provinces and regions have vast land , great market potential , rich resources , low labor costs , unique comparative advantages , and tremendous development potential .  
From the traditional point of view , Chinese products have the advantage of lower prices because of lower production costs .  Despite the fact that today the people have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance competitiveness by improving production quality and services and adding new features , the practice of increasing market share by exporting more low-priced products remains prevalent .  This has prevented Chinese products from ridding themselves of their " poor quality and low price " image .  Moreover , lowering the price often gives others an excuse to file anti-dumping lawsuits .  
An expert said that China 's steady economic growth was not easy at a time of worldwide economic slowdown .  He said China 's economy could maintain its great vitality because of the pull from stronger internal demand when external demand was low .  
A responsible official of the State Council Legislative Affairs Office told reporters : The situation on China 's population front has undergone major changes .  Stabilizing the low birth rate and improving the quality of the newborn population have become the primary mission of our population and family planning work .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
If the export growth rate for the second half of the year continues at the low level we saw in May - - or even lower , perhaps becoming negative growth - - industrial growth for the entire year will be hard pressed to reach 10% , while the GDP growth rate for the entire year may fall below the minimum target of 7% .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
For several days running , fishermen braved the sweltering heat and the choppy water alongside the unit 's officers and men .  Together they assembled , laid low waiting for the right opportunity , set off rapidly , and launched joint attacks , thereby honing their skills in carrying out joint attack , defense , and rescue operations at sea .  
It can move : it can carry special combat operations elements , exploit the cover of complex weather and climatic conditions , break through defenses at low and extra low altitude , and conduct destructive combat operations in the enemy 's rear .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
With high functional density , short lead time , low costs , and other special features , small satellites are extensively applied to mobile communications , resources exploration , forest conflagrations , flooding , and marine monitoring , and yield social and economic benefits , becoming an important industry for countries with advanced aerospace technology .  
Over the past 20-odd years , the Chinese Government has overcome various difficulties .  It has successfully transformed a contingent of leading cadres who were quite old and whose educational levels were quite low into another contingent of leading cadres who are " relatively young " and " knowledgeable . "  Immediately afterward , it has vigorously launched another round of reform in the systems governing cadres and personnel which aims to be more democratic in the process of hiring officials .  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .

In terms of technological structure , the low technological level is a grave defect of the non-public economy .  In the sections where the technological level plays a decisive role , such as the manufacturing section and the new economic section , the non-public enterprises are usually at an unfavorable position while competing with foreign enterprises .  
In spite of the extremely low probability of a release of nuclear radioactive substance from nuclear power stations and nuclear facilities , various countries are taking strict preventive and nuclear emergency measures to prevent the damage to and adverse effect on the environment and public if a serious nuclear accident should happen by any chance .  
To be sure , we are fully aware that China is a developing country with over 1.2 billion inhabitants , a weak economic base , a low per-capita output value , and imbalance between its different parts in their economic development standards .  Therefore , we have put forth an important strategy to promote the development of west China .  
This responsible person stressed that based on the high or low quality level of the military cadres selected from general high level universities , speaking in a definite sense , their level of quality impacts the entire level of military development and the success or failure of our undertaking .  
In the field of culture , the feudal ideology has not been eliminated , the capitalist decadent ideas and the unhealthy and corrupt tendencies within the party still exist , and the people 's educational level is low , which have seriously affected the process of China 's modernization .  
( 2 ) Such arenas and facilities as " patriotic education bases , " " science and technology education bases for teenagers , " and " moral education bases " named by the state and relevant provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal departments must be open to teenage students at low rates or , given attempts are vigorously made to create the conditions , for free .  
( 3 ) All other types of public cultural facilities - - museums , memorial halls , science and technology halls , cultural centers ( stations ) , sports arenas ( gymnasiums ) , theaters , workers ' cultural palaces ( clubs ) - - and enterprises and institutions , cultural and sports facilities affiliated with social group , and extracurricular education facilities must uphold the principle of public welfare , extend the hours opened to teenage students , and be open to teenage students for free or at low rates during festivals and holidays .  
The existing main problems are a low overall standard of product quality , a low ratio of up-to-standard products in a considerable number of categories , the persistent act of producing fake and shoddy products in defiance of repeated bans , and the poor work in supervising and regulating quality .  
Latest statistics show that the average price of rolled steel nationwide has increased sharply in the first half of the year , putting an end to the low prices that continued over the years .  The price is now at a reasonable level of 2,300 to 2,450 yuan per ton .  
The official responsible for the State Administration of Environmental Protection said that the main reason for the relatively low rate of key state enterprises fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements is the outstanding structural pollution in the state 's key enterprises , the difficulties in tackling pollution , depression in enterprise production , and a lack of capital .  
Various policies such as raising the export tax rebate rate , starting to collect interest taxes , promoting steady tax-expense reforms , and raising the income of low income urban residents , etc . , have resulted in significant increases in exports during the first half of the year and in the total retail value of consumables , effectively stimulating consumer demand .  
With the development of the socialist market economy and the deepening reform of the grain circulation system in our country , however , the traditional central grain reserves management system and operating mechanism obviously lagged behind , its functions were not separated from those of the government , its responsibilities were not clearly defined , and its other problems such as low efficiency and rigid management were conspicuous .  These problems adversely affected the security of grain reserves .  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
if they are not careful , they might even die in those strange places .  The factory owners also pointed out : Chen Shui-bian disregarded mainland China 's markets which are nearby and only separated by a narrow Taiwan Strait , where laborers are abundant , and where investment costs are low .  
The party Central Committee and the State Council have always paid close attention to this policy , cadres at various levels have worked hard to implement it , and the broad masses have actively responded to it .  As a result , tremendous achievements have been made in our country 's population and family-planning work ; the over-rapid growth of population has been brought under effective control , and our country 's birth rate has dropped to below the replacement level , joining the ranks of countries with low birth rates .  
Enterprises engaged in the manufacturing and circulation of pharmaceutical products must exert to improve their internal management .  In particular , they must do away with the practice of " iron rice bowl " and " everyone eating from the same big pot , " renounce administrative protection and improper methods of management , and win market shares by relying on their superior products , superior service and relatively low costs and prices .  
Jiang Chunyun said : Owing to the limitations of its social development level and its natural environment , the level of work in population and family planning as a whole is relatively low in the west , except for a few areas ; the types of population reproduction [ ren kou zai sheng chan lei xing ] are changing , and the average population growth rate is on the high side , but the quality of the population is on the low side .  
He said , viewed from the industry , state-owned enterprises depend heavily on the high international oil prices , the low interest rates of banks , the conversion of debts into shares , the relief of their social functions , and other measures at the macroeconomic level .  Internal factors at the microeconomic level , such as the lowering of the costs of enterprises , the improvement in quality , and the readjustment and optimization of structure are still insufficient .  
As for Chen Chao-min , the repeated charges are : The case of rape and murder of a young girl at the Operations Command of the Air Force and the case of stolen guns and ammunition at the Taoyuan base , both of which have involved wrong verdicts ; backstage deals for personnel appointments , incompetent leadership , low operational rate for second-generation fighter planes , exodus of pilots , and so on .  
When dwelling on the tasks facing flood prevention and drought control , Wang Shucheng emphasized that rapid economic development has set increasingly high demands on flood prevention and water resources protection .  However , the current flood prevention standards of major rivers remain low .  If we do not consider flood diversion methods , the dykes of major rivers can only resist the floods occuring once in 20 years , and small and medium-sized rivers can only resist minor floods and will be in flood when medium floods occur .  
The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .  
Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
Feasible and effective measures should be adopted according to the specific conditions of various areas and industries .  Priority should be given to the central and western regions of the country , the main grain producing areas , and areas where peasants ' income remain at a low level .  It is necessary to stop the downward tendency in peasants ' income as soon as possible .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
Agricultural development has changed from the resource constraint of the past to the dual constraint of resources and market ; problems such as irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low comprehensive returns on agriculture , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes are becoming more conspicuous by the day , and these set new and still higher demands on the development of agricultural science and technology .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
Since the beginning of winter , there have been six major snowfalls in the eastern and central parts of Inner Mongolia . The low temperatures and accumulated snow throughout an extensive scope have become disastrous to 1.6 million people in 31 banners and counties of five leagues in the autonomous region , and a large number of domestic animals have frozen to death .  
We must change the method of simply considering structural adjustment as increasing or decreasing the acreage of crops , and avoid the practice of developing low level and redundant production and the situation of " everyone has the same thing . "  We should pay attention to keeping local characteristics of agriculture and develop and expand " advantageous crops while making improvements in primary production " so as to let peasants gain maximum benefits in the course of structural adjustment .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .  
Ours is a big developing country with a population of nearly 1.3 billion , where the level of economic and social development and the people 's living standards are still rather low ; in such a situation , our country also has a tremendous demand potential and very vast market space .  
These included decent economic growth , moderate inflation , low employment , flexible labour market and tight discipline in the management of public finances .

It allows us to keep the existing freedoms and life style of our people ; it protects the right of private ownership ; retains for Hong Kong a separate currency and customs territory ; and it reaffirms our long established policies of prudent financial management and low taxation . "

He emphasized that the long-standing objective of the Government was to maintain an overall environment favourable to economic growth , through providing a sound legal and institutional framework , a simple tax system with low tax rate , a stable financial sector , well - developed infrastructure and an efficient Government machinery .  
" It is inappropriate and often misleading to describe the actual change in households ' well-being without taking into account the various welfare provisions by the Government including free-subsidised education service , low cost public housing , free medical care , retraining and other government subvented welfare services all of which contribute to improving the living standard of the disabled , the elderly , the single parents and the low income households , " the spokesman added . 
My Administration will work to preserve Hong Kong 's special characteristics - the rule of law ; open and accountable government ; prudent fiscal policies ; low and predictable taxes ; personal , social and economic freedoms , and a civil service that is efficient and honest .  
" We are the freest society and most vibrant economy of our time because Hong Kong has always practised free enterprise and free trade , insisted on prudent financial management policies and keeping a low taxation system , upheld the rule of law and placed emphasis on an efficient , executive-led government and a quality oriented civil service , " he said .  
On Hong Kong 's position as a premier financial centre , Mr Tsang said this would be strengthened by increasing training , by greatly improved financial communications infrastructure ; and above all that , by maintaining the rule of law , freedom of information , low , simple and predictable tax rates and open markets .  
" We have in place a business friendly environment , a prudent fiscal policy , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services .  
" All the favourable conditions in Hong Kong which have underpinned our robust development in the past , such as our prudent financial policy , low taxation , sound financial and banking regulation , first-rate infrastructural facilities are still there and unaffected by external factors . " 
Our attractions are manifold .  Among those most commonly cited are our superb physical infrastructure , our simple tax regime and low tax rates , our well developed financial support services and regulatory system , the rule of law and in general a very business-friendly environment .  
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
For some remote residential areas within these districts , located well away from major noise sources , the general background noise level may be comparatively low and hence noise generated from passing aircraft may become more audible .  
Mr Tsang said Hong Kong was still probably the freest economy in the world with no restrictions on capital flows , a stable and freely convertible currency , no restrictions on gold or silver trading , no duties payable on virtually all goods , no trade quotas , a low tax system , the rule of law and a fast unfettered flow of news and information .  
On the fixed penalty system for littering offences , the Steering Committee considered that the existing level of fine which , on average , was about $ 400 was too low to produce sufficient deterrent effect .  
More importantly , Hong Kong 's edge over the other East Asian economies has been underpinned by a host of other factors , such as a good quality labour force , a low and simple taxation system , a stable government , a corruption free society , an efficient transport and telecommunications infrastructure , sound legal and regulatory systems , free flow of information , and most important of all , a huge and rapidly growing hinterland just to the north of Hong Kong , " Mr Tsang said .  
" The Government 's position on the issue is self-evident on the relevant legislation we have on the statute books barring discrimination .  But we still prefer to carry our message forward by sticking to our proven low key approach , mainly through public education and administrative measures .  
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
Given the advanced development of forensic analysis , it is now possible to take a buccal swab ( being a non-intimate sample ) to obtain a buccal cell sample by wiping a swab along the inside of the cheek part of the mouth of a person which is sufficient for analysing the DNA profile of that person .  This method is quick , efficient and the degree of interference is low .  
Notwithstanding the fact that the Hong Kong economy operates with a relatively low gearing , as evidenced in the high savings rate , the extreme interest rate volatility translated into substantial falls in both stock and property prices and in extensive pain for the community as a whole , over and above the pain already being experienced through economic adjustment . 
The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the rule of law , efficient public administration , prudent fiscal policy , simple tax system with low tax rate , sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services , so as to preserve and wherever possible lift further Hong Kong 's competitive position in the world .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the smaller decline in consumer prices in October 1999 than in September was mainly attributable to dissipation of the effect of the 50% cut in the rates payable in the third quarter of this year .  Also relevant was a low base of comparison in the fourth quarter of last year , when a rates rebate was granted .  
Based on the approved EIA report undertaken by the consultants , given that the number of vehicle trips per day is low and the material transfer station is not close to the nearby residents , no adverse environmental impacts to the nearby residents are anticipated from the operation of the works area .  
The corner stones of Hong Kong 's success - the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field for business , a low and stable tax regime , a freely convertible currency , the free and unfettered flow of information , press and other freedoms - had been preserved and protected since reunification .  
Internally , the Government will maintain the bedrock of its economic and trade policies , viz low taxes , free trade , free flow of information and the rule of law .  Building on such fundamental principles , we will keep upgrading our hardware ( infrastructure ) and software ( human resources and institutional framework ) in the continuous strive to sharpen our competitive edge and make perfect our business environment .  
It was reported that the Liaison Office of the Central People 's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( " the Liaison Office " ) asked leaders of the local Catholic diocese to adopt a low key approach in handling activities in celebration of the Vatican 's canonisation on October 1 of 120 Catholic missionaries and their followers who had been killed in China a hundred years ago .  The diocese later disclosed also that some scheduled religious exchange activities with its Mainland counterparts had been put on hold , probably due to the said canonisation .  
These include the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary ; open and accountable government ; a clean civil service ; a level playing field for business ; a duty-free port ; low taxes ; free movement of goods , capital and people ; the free and unfettered flow of news information and ideas ; and a whole range of freedoms guaranteed and protected by our constitution , the Basic Law - for example , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , of expression , freedom to travel .  
Yet the market lost momentum soon after , along with the slides in the US and Tokyo stock markets , the heavy plunge in telecom and technology shares worldwide , and also the setback in financial shares .  The Hang Seng Index fell back to a 17-month low of 12 583 on 23 March , before recovering slightly to stand at 12 761 at end-March 2001 , 15% lower than at end-2000 .  
However , the known approaches in defining poverty tend not to take account of the assets held by individuals , usually only reflects the position at one particular point in time and takes no account of intangible income derived from Government spending on key social services such as housing , health and education , welfare etc .  They therefore understate the economic effectiveness of these services in improving the situation of low income families .

These include free market policies ; a high degree of autonomy ; a highly efficient government , a legal system based on common law ; the low and simple tax regime ; a level playing field ; free and instant flow of information ; and protection of intellectual property rights .  
In the light of the above , and given our low and simple taxation system , and the competing demands for resources to fund worthwhile human and social development programmes in the years ahead , we , the Government in conjunction with the community , need to carefully examine the long term sustainability of our existing social security schemes .  
( c ) It is a well established principle of the Government to strive to maintain a business-friendly environment , including a robust legal system , a clean government , a simple taxation system with low tax rates , a level playing field and free trade .  It is meant to enable the business sector to give full play to its dynamism and advantages , and as a result drive the robust development of the Hong Kong economy .  
This will create huge room for development for Hong Kong 's enterprises .  With our many unique advantages , such as the rule of law , a low tax rate , a clean government , a solid financial system , the free flow of capital and information , and a wealth of knowledge about the Mainland and international markets , Hong Kong will be able to contribute to the further development of the Mainland and , in the process , find new impetus of growth for our own economy .  
Then the 911 incident aroused widespread anxieties in the global financial markets , causing the Hang Seng Index to plummet to a near three-year low of 8 934 on 21 September , 14% down from the pre-911 closing level .

These include a low tax regime , efficient banking services , excellent communications , modern infrastructures , a sound legal system , business-friendly policies , a clean and accountable civil service as well as a highly educated and skilled workforce , " she said .  
These factors included political stability and security , rule of law and an independent judiciary , corruption free government , infrastructure , press and information freedom , a sturdy banking and financial system and a low and simple tax regime .  
The Government will strive to provide an institutional environment that is conducive to market development , in particular , to reinforce Hong Kong 's institutional strengths , such as the rule of law , a level playing field , clean government , free flow of information , a simple and low tax regime , and an efficient and effective market-regulatory system .  
( c ) whether the level of rents of the Cyberport offices is lower than that of the offices of comparable quality in private commercial buildings ; if so , whether the unfavourable tenancy position of the Cyberport offices is the reason for the Administration 's setting low rents to attract tenants ; whether they have assessed if such a measure will result in a competition for profits with the private sector and deal a blow to the rental market of private commercial offices ; and  
The favourable ratings given to the five most important factors - low and simple tax system ; political stability and security ; free flow of information ; rule of law and independent judiciary ; and corruption-free government - point to why Hong Kong remains the preferred location for regional operations in this region .  
The Heritage Foundation acknowledged that Hong Kong 's virtues included a duty-free port , very low barriers to foreign investment , very low level of restrictions in banking and finance , low level of intervention in wages and prices , strong property rights and a low level of black market activity .

To help people plan outdoor activities especially water sports , astronomical and tidal prediction data two years in advance will be available on the HKO website starting today .  The new data will include time of sunrise , sunset , high and low tides for any day in 2004 and 2005 .  
The Government also monitors the local pump prices of unleaded petrol and ultra low sulphur diesel against monthly average Singapore FOB prices ( the generally accepted regional benchmark for pricing in the Asia Pacific Region ) .  
" Cases in foreign countries showed that vulnerable infants like hospitalized prematures , low birth-weight and babies with underlying medical conditions can fall ill after consuming infant formula contaminated with the bacterium .  
He urged corporations in both the public and private sectors to actively consider issuing bonds as a means for raising capital in light of the current market environment of record low bank deposit rates and uncertain equity market .  
While the differential treatment for child allowance between the first two children and the third to ninth child is unlikely to have a significant impact on the decision of a couple regarding the size of their family , the differential may not be appropriate in the light of our very low fertility rate and has been removed as from the current financial year .

" We believe that a slight upward adjustment in the profits tax rate and the deeming assessable profits rate for certain royalties and licence fees payments will not hurt Hong Kong 's competitiveness , as investors continue to be attracted to Hong Kong to set up businesses because of our low , simple and predictable taxation regime , which will remain as one of the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's system , " Mr Ma said .

Summer is the time for this seasonal fruit . Markets and fruit peddlers ' carts are piled up with fresh pineapples delivered to the towns from the growing districts . The unique fragrance of pineapples carries afar . Their bright yellow meat is sweet and juicy , their prices low .  
The most intensive care must be taken from the time the baby takes solid food to the day the first school-year begins . Mothers must be very careful about choosing diets for their babies , with stress on high protein , low fat and digestibility . The daily menu should include steamed blended eggs , such meats as tender roast beef , liver , chicken , duck and fish as well as milk and fruit , in addition to indispensable nutriments like calcium tablets , cod liver oil and multi-vitamins .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
Though the advent of free markets is supposed to have brought improvements in amounts of goods for sale and improved service , the shabby stalls , aged vendors and lack of variety in commodities gave mute evidence of weak purchasing power , low consumption standards , and general poverty .  
In clean pan , fry until fragrant one stalk of coarsely chopped green onion &amp; 5 small pieces of ginger ; then add 10 pieces of bamboo shoots and continue frying . Sprinkle with 2 T soy sauce .

Many children of upper level cadres were admitted despite their low academic standards , while many outstanding students were rejected . Because my father had run a textile business before the Communists gained power , I was naturally considered part of the capitalist class .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
Extremely well suited to fresh water cultivation , Taiwan boasts one hundred such farms . A stable , warm and humid climate is available on Taiwan , as are over 40,000 fish and irrigation ponds throughout the island which are suitable for raising the fresh water mussel ( anodonta woodiana ) . Initial investment is minimal as mussels are cheap , food costs are low and little sophisticated equipment is necessary .  
At a time when foreign currency reserves were low , the purchase of U . S . $ 2,000 worth of fruit trees seemed wasteful . Chiang Ching-kuo reassured Sung that money spent on scientific research was never a waste .  
Many importing countries , strapped by foreign debt , pay particularly close attention to the terms and amount proposed by bidders . In 1979 the ROC government established the Export-Import Bank to assist local makers , granting long-term repayment schedules at low interest rates . In addition , should a foreign customer fail to make good on his payments , the bank will reimburse the Chinese firm and take legal action overseas to recover the debt .  
His singing voice must be pure and clean , and his speaking voice low and measured . His movements and gestures must be restrained and steady , what actors call " on the up-and-up . "  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
The sound of the waking clappers is actually very low , which the ordinary people generally can not hear as they sleep . The monks are tranquil and quiet in body and mind ; to them , even a falling twig can be heard , not to mention the clappers .  
One type of entertainment we discovered back then - - which had both aural and visual appeal - - was watching the quilt man fluff up the cotton for the inside of quilts . Tbe big quilt-beating bow suspended from his back and the wooden mallet he held in his hand made a low , reverberating noise that at times rang out sharp and clear . The sound had a natural rise and fall to it , a complex yet orderly melody that was quite pleasant to hear .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
During their first winter they discovered that the mountain , situated some 2,000 meters above sea level , had at least 1,000 hours a year of temperatures below seven degrees centigrade , making it a rare region of low temperatures in semitropical Taiwan and highly suited for growing temperate-zone crops . "  
Attempts were made by the first director to restore the interior to its former splendour . He had seen what Victoria 's workmen had removed and was given permission by the queen to select items from the boxes in which they lay and begin returning them to the Pavilion . Yet it was an uphill struggle and by the years of World War , after such a long period of public use , which included it being used as a hospital for Indian soldiers during World War , the once splendid building had hit a new low point .  
Despite the low completion rate for advance sales of new housing , the fact that the land was often bought at a time when prices were booming , together with high advertising costs , have meant that construction companies have only limited capacity to absorb the development costs themselves . From the consumer 's point of view , buying in advance and paying as the building nears completion offers an excellent way for salary earners to pay by instalment . Thus prices have only fallen by a meager 10-20% .  
Craftsmen have traditionally been held in low regard in Chinese society , but by dint of devotion to his calling and the artistry of his work Li has frequented the doors of the rich and famous and been treated on an equal footing by the powerful and elite . He has his own ideas on the subject .  
Those who finished high in the number of interpellations expressed satisfaction that their daily diligence at pursuing public policy is finally laid out for the public . Others are busy trying to defend themselves , patiently explaining to reporters why their numbers of interpellations are so low , or so biased in content toward a single side .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
The pay for a general civil servant is divided into " base salary " and " supplementary salary . " It differs according to rating and position . Ratings , from low to high , go from designated rank to recommended rank to selected rank , with the lowest being designated rank-1 and the highest selected rank-14 ( equivalent to an office director ) .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 . Not only did that familiar image of the family grouped around the radio set vanish , but one researcher at the time even found that many interviewees were unable to help with his survey for the simple reason that they never listened to radio at all .  
A schoolmate of mine who was put in a class for gifted students and then ranked low on several tests began to doubt her abilities , which she had always been praised for . She lost all her self - esteem , tested poorly into high school and later even dropped out . She changed completely for the worse . She became antisocial and terribly defensive , " she relates sadly . "  
Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
Of course this is related to our fitting in with Malaysian national policy - - to develop the east coast and to develop agriculture , " says Lin , explaining their " good luck . " Although Malaysia is an agricultural country , it only has palm oil and rubber as relatively well developed cash crops . They rely on imports for most other agricultural products like fruit , rice , and vegetables . Production of aquatic products is also low , so that agriculture has always been one of the sectors with investment incentives .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
We rested on a platform that seemed to overlook the whole planet . The settlement was visible far away at the mountain 's foot , girdled by a white stream flowing in a bow-shape to its left before meandering off into the west to shake hands with a row of low clouds .  
In accordance with an assessment made by China Engineering Consultants , the Yushan National Park Administration decided that the land was unstable and liable to frequently collapse along the 50 odd kilometers of the planned cross-island route from Yuli to Tafen . The maintenance costs , they determined , were high and the economic value low .  
Moreover , products mined or gathered using explosives , drilling and digging have more fissures , the colors are not uniform and the quality is low , so the prices are also inferior . Besides , most of the rock gets smashed and lost , so that only ten or twenty percent is actually worth keeping .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
Because Ilan is at a low altitude and has many springs , the roots find it easy to quench their thirst and the trees ' crowns grow lush and full . Full of springs and developed by man relatively late , the areas where the mountains meet the plain have most of the remaining banyans .  
Because people have greater contact with the outside world and easy access to information and because everyone , particularly the middle class , is paying increasing attention to quality of life , when people see that consumer goods in Taiwan are of low quality and high price , they seek happier shopping grounds abroad . This is one method of obtaining more reasonable consumer quality .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
Taiwan 's history is not all centered on the Western plains . The aboriginal peoples have been living here for thousands of years . " He says that human activity in Taiwan has a vertical distribution from ancient to modern times and from high to low . Even the highest mountains show traces of human presence .  
A splendid photo opThe most plentiful species was the Japanese White-eye ; between 20 and 30 of them played in the tree . They self-assuredly pecked fruit , heads held high or dipped low , not even frightened away by the sound of a car door opening and closing under the tree or the rumble of an engine .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
From the international perspective , the global economy has been dragging along at a low ebb for some years now . There have been many reports of layoffs , salary cuts , and plant closings , even for established multinational giants . It was only in the middle of 1994 that light showed at the end of the tunnel , and the turnaround that is making everyone so pleased only really began then .  
For instance , the tall and lanky General Hsieh whirls like a white crane spreading its wings opposite the short and stocky General Fan , who squats low and makes monkey-style kungfu movements . " Each of the dancers has a different character , and there is a dialogue between them , " says Chen Li-e , going on to explain that the generals ' movements and positions can be varied flexibly depending on the size of the space in which they perform .  
But in hunting and fishing society with its low productivity , faced with the harsh realities of nature and a lack of material resources , people gradually extended the range of resources they could use . For instance , the Oroqen people of northeast China once had a taboo against eating bears and tigers , but gradually came to eat bear meat and use bear skins for clothing . But a people which faces the constant threat of death and hunger both needs animals and fears them , and this has given rise to many hunters ' taboos .  
The places to which they have scattered are unusual , as well . Some live high up at the Sun Yat-sen Hall atop Yangming Mountain , and some live down low near Keelung Harbor . Some can be found in tightly guarded army ammunition factories , and in nuclear power plants . Several generations of students and teachers meet to have fun together , and everybody feels as close as one big family .  
When cooking , the meat is first scalded in hot water and then immediately placed into cold water to cool it down , then slowly simmered over a low heat with a sachet of seasonings . Beef cooked in a clear broth in this way will be chewy and flavorsome , while the broth has a fresh meaty taste and there is no need at all to add MSG .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
There are no strict requirements for the registration of the dog population , so the rate of stray dogs being picked up by owners is low . City and County animal shelters are also extremely lacking . Even private organizations are overwhelmed . For instance , the Stray Animal Home , which can shelter 300 animals , was packed to overflowing less than three months after it opened .  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
The definition of porcelain is still a matter of some dispute , but in China the usual distinguishing criteria are that porcelain is fired from china clay at high temperatures over 1200 ( earthenware is fired at around 700-800 , or sometimes up to 1000 ) ; its surface is vitrified by the high kiln temperature ( earthenware may be unglazed or sealed by a low-temperature glaze ) ; and its body is pure white in color , is translucent , has low porosity , and rings brightly when tapped .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
In the boundless expanse of flat paddy fields , a thick wall of greenery , behind which one glimpses a home with green trees , a blue sky , grey tiles , a low red brick wall around , and whitewashed walls . Following the winding path which twists its way along the low banks between the fields , the front door comes into view .  
The Huayu Foundation has held seven classics courses for children . Every time the kids come to class , they must first put on dark blue robes and bow in front of a statue of the great sage Confucius . Then , while sitting cross-legged at low tables , the class recites fluently in loud and clear voices from the works of the Song dynasty Confucian scholar Zhang Zai , " I set myself to understand the ways of Heaven and Earth , and to bring peace and stability to the people .  
Later , during the Wei and Chin dynasties , and during the period of the division of the country into north and south , the " nine official ranks system " was adopted , further consolidating the feudal system . It was said that " No poor families could attain high rank , and no wealthy families would be given low rank . "  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
Seed boxes recreate the natural environment with artificial day and night and corresponding temperature changes , after which " winter " arrives , and the seeds are stored at low temperatures . The process can not be hurried , and it demands far more patience of the silviculturists than propagating the Taiwan red cypress or Taiwan cypress , whose seeds ' dormancy can be broken in a week or two given adequate water and light .  
New Zealand is large and sparsely populated , and seems much like a paradise . I remember when I went to Auckland ten years ago , life was relaxed and orderly , prices were low , and there were lovely boutiques all over the city . Outside the cities was an endless expanse of meadows and trees . I felt only that God had made a beautiful place at the tip of the world , and that New Zealanders were very lucky .  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
Guatemala is more than 108,800 square kilometers in area . The land is high in the south but low in the north . Guatemala City , located in the middle of the country , stands at an elevation of 1,500 meters above sea level . Its climate is cool , almost as if it were naturally air-conditioned .  
The southern Taiwan sun beats down on the low , densely packed buildings of Er-kung New Village , a military dependents ' community in Tainan County . In the morning market , the crowds seem to boil . In contrast , the expansive grounds of Our Lady of the Assumption Church , located in the center of the village , seem particularly cool and serene .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Southeast Asia and the mainland entice firms with their low production costs and their market potential . In addition , about 70% of the economic strength of the region is concentrated in the hands of Chinese business people who , in turn , are closely tied to Taiwanese business people . This drew many Taiwanese to the region more than 10 years ago , making them some of Southeast Asia 's earliest foreign investors .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
Taiwanese has survived only because people of Fujianese ancestry are the majority in Taiwan . However , though policies designed to suppress the use of all dialects ( such as fining or hanging humiliating placards on students who spoke dialect in school , or restricting time dedicated to programming in local dialects as did the broadcasting law promulgated in 1976 ) the impression was deepened that Taiwanese was relatively crude-a " low class " language that , though perhaps more intimate , was not suitable for elegant situations .  
A new 42-move form was established for the Asian Games , with contestants being judged on their facility in the form , including points such as whether a leg is raised high enough or if movements performed from a low squat are executed with sufficient power . The competitive element has attracted many young people to taijiquan , but has also provoked controversy within martial arts circles .  
Competitors were judged according to very rigorous standards . The head had to be kept centered , shoulders low , elbows down , arms loose , fingers extended , the breath drawn from the abdomen rather than the chest , etc . To aid in judging the skills of the competitors , the rules put special emphasis on large , sweeping moves . In addition to leg lift , fist form , step form , palm form , fluidity , and coordination , the competitors were also judged on style and rhythm .  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Filling the open spaces around the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung , and crowded onto nearby rooftops , some 20,000 spectators , including over 200 local and international journalists , were waiting for the action-an enormous number given the usual low attendance at art events .  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
Moving further into the garden , you find a motorcyclist popping a wheelie across the lawn , a sprinter racing over the low hurdles , a high jumper doing the Fosbury flop , and other athletes doing stretches , gymnastic routines with hula hoops , etc . All these works are part of the Living World Series . Each life-sized athlete is made of painted bronze cast upon a mold formed from an original work made of tightly bound sponge .  
The Nankang Hills stretch across the Taipei Basin as a straight finger of low sandstone peaks 140-370 meters high . Their highly uneven topography , carved out by the abundant local rainfall , has meant that despite lying cheek by jowl with the city , they have been spared destructive overdevelopment and have been able to maintain a basic forest environment . The hills ' great diversity of microenvironments creates a paradise for ferns .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
The appeal of a divine being that loves all mankind did n't find a ready audience in Chinese who still had their original brush with the West-looking down the barrel of a gun-fresh in their memories ; people were suspicous of the relationship between Christian doctrine and economic interests ; and they got life-saving medicine side-by-side with life-destroying opium . People were not well educated and standards of living were low , so there was fear and prejudice against foreign culture .  
What is more , ST &amp; T 's energy controller has many advanced functions , such as automatic readings and an " intelligent electric meter . " Users can set a monthly energy usage limit that will trigger an alarm when exceeded . Or it can be programmed to remind you that energy appliances such as dryers are best used when the rates are low at night . The user can even install intelligent modules on separate electrical devices and conveniently and precisely control the energy use of each .  
" As far as the explosive power of volcanoes goes , the lava eruption was much more moderate , " says Tsao Shuh-jong , section chief of the Division of Original Geology in the Central Geological Survey . In addition , basaltic lava has a relatively low silicon dioxide content , so it is correspondingly less sticky . Flowing basalt thus forms very different shapes from the lava of a typical volcanic eruption .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
One of these university freshmen had a camera , and on the summit he suddenly had a flash of inspiration to combine the majesty of nature with a portrait of the liberated human body . He asked his buddy to pose nude , with his head bent and body leaning at an angle . To get the image he desired , the photographer crouched low .  
As well as the high incidence of oral clefts , the number of children born with craniofacial deformities in Vietnam is also very high . Clinicians believe this is related to factors such as environmental pollution caused by the use of chemical agents during the Vietnam War , and the low standard of living which means that most pregnant mothers are poorly nourished .  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees . Even if high-quality products are raised , in light of the multiple layers of exploitation existing throughout the sales system and the dumping of low-priced products on the market , farmers are frequently unable to earn a profit .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
On some tours , as well as birdwatching and learning about coastal plants , tourists also ride out to the tidal zones to see how oysters are raised and collected . At low tide , they enjoy the sight of crabs digging their holes , and visit ponds where hard clams are grown . Later , as the tide rises , they return to the shore to enjoy magnificent views of the sea over the now-submerged oyster beds .  
This long-standing practice of raising tilapia with other livestock kept tilapia prices low , though its bacterial counts were somewhat elevated . Tilapia makes a delicious dish commonly consumed at family meals , but its strong earthy taste and humble image can not be shaken off .  
The owner of a Japanese-style house was fined NT $ 50,000 for " over-pruning " a tree . This fine was reportedly low , as the Department of Cultural Affairs took into consideration that the tree was only trimmed in response to neighbors ' concerns that in summer mosquitoes would thrive in its dense leaves . The law 's lowest fine was levied , with the warning that a second violation would be punished with the heaviest fine , NT $ 100,000 . However , the owner was very unimpressed .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
Before the morning dew on the pink petals of the mountain rambling roses has evaporated , and as the flowers ' soft , subtle fragrance arrests the steps of the passer-by , suddenly the sound of helicopter blades gets closer . Those on the ground directing the work shout to the others immediately to vacate the drop zone and get down as low to the ground as possible .  
The low temperatures make it tough for the workers to go on but if a typhoon should strike the high mountains , with their ubiquitous steep cliffs , the men are petrified . In 2003 Huang Chao-ying won the contracts to rebuild the Hsuehpei and Sumita shelters , located along the Shengleng trail . Work began at the end of August and in September two typhoons hit . " On hearing the news warning of the typhoon , everyone left .  
This lowered his morale . Due to these frustrations , there was a time when Wang considered giving up . But then he considered his original vow to help , and also how he himself had had discipline problems in school : fighting , bullying , low grades . The affirmation and care he received then from his church elders guided him out .  
Boosted by record low interest rates since the beginning of the year , an atmosphere of optimism surrounds the real estate market throughout Taiwan . Offers ranging from upmarket homes in Taipei City , to townhouses in central and southern Taiwan with ads touting 100% financing , have stirred awake many people 's long-silent itch to buy .  
With this , the owner finally relented and parted with his beloved gramophone . In 1998 , while in India , Lin discovered a 1921 British-made large-horned two-track stereophonic gramophone . This machine utilized one phonographic needle to feed two separate acoustic pickups featuring diaphragms of different thickness to produce high and low notes . This was one of the earliest two-track stereo systems .  
Chang specifically targeted seasoned pedagogues who were at or close to retirement age , reasoning that it would be the best way to attract true lovers of the teaching profession . Such individuals would be teaching primarily for the sheer pleasure of it rather than merely for profit . The teachers ' essentially altruistic persuasion along with their experience and dedication would combine to create an academic atmosphere high in quality but low in expense .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
The third is temporary interest-reduction bonds , where interest rates start from a very low level and rise over several years , followed by payment of a variable interest rate calculated as a floating international base rate plus a fixed margin .  
If the probability of late effects is proportional to effective dose at low doses , which is probably the case , the collective effective dose is an indicator of the total attributable harm to be expected in that group and its descendants .  
For example , in Malawi a low - cost operation based on voluntary contributions and the involvement of the international community in Malawi and the region also allowed broad geographical and chronological coverage of the electoral process .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , was not yet sufficiently understood .  
In contrast , in many African countries the humanitarian crises manifest a low point in a continuing process of structural deterioration compounded by internal conflict or externally induced destabilization .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , is not yet sufficiently understood .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
Given the low level of voluntary contributions , it would also be desirable to prioritize training programmes based on their comparative advantage and to develop high quality programmes in cooperation with relevant national and other institutions .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
The aim of a comprehensive financial reform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale , reflective of Members ' real capacity to pay , automatically adaptable to changed national circumstances and giving consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita incomes .  
As I have stated , not only is it not true that a majority of the people voted for continued or enhanced territorial status , not only did fewer than half of the eligible voters vote at all , but because of the low percentage , the referendum , on its own legal terms , was invalid .  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
Economic development and increasing per capita incomes in rural areas may be expected to be accompanied by substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels not only in modernized agriculture and transportation but also in households , especially if prices in real terms remain as low as in recent years .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
Many non-governmental organizations feel that progress could be faster , pointing to continued forest damage and the apparently low levels of grass-roots involvement , and calling for the implementation of the FAO Peasants Charter to correct skewed land ownership or access patterns , which concentrate human pressure on the few forests that are accessible to the poor , thereby contributing to their degradation and loss .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Despite the success in providing compulsory primary education for girls and boys under adverse conditions , the quality of the education system and educational achievement are not satisfactory because of overcrowded schools , double shifts at the elementary level , lack of maintenance , inadequate teacher training , lack of educational material and low salaries . 
The latter 's objective is to enable people with low incomes in the Appalachian region successfully to enter the economic mainstream by , inter alia , organizing cooperative ventures among small firms to produce for niche markets , mobilizing financial resources on behalf of the region from outside , creating learning clusters in conjunction with other communities in the country , providing transitional support for people moving from welfare to work , and developing production and leadership skills .  
They noted the general satisfaction expressed by the Inspectors with competitive recruitment examinations , but wished to seek clarification from them regarding the apparent contradiction in paragraphs 65 , 67 , 78 and 79 of the report , which stated , on the one hand , that the quality of staff members recruited through examinations had improved and , on the other , that the general level of candidates was rather low .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
The Committee was informed that as a result of the reduction in the number of leased armoured personnel carriers in UNAMIR ( see para . 38 above ) and the anticipated low use of those vehicles , the revised cost estimates for the period from 10 December 1994 to 9 June 1995 should be reduced ( a ) by $ 649,900 under spare parts , repairs and maintenance and ( b ) by $ 317,000 under petrol , oil and lubricants .  
During the work on the new arrangement and the present draft resolution , which will be adopted today , one Member State , regrettably , expressed low tolerance for the legitimate interests of Croatia , a Member State , and instead directed efforts into forms of short-term political pragmatism , at the expense of legal and operative logic of the relevant United Nations documents .  
In addition , UNDP and the Government of France co-sponsored an international workshop in September entitled : " Implementation of Decentralized Rural Electrification Programmes Within A Sustainable Development Perspective " which identified viable low carbon paths to economic and social development that can be supported by the GEF .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
At 1305 hours on 11 January 1995 hostile aircraft flying at low altitudes broke the sound barrier over the complex belonging to the State Establishment for the Petrochemical Industries in Basra Governorate , the strong shock waves produced causing physical damage and the breakdown of some items of equipment and machinery .  
The economy is dual and is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with a high purchasing power but almost strictly dependent on imports .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;  
NULLWhile it is true that a high rate of investment is not by itself sufficient to bring about sustained development , no developing country has achieved sustainable , vigorous economic development with low rates of investment .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
In the end , the design concept involved the elements of a vertical city in the park ( a tall rectangular slab ) and an integrated civic centre ( composed of the slab , a low General Assembly building and a horizontal link , the Conference building ) .  
As a result of the sanctions , it has become increasingly difficult to satisfy minimum existential needs , especially in the case of the unemployed , the employed with low income and family income below a social minimum , pensioners with low pensions and family incomes , families with children , elderly rural households , etc .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
It noted that rural economic production was increasing from a very low base and that self-sufficiency in food production is achievable provided additional inputs to existing programmes are made available .  
40 Given the typical characteristics of rural areas , such as sparseness of population , lack of trained personnel , low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services , it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
The symposium identified the main reasons for the lack of a systematic strategy for the provision of comprehensive health care in refugee situations : the low priority accorded to it by organizations specialized in emergency response ; insufficient field staff with appropriate training ; limited funding and resource allocation ; insufficient coordination among national authorities , non-governmental organizations and United Nations organizations and agencies in the country of asylum ; and consideration of family planning as a sensitive issue in post-conflict situations without seeking the views and support of refugee women .  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency . 
Human activities that can contribute to forest decline include pollutant depositions , overgrazing when woodlands are used for pastoral purposes , insensitive harvesting operations , the use of plantations with low genetic diversity , the accidental introduction of pest species , fire , the alteration of hydrology and , finally , the anticipated climate change associated with the burning of fossil fuels and increased concentration of greenhouse gases .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
On 13 July 1995 , aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " penetrated over Cuban territorial waters north of our capital , entered prohibited zone MU-P1 and overflew over the city at very low altitude , dropping leaflets and behaving in a dangerous and careless manner .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
In addition , prenatal exposure to illicit drugs and factors such as premature birth , low birth weight and poor relations between the child and care-giver in early childhood have been identified as problematic in relation to later development and , consequently , as precursors of the risk factors listed in the table above .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
The observed trend of a larger increase in minimum than in maximum temperatures is apparently linked to associated increases in low clouds and aerosols and to the enhanced greenhouse effect .  
Additionally , urgent social and economic priorities and severe capital constraints lead to low policy priority for any specific and additional mitigation or adaptation measures .  
Many poverty-stricken low latitude countries with rapid population growth , high illiteracy and large deficiencies in terms of trained manpower suffer from a complex water scarcity , in the form of particularly problematic environmental conditions with which they must cope , such as monsoon climates , erratic rainfall and poor soils . 
In summary they are those whose ownership of assets or access to productive resources and whose capacity to participate in new opportunities is so low as to make it difficult for them to have the basic minimum of consumption and services required for a decent life .  
The low national saving levels characteristic of the region 's economies , and the limited volume of investment resulting from such savings , will only allow them to grow at moderate rates ; therefore , unless savings and capital formation increase significantly , an accelerated economic growth rate can not be achieved .  
In view of the low level of contributions registered during the past biennium , the Board emphasized the Institute 's urgent need to make an active and strong fund-raising effort , to ensure an adequate flow of contributions to its Trust Fund .  
Among them were the following : their removed location from sources of information and special components ; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements ; the lack of qualified suppliers , which resulted in more expensive in-house process development ; and a less efficient country infrastructure .  
The unsatisfactory housing situation was attributed to a number of constraints , including the lack of a national housing policy and implementation strategy reflecting current and prospective economic realities , inadequate delivery of land for housing , the lack of financial mechanisms that cater to the needs of the low - and middle-income groups , and high construction costs in relation to incomes .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Maintenance of " old habits " is reinforced , in addition to spiritual and cultural traditions , through a low level of social and geographical mobility , strong social control exerted by communities and - paradoxically - the socialist system enforcing uniformity in society .  
Mainly because of the prevailing low rates of both public and private saving , lack of competitivity in international trade and some ill-adapted economic policies , African countries did not succeed in mobilizing the aggregated $ 82.5-billion that were to come from Member States to support the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development over the period from 1986 to 1991 .  
Two recent assessments for industrialized countries have included specified functions such as recreation , conservation , protection , hunting and grazing , and for each have shown the total forest area broken down into importance classes - high , medium and low .  It has also given a verbal account of " hot " political issues .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
The general population 's lack of income-earning opportunities and low purchasing power , combined with increasing prices and decreased availability of basic goods on local markets , have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
Given that Mozambique takes off from an extremely low economic base and after factoring in population increases , the prevalence of the recent trend of lacklustre growth performance would translate into GDP per capita increases too modest to make a visible contribution to , and to sustain , the goals of poverty reduction , social sector development , reconstruction and restoration of external viability .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
His delegation shared the belief that the programme resource requirements for operational activities for development should be granted due priority and supported the idea that the system resources previously allocated to outdated and low priority programmes should be reallocated to economic development with an emphasis on realistic project evaluation , strict performance compliance and strengthened oversight and investigation capabilities to preempt fraud and the mismanagement of the dwindling resources of the Organization .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
For example , in trade policy , when a low uniform tariff rate is applied to all products , any extra amount spent on luxury goods deprives the industrial sector of scarce foreign exchange .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
Consequent to the low tariff rates , imports had increased while economic development and exports had been circumscribed by , in addition to other causes , exogenous factors including the restrictive policy of other countries coupled with the sluggish and diminished flow of both private and official funds .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings due to low disposal incomes .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
The privatization of the economy is being completed , the level of inflation has been steadily low , the national currency is stable and liquid , and for the first time in a little more than five years of independence we have registered economic growth . 
The Task Force on Employment and Sustainable Livelihoods conducted one review in a country where poverty eradication was the primary focus in a setting of low economic growth and rapid labour force expansion ; in another country , the main concern was how to move from structural adjustment to growth with equity ; in another , the review focused on the employment aspects associated with a shift from a planned to a market-oriented economy .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Important issues highlighted by the participants for consideration in cadastral surveying and land management included the recognition that the success of a cadastral system was dependent not only on its legal or technical sophistication , but also on whether it protected land rights adequately , and permitted those rights to be recorded ( when appropriate ) efficiently , simply , quickly , securely and at low cost .  
The Committee was concerned about the low level of occupational achievement by educated women and male dominance in technical and professional fields , on the one hand , and the concentration of women in the lower-paid service sector , in particular the tourist industry , on the other .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
Djibouti has a dual economy that is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and secondly , by a modern economy , based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with high purchasing power but one that depends almost entirely on imports .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
It was therefore disturbing to note that the average level of ODA as a proportion of the gross national product ( GNP ) of developed countries had fallen in 1996 to a record low of 0.25 per cent .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
Moreover , the Agencys working capital reserves representing the difference between assets and liabilities in the regular budget had been driven to a dangerously low level , so that at the end of 1996 , they amounted only to some $ 5 million , or the equivalent of less than one weeks share of the Agencys normal monthly expenditures of $ 22-million .  
The proportion of endemic villages having access to safe water was still quite low , however , and only half of the villages possessed water filters in good condition , the treatment of surface water did not include all endemic areas , the supervision of community-level agents was inadequate and the information to lower levels insufficient .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
His delegation supported the recommendations contained in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the report concerning the continuing relevance and importance of the principle of a low per capita income adjustment , and it agreed to the Committee 's proposal that the future scale of assessments should be based on gross national product .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
A typical user terminal , operating at an uplink bit rate of between 128 and 768 Kbps , would employ a small-aperture antenna with a diameter of 66 cm and a solid-state power amplifier ( SSPA ) of 1-3 W . All radio frequency components ( SSPA , low noise amplifier , and up / down-converters ) would be integrated into a small outdoor unit mounted on the reflector . 
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Those included : exposures from natural sources of radiation ; exposures from man-made sources of radiation ; medical radiation exposures ; occupational radiation exposures ; dose assessment methodologies ; epidemiological evaluation of radiation-induced cancer ; deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair and mutagenesis ; hereditary effects of radiation ; combined effects of radiation and other agents ; models , mechanisms and uncertainties at low doses ; and local exposures and effects of the Chernobyl accident .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings owing to low disposal incomes .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
In India , for example , where the overwhelming proportion of the work force is engaged in the unorganized or informal sector which should not be confused with the illegal sector , as has sometimes been done the extent of unemployment or underemployment measured by the criterion of time spent at work is relatively low .  
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
It was indicated that the initial assumptions had been somewhat optimistic and that slower programming and low implementation is also attributable to the fact that increasingly projects are supported only by earmarked contributions , limiting UNDCP 's flexibility to be responsive to emerging priorities .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
This document addressed a wide range of problems , including a worrying increase in crime throughout Bermuda ; low deployment of officers on patrol ; an excessively high ratio of officers of the rank of superintendent or above ; an extremely low proportion of civilian staff ; and police stations and accommodation that were cramped , badly designed or not of an acceptable standard .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In South-East Asia strong economic growth along with a relatively large and rapidly expanding population base has attracted a great deal of interest from Western investors in all areas of the agricultural and food chain , especially in processing and distribution .  Although the level of imports in most cases is relatively low for processed horticultural products , in some markets ( e.g .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
A significant proportion of neonatal deaths resulted from low birth-weight ; about 40 per cent of newborn babies were underweight because of maternal depletion , chronic malnutrition and lack of proper antenatal care .  
These actions focused on the three key elements of learning , work and social security , and included a new employment insurance legislation ; measures to assist low income families with children ; programmes for youth geared to enhancing work opportunities ; and more flexible transfer payments to provinces to support the development of innovative social programmes .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
Recently , many developing countries have abandoned the policy of supporting industrialization by maintaining agricultural prices low across the board and left prices to be determined on the market , expecting that resources would thus be allocated efficiently and market opportunities would be exploited .  
In tandem with the premium that new permanent members will enjoy as incumbents , this low level of support required will virtually ensure the automatic extension of new permanent members , rendering a periodic review meaningless .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
An independent central bank not only ensures low and stable rates of inflation , but through its autonomy from governmental interference in monetary policy also contributes to a healthy division of power in the economic sphere .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Another attractive feature of the ARGOS system is the small transmitters : the average daily electric current required is as low as a few milliamperes ; miniaturized models can be as compact as a small matchbox , weighing as little as 20 grams .  
During the first half of the year , the region was receiving substantial private credit inflows on a net basis , continuing a trend that had started in 1996 owing to low international interest rates and improving growth prospects .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
Poverty was particularly severe on the African continent , which experienced a wide variety of epidemic and endemic diseases , a very low literacy rate , hunger and malnutrition and heavy external debt .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
The health of the ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
With regard to the question posed by the delegation of the United States , he wished to make it very clear that there were two aspects to the issue of the minimum age for recruitment and that they were inseparable : the current standard was too low and must be raised , but that should not prevent it from being applied .  
More contemporary national and international discussion of how to achieve a balanced approach to macroeconomic policy could be very valuable , focusing on how to simultaneously address economic and social goals , such as full employment , low inflation and development in the fullest sense , including both efficient economic growth and an effective strategy for increasing equity .  
The triumph of capitalism in the second half of the twentieth century was largely based on its ability to regain popular legitimacy via the intervention of government to ensure low levels of unemployment and more acceptable distributional outcomes capitalism with a human face .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In many developing countries , low levels of technological accumulation point to a need for an overhaul of the educational system in order to incorporate basic technical and business education which will serve as a basis for either on-the-job training by firms or formal industry-wide education .  
There has been a dramatic but uneven increase in the flow of private capital , particularly equity capital , to developing countries . 11 In order to alleviate the balance-of-payment and debt problems and to increase income , many developing countries have adopted investor friendly policies such as low or no corporate taxes , tax holidays , subsidies to investors , and privatization . 
The world economy was growing well below its potential , a large number of developing countries were stagnant or had a declining GDP , prices of many primary commodities were at unusually low levels , social conditions in crisis countries had suffered serious setbacks , and downside risks were substantial .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
A United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF ) nutrition survey , conducted in April and May , confirmed that overall nutritional standards in Bahr Al Ghazal had improved , but from a very low initial level : the average global malnutrition rate , in fact , was 22 per cent .  
A country improves its chances of success in the struggle to reduce poverty when it achieves strong , sustained economic growth which creates a substantial expansion in the number of high-productivity jobs ; when the incomes such growth generates are also helped by a policy aimed at defending their purchasing power through low inflation ; and when support also exists in the form of significant programmes of well focused public transfers .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
Two aspects of Internet accessibility were addressed by the Gateway initiative : ( a ) user-friendly Web design based on universal principles to facilitate access by users with physical or sensorial disabilities and ( b ) text-based and low-intensity graphical content to facilitate access by users with low levels of information technology or communications capacities ( bandwidth ) .  
The decline in the rate of growth of LDCs recorded since 1996 was not only attributable to austerity measures related to the implementation of economic reforms but also to declining trends in ODA , the low level of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and depressed commodity prices .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups . 
The economic weaknesses of small island developing States were well known : narrow economic base , low levels of diversification , heavy dependence on external trade ; shortage of skilled manpower ; and the brain drain .  
For instance , there may be concomitantly higher levels of street and ( low visibility ) intra-familial violence , large proportions of the population that are severely disadvantaged and young ( that is , in the age groups perpetrating and suffering crime ) , rapid migration into urban areas , lack of trust in law enforcement , inefficient justice systems , corruption , limited good governance and severe competition for scarce resources .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
This has now changed to a vicious circle of depressed exports which discouraged investment , and vice versa ; the depression spread over the region and dampened exports which , together with low consumption resulting from uncertain economic prospects decreased aggregate demand and discouraged investment for the future .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In the years to come , for economies with a relative average development , the subject of employment , which was included as a commitment in Copenhagen , will be essential to overcoming the link between poverty , low productivity and insufficient levels of skilled human capital .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
Our purpose is to improve the quality of life of average and low income earners and to encourage equitable distribution of goods and services in the economic and social sector without excluding the customary and traditional values observed by communities , and to integrate programmes and activities in a manageable manner to ensure that strong community participation , commitment and ownership in various development areas can and will continue to be sustained .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
The Committee notes the observation of the Secretary-General , in paragraph 63 of annex I to the tenth progress report , that remote connectivity to IMIS is preferred in view of the low investment involved compared to the alternative of the deployment of complex administrative applications to duty stations .  
He therefore rejected the notion that the permanent members of the Security Council had a special financial responsibility for the non-peacekeeping activities of the United Nations , as well as the idea that the low per capita income adjustment should not be applied to the permanent members of the Council or that a regular budget floor rate should be set for those States .  
Indeed , accelerated economic growth is also of paramount importance if Africa is to reverse its increasing marginalization as reflected by quantitative indicators , particularly its small share of world trade , the limited inflows of foreign direct investment , its heavy debt burden , the relatively low utilization of communication technology , the falling standard of education , the deteriorating health services and the declining food self-sufficiency ratio .  
The low gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which was essentially equivalent to that of 1958 , although the population had tripled in size since that time , the annual demographic growth rate having risen from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent ;  
In addition to the physical injury resulting from the battery , battering during pregnancy can result in premature labour , miscarriages , recurrent vaginal infections , delivery of premature or low _ birth-weight infants with reduced chances for survival , sexual dysfunction , fear of sex , and sexually transmitted diseases .  
This study revealed that the amount of support ordered by judges or agreed to by the parties is extremely low and that the whole range of tools offered by the law for ensuring that the amount is fair are underused ( for example , petitioning for interim support , approaching the grandparents when the amount paid by the father is insufficient and having support payments withheld by the employer of the liable party ) and that there is a tendency for the liable party to default on payments .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Those small sections not considered problematic with a low authorized post base in which a marginal number of vacancies would generate a vacancy rate in excess of the budgeted level .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
These setbacks can be attributed , inter alia , to a harsh natural environment , inadequate economic policies , recurring droughts and the low level of development of social sectors .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
Inadequate budgetary allocations for the social sectors , slow disbursement of available funds , weak institutional and human resources capacities , and unreasonably low salary levels for civil servants are constraints common to all sectors .  
Demands of labour mobility accompanying the growth of the market economy in some developing countries have created a transient internal population , with low and insecure wages and poor access to housing , medical care and schooling for their children .  
Such economic , social and development policy measures have proven taxing on the national budget of an economy burdened with reconstruction , low investment and real growth rates and high unemployment , as is always the case in a postconflict society .  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period , and with gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :

On the civil service level , it is often motivated by salaries so low and so infrequently paid that public servants are forced to choose between service to their country and meeting their families basic needs .  
In the light of low and unstable export earnings , limited access to private financial flows , small domestic savings and the serious debt problems experienced by these countries , ODA remains a critical source of their development finance .  
Three sets of factors can be proffered : the low savings base ( subsistence income levels ) ; weak institutional base for intermediation ( thin , fragile , fragmented financial system with limited financial instruments ) ; and decapitalization . 
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
The Committee is further concerned at the limited access of children with disabilities to formal or vocational educational opportunities and at the proportionally low number of girls attending primary or secondary school .  
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
For its part , it had initiated a systematic study of the effects of continuous low level exposure at the cellular , molecular and clinical levels on the health of the population in high natural background radiation areas in the state of Kerala .  
The Committee is similarly concerned by the different minimum legal ages for marriage , the absence of a defined minimum age of sexual consent for boys , the very high minimum age for consulting a doctor without parental consent and the extremely low minimum age of criminal responsibility - currently age seven .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .  
The Committee is further concerned at the low and decreasing number of trained health personnel , including mental health and social welfare professionals , which is contributing to the insufficient provision of essential services .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
Faced with the continuing low price of wool , the Department of Agriculture is endeavouring to encourage agricultural diversification , while programmes related to wool production and marketing continue to be a major focus , among them the Agricultural Subsistence and Incentive Scheme , designed to provide financial support and to assist in the improvement of existing farming operations or the development of new farm-based enterprises and the Pasture Improvement Programme .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
By 2005 , through a series of incremental steps , reach an overall target of annual expenditure on the epidemic of between US $ 7-billion and US $ 10-billion in low and middle-income countries and those countries experiencing or at risk of experiencing rapid expansion for prevention , care , treatment , support and mitigation of the impact of HIV / AIDS , and take measures to ensure that needed resources are made available , particularly from donor countries and also from national budgets , bearing in mind that resources of the most affected countries are seriously limited ;  
The humanitarian consequences of the increasingly difficult operating environment include : reduced ability to work with or access women ; inability to reach populations that are a low priority for the Taliban authorities ; and generally increased costs or difficulty in implementing assistance projects to the extent that otherwise viable projects have to be considered for closure . 
The obligation not to discriminate is an immediate duty and discrimination in access to food on the basis of race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status , as stated in article 2 , paragraph 2 , of the International Covenant , can not be justified under any circumstances , including low levels of resources .  
The Government considers the success of cooperative development is fully dependent on the ability of cooperatives to overcome difficulties , including : the power of local monopolies ; unpredictable legal , administrative , customs and taxation rules ; lack of professionalism in economic and administrative control ; low level of business discipline ; and corruption .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires , inter alia , a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of ODA ) , to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
The Committee has also recommended the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children , including disabled children , in order to monitor and evaluate the progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  7 .  In one of its concluding observations , the Committee noted that , while the incidence of disability among the child population was low , disabled children have been the victims of abandonment and discrimination .  
Lack of , or inadequate , laws and labour standards and the illegal or semi-legal nature of the work formed the basis for forced , servile and exploitative working conditions , which varied from humiliating treatment , low payment and extreme working hours , to bonded labour or forced labour .  
Addressing an informal meeting of the Working Group in New York on 14 September 2001 , the Commissioner-General of UNRWA said that , as in previous years , the Agency faced not only a budgetary deficit of $ 31-million , but also was concerned about a very low cash position which threatened the ability of UNRWA to meet its commitments in the remaining quarter of 2001 .  
In addition to these personal aids , the State also runs a scheme of building aids , which are intended for public contractors ( such as the low cost housing fund , the national society for low cost housing and the communes ) or private contractors ( such as non-profit making companies contributing to broader subsidized housing programmes ) .  
While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
At present the Israeli military aircraft are still continuing their provocative acts , which reached a dangerous level yesterday when , starting at 17.20 hours , 14 military aircraft at once overflew Lebanese cities and regions at low altitudes , causing anxiety and terror among Lebanese civilians , especially children , and terrifying large numbers of tourists who had come to spend the holiday period in Lebanon , owing to the repeated breaking of the sound barrier by those aircraft during the night-time hours . 
In his report an American military scholar concluded that the US military strategy in Iraq is based on a " flawed " logic because it is pursuing two mutually independent goals of changing Iraq 's regime and doing it " quickly and at a low cost . "  
UNCTAD indicated that the excessive dependence on foreign capital , rapidly rising foreign debts , the low and unstable prices of primary products , the continuous spread of HIV / AIDS , and unceasing civil wars are all important factors that hinder the continuous economic improvements of the least developed nations .  
We have been all the while upholding the rule of law , keeping an efficient and administration-oriented government as well as honest and competent civil servants .  We have continuously improved qualifications of our working population , promoted free enterprise and free trade , ensured the free flow of information , maintained a stable budget system and healthy financial mechanism , pursued a prudent public financial policy and implemented a simple and clear low rate of taxation .  
Caohai is in the area controlled by the subtropical monsoon .  Caohai basin has high elevation and low latitude with an average yearly temperature of 11.6 degrees Celsius and an average yearly sunshine of 1,801 hours .  It has become a " paradise for migratory birds " and an ideal summer resort for its mild winter and cool summer , combined with many advantages such as abundant water flow , fertile land , densely-knitted swamps , and rich biological resources .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
Shanxi province is located at the intersection of the Mid-west and the East , and is also an important national production base for coal and electricity commodities , is abounding in resources , with low labor costs and land prices , and possessing an industrial foundation abundant in economy and technology and a broad market .  
We should take resolute steps to reduce and eliminate a number of technically backward production capacities which have a high energy consumption and a low economic efficiency and which have caused serious environmental pollution ; and give priority to supporting the development of large enterprises and enterprise groups which have advanced equipment , well-marketable products , and a strong ability to develop new products .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
In view of the drop in people 's income expectations and the rise in their expenditure expectations , and their insufficient consumption capacity , we raised the standard of the basic living needs of workers laid off from state enterprises , the unemployed , those urban residents eligible for the lowest basic living needs , and others on low incomes , and increased the wages of workers of organs , undertakings , and units , and the pensions of retired personnel .  
In combination with economic restructuring , knocking out backward production capacity , and upgrading industry , last year the industrial front focused on reducing surplus production capacity in sectors such as textiles , coal , petrochemicals , and the metallurgical industry ; and the banks refused to lend money for products with high production costs , low standards , and lack of sales outlets , thus opening up a market space for superior enterprises and evening out some of the market supply and demand .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
The initial stage refers to the historical stage in which the situation of the impoverished population accounting for a large proportion and the people 's living standards being comparatively low will be gradually changed so that the entire people will become comparatively prosperous .  
Qiao Xiaoyang said : Tremendous achievements have been scored in our country 's legislation work , but some problems have also cropped up in practical legislative work as legislation progresses at an accelerated pace and the number of laws enacted multiplies , such as legislation in excess of legal power , conflict and contradiction between different laws , regulations , and rules , low legislative quality , and lack of democratic procedures in legislation .  
However , the capital city 's education still has many problems which urgently need to be resolved : there remains a prominent contradiction between the growing education needs of the masses of the people and education 's insufficient supply in quantitative terms and low quality ;  
This reporter has learned from the meeting that under the present circumstances wherein its economy still remains underdeveloped , China has succeeded , thanks to its hard efforts in recent years , in bringing an unduly fast population growth under effective control ; its total fertility rate among women of child-bearing age has dropped below the supersedure level ; and the country 's population reproduction mode has experienced a historical change to one of " low birthrate , low death rate , and low growth . "  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
On the one hand , after China joins the WTO , import tariffs will be cut by a wide margin and this will help domestic ship owners , shipyards , and designing units directly use advanced , reliable , and fairly-priced , and serviceable complete sets of foreign ship equipment and spare parts with low prices .  
The electronic business is to bring electronic technology to the overall trade activities , and has the characteristics of low operational costs , a wide spread of electronic service subscribers , no limit on time and space , and direct interaction and exchange between electronic service providers and subscribers .  In addition , the capacity to make warehouses , goods shelves , and stores virtual has reduced the intermediate links , which in turn greatly reduces trade cost and trade cycle .  
It should be pointed out that the noticeable difference between the developing countries and developed countries is that due to being exploited and controlled by colonialism and imperialism for a long time in the past and now being at a low level of economic development , the vast number of developing countries are bound to place their state sovereignty , survival rights , and development rights at priority positions .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
As the majority of our products are of intermediate or low standard , we have had to import core key products from abroad ( such as CPU , DSP for mobile telecommunications , and so on ) .  Moreover , our country 's integrated circuits industry has also lagged far behind the international standard in terms of its seal and package technology .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Ours is a huge country with very low starting point .  And with difficult tasks ahead , it would be very difficult for us to face with complex contradictions , to organize and guide hundreds and millions of people to plunge into fierce competition in the new century , to realize our grand goals , and to find a foothold for the Chinese nation if we do not have a large number of the " solid rock " leading cadres who are trusted and supported by the masses .  
At present , the world socialist movement has fallen to a low point in its development while profitable relationships are adjusted by deepening the reform .  Furthermore , with the infiltration and the influence of decadent ideas and culture , corruption and other ugly phenomena grow and creep within the Party .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
The main points of dialectic materialism and historic materialism are : The world is material , unified , and interactively linked , and change is developed from low to high , from simple to complex ;  
The State Council recently held a conference in Shanghai on reforming the basic medical insurance system and pharmaceutical and public health system for employees in cities and towns throughout the country .  At this conference , the State Council expressly set out its general objectives of " providing relatively excellent medical service at relatively low cost and trying to satisfy the broad number of the people and the masses needs for basic medical service .  
In order to realize this goal , we must conform to the requirements of " low level and wide coverage " and adhere to the principle of associating individual accounts with comprehensive coordination in society .  Employers and employees should share the expense for medical insurance at a reasonable rate .  On this basis , we must balance the rights and obligations of the insured , ensure the collection of premiums for medical insurance and probe for solutions to balance medical costs that exceed the maximum sum .  
" Go ! "  No sooner had the group leader issued an order in a low , deep voice than the " special combat " soldiers set out by crawling out of the green curtain of tall crops .  In the twinkling of an eye , they submerged in the lake .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
A pertinent expert of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that some difficulties and problems still existed in the agricultural and rural economic operations at present .  The comparatively conspicuous ones included the relatively great impacts of drought , plant diseases , and insect pests on crops , the continued low prices of most agricultural products , the relatively numerous difficulties confronting the development of township and town enterprises , and so on .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
Building up the foundation and devoting effort to implementation are a process of endless circles and spiral ascent , which require repeated effort and effort at repetition .  However , this repetition is not simply a mechanical repetition on a low level ; instead , it requires that we should - - along with the deepening of reform , development of the situation , and the real situation of the units - - continuously adapt ourselves to new issues , study new problems and resolve new contradictions .  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
On the one hand , when the Russian planes suddenly entered the defense zone , the aircraft carrier 's onboard could be subjected to electronic interference from the Russian fighters which made the target display indistinct ; on the other hand , personnel manning the radar could be overly negligent , overlook the suspicious target , did away with effective tracking and monitoring , which enabled the Russian planes to fly extremely low when coming near the aircraft carrier and entered the radar 's blind spot .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
The rapid development of modern aircraft-borne weapons systems ; the surface-to-air missile units which are capable of reaching high-precision hit rates , fast operational response , wide shooting ranges and multiple targets ; and the anti-aircraft artillery units have formed into an air defense system of crossing firepower at high , medium-high , and low altitudes .  
In the exercise of " continuous attacks by submarines against an enemy frigate formation " organized by the base in early November , commanders of the " Red " and the " Blue " sides carried out confrontations without giving advance notice on their operational intentions .  Strong winds and heavy storms happened to be ragging at the sea area where the drill was conducted .  Large sea waves and low visibility increased the difficulty of spotting the targets .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
At the same time , we clearly recognize that Tibetan socialism is built upon a unity of politics and religion and the ruins of feudal serfdom with a weak economic foundation , low starting points and late start-ups .  It has remained in bondage for thousands of years , and these things still interfere with economic growth and social development .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
Military exercises have been held without interruption .  What is different is that these military exercises have not been conducted in the areas sensitive to Taiwan and have been announced , as were before , by Beijing 's official authorities in a low key through the sensational Hong Kong media .  
Chen Shui-bian 's burning task at the moment is to find out , externally , a highly adaptable political medium who has a diversified attribute and a low and incorruptible political feature , just like the old Siew . In addition , Chen Shui-bian should continue to have Yuan-tseh Lee [ Li Yuan-che ] , a renowned scholar refusing to associate with officials of doubtful reputation , reinforce the consensus within the country .  After this , he will be able to launch an attack in the chess game .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
Such a mentality can easily create a nationalist sentiment , which the right-wing forces take advantage of to " guide according to circumstances . "  Given the social background that the Japanese economy has been stagnant for a long time and that the masses are in low spirits , they have incited a narrow nationalist sentiment under the banner of opposing " national self-maltreatment " and restoring national self-respect in a vain attempt to drag Japan into the morass of militarization again .  
As the aircraft had flown at a low altitude for a long time , the temperature had risen to as high as 50 degrees centigrade inside the cabin , where the crew had become rather tired , sweating all over .  Nevertheless , they were still tightly bending over the portholes , carefully looking at each and every object floating on the sea surface and waiting for a miracle to happen .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
All localities , in the light of local situations , should clearly set the objectives , focus on key tasks , and strive to achieve practical results .  We should not only decidedly wipe out criminal forces and pressure groups already uncovered , but also should expose criminal forces and pressure groups that have been lying low and have not been exposed and clamp down on them .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin listened in detail to the account given by President Wang Dazhong . With great interest , Jiang saw the digital television launching and receiving system and the special chips used for the system with China 's own intellectual property rights , the 500-meter-long high temperature superconductor material , biological material , and other products .  He also asked about the scientific research network for China 's education , application of low temperature heat reactors , and optical communications .  
The laser guns , deployed in fixed positions or installed on mobile vehicles , can effectively shoot down and destroy attacking ballistic missiles , high and low altitude supersonic cruise missiles , ultra high speed stealth planes , and military targets at sea .  
Thanks to all these efforts , batches after batches of high-end cadres with high educational backgrounds have been recruited into the military , and have gradually become a main force in the contingent of cadres of our army .  However , there still exists a wide gap between our army and foreign armies in the cultivation of high-quality talent .  For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
The cunning small plane continued to climb lower in altitude and tried to shake off our planes by flying at low altitude .  Deputy group chief Li therefore circled the small plane at a low altitude in order to prevent the small plane from " slipping through the net " and to avoid a midair collision .  
Right now , a considerable number of domestic enterprises are relatively low in standard .  Some of our enterprises carry out extensive management , while others are backward in technology and equipment .  Still others are weak in carrying out technical innovations .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
As revealed , the new model of antisatellite satellites that Russia 's new space force will be equipped with is two to three metric tons in weight and four to six meters in length and has an operational altitude of 5,000 km .  It can attack reconnaissance , navigational , and meteorological satellites deployed by an enemy in low Earth orbits as well as space planes .  
Russia will raise the quality of training for war preparations .  The two Chechen wars exposed the low level of the Russian military 's preparations for war and its lack of training and other problems .  Therefore , starting last year , the three services of Russia started to reform the military training system , increasing training time and frequency , expanding training scale , and fully utilizing modern high technology to improve the quality of training according to the requirements of the " Military Doctrine " and reform plan .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The difference is that combined operations are dominated by synergy of different arms based on a dominant arm , supplemented by the support among different services , so as to form an overall operational power within the systems of the arms .  They normally serve the purpose of achieving tactical objectives and the operational strength , means of command , and formats of operations are relatively unvaried and the degree of synergy is relatively low .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
Seen from the history of the international communist movement , our party experienced various high tides and low ebbs , favorable and unfavorable circumstances , successes and errors , and various twists and turns , and successfully withstood the stern tests of strong winds and waves , always standing firmly aloof as a mainstay in the torrents of history and successfully creating the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
We firmly believe , that under the leadership of the spirit of this fourth seminar held by the central committee on the work in Tibet , and through the united struggle of all levels of the region , both high and low , especially the united struggle of the broad mass of farmers and herders and of grass-roots cadres , we will certainly be able to accomplish the goals and tasks of the work of assisting the impoverished and of development during this new stage . 
In light of this situation , the office has pooled its backbone technical personnel .  After more than one year of hard work to overcome key problems , they have developed a new type of missile for military training .  Compared with regular missiles , these missiles for military training purpose are low in manufacturing cost .  They can be used several thousand times .  Therefore , they are highly welcomed by military units .  
The western provinces and regions have vast land , great market potential , rich resources , low labor costs , unique comparative advantages , and tremendous development potential .  
From the traditional point of view , Chinese products have the advantage of lower prices because of lower production costs .  Despite the fact that today the people have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance competitiveness by improving production quality and services and adding new features , the practice of increasing market share by exporting more low-priced products remains prevalent .  This has prevented Chinese products from ridding themselves of their " poor quality and low price " image .  Moreover , lowering the price often gives others an excuse to file anti-dumping lawsuits .  
An expert said that China 's steady economic growth was not easy at a time of worldwide economic slowdown .  He said China 's economy could maintain its great vitality because of the pull from stronger internal demand when external demand was low .  
A responsible official of the State Council Legislative Affairs Office told reporters : The situation on China 's population front has undergone major changes .  Stabilizing the low birth rate and improving the quality of the newborn population have become the primary mission of our population and family planning work .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
If the export growth rate for the second half of the year continues at the low level we saw in May - - or even lower , perhaps becoming negative growth - - industrial growth for the entire year will be hard pressed to reach 10% , while the GDP growth rate for the entire year may fall below the minimum target of 7% .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
For several days running , fishermen braved the sweltering heat and the choppy water alongside the unit 's officers and men .  Together they assembled , laid low waiting for the right opportunity , set off rapidly , and launched joint attacks , thereby honing their skills in carrying out joint attack , defense , and rescue operations at sea .  
It can move : it can carry special combat operations elements , exploit the cover of complex weather and climatic conditions , break through defenses at low and extra low altitude , and conduct destructive combat operations in the enemy 's rear .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
With high functional density , short lead time , low costs , and other special features , small satellites are extensively applied to mobile communications , resources exploration , forest conflagrations , flooding , and marine monitoring , and yield social and economic benefits , becoming an important industry for countries with advanced aerospace technology .  
Over the past 20-odd years , the Chinese Government has overcome various difficulties .  It has successfully transformed a contingent of leading cadres who were quite old and whose educational levels were quite low into another contingent of leading cadres who are " relatively young " and " knowledgeable . "  Immediately afterward , it has vigorously launched another round of reform in the systems governing cadres and personnel which aims to be more democratic in the process of hiring officials .  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .

In terms of technological structure , the low technological level is a grave defect of the non-public economy .  In the sections where the technological level plays a decisive role , such as the manufacturing section and the new economic section , the non-public enterprises are usually at an unfavorable position while competing with foreign enterprises .  
In spite of the extremely low probability of a release of nuclear radioactive substance from nuclear power stations and nuclear facilities , various countries are taking strict preventive and nuclear emergency measures to prevent the damage to and adverse effect on the environment and public if a serious nuclear accident should happen by any chance .  
To be sure , we are fully aware that China is a developing country with over 1.2 billion inhabitants , a weak economic base , a low per-capita output value , and imbalance between its different parts in their economic development standards .  Therefore , we have put forth an important strategy to promote the development of west China .  
This responsible person stressed that based on the high or low quality level of the military cadres selected from general high level universities , speaking in a definite sense , their level of quality impacts the entire level of military development and the success or failure of our undertaking .  
In the field of culture , the feudal ideology has not been eliminated , the capitalist decadent ideas and the unhealthy and corrupt tendencies within the party still exist , and the people 's educational level is low , which have seriously affected the process of China 's modernization .  
( 2 ) Such arenas and facilities as " patriotic education bases , " " science and technology education bases for teenagers , " and " moral education bases " named by the state and relevant provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal departments must be open to teenage students at low rates or , given attempts are vigorously made to create the conditions , for free .  
( 3 ) All other types of public cultural facilities - - museums , memorial halls , science and technology halls , cultural centers ( stations ) , sports arenas ( gymnasiums ) , theaters , workers ' cultural palaces ( clubs ) - - and enterprises and institutions , cultural and sports facilities affiliated with social group , and extracurricular education facilities must uphold the principle of public welfare , extend the hours opened to teenage students , and be open to teenage students for free or at low rates during festivals and holidays .  
The existing main problems are a low overall standard of product quality , a low ratio of up-to-standard products in a considerable number of categories , the persistent act of producing fake and shoddy products in defiance of repeated bans , and the poor work in supervising and regulating quality .  
Latest statistics show that the average price of rolled steel nationwide has increased sharply in the first half of the year , putting an end to the low prices that continued over the years .  The price is now at a reasonable level of 2,300 to 2,450 yuan per ton .  
The official responsible for the State Administration of Environmental Protection said that the main reason for the relatively low rate of key state enterprises fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements is the outstanding structural pollution in the state 's key enterprises , the difficulties in tackling pollution , depression in enterprise production , and a lack of capital .  
Various policies such as raising the export tax rebate rate , starting to collect interest taxes , promoting steady tax-expense reforms , and raising the income of low income urban residents , etc . , have resulted in significant increases in exports during the first half of the year and in the total retail value of consumables , effectively stimulating consumer demand .  
With the development of the socialist market economy and the deepening reform of the grain circulation system in our country , however , the traditional central grain reserves management system and operating mechanism obviously lagged behind , its functions were not separated from those of the government , its responsibilities were not clearly defined , and its other problems such as low efficiency and rigid management were conspicuous .  These problems adversely affected the security of grain reserves .  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
if they are not careful , they might even die in those strange places .  The factory owners also pointed out : Chen Shui-bian disregarded mainland China 's markets which are nearby and only separated by a narrow Taiwan Strait , where laborers are abundant , and where investment costs are low .  
The party Central Committee and the State Council have always paid close attention to this policy , cadres at various levels have worked hard to implement it , and the broad masses have actively responded to it .  As a result , tremendous achievements have been made in our country 's population and family-planning work ; the over-rapid growth of population has been brought under effective control , and our country 's birth rate has dropped to below the replacement level , joining the ranks of countries with low birth rates .  
Enterprises engaged in the manufacturing and circulation of pharmaceutical products must exert to improve their internal management .  In particular , they must do away with the practice of " iron rice bowl " and " everyone eating from the same big pot , " renounce administrative protection and improper methods of management , and win market shares by relying on their superior products , superior service and relatively low costs and prices .  
Jiang Chunyun said : Owing to the limitations of its social development level and its natural environment , the level of work in population and family planning as a whole is relatively low in the west , except for a few areas ; the types of population reproduction [ ren kou zai sheng chan lei xing ] are changing , and the average population growth rate is on the high side , but the quality of the population is on the low side .  
He said , viewed from the industry , state-owned enterprises depend heavily on the high international oil prices , the low interest rates of banks , the conversion of debts into shares , the relief of their social functions , and other measures at the macroeconomic level .  Internal factors at the microeconomic level , such as the lowering of the costs of enterprises , the improvement in quality , and the readjustment and optimization of structure are still insufficient .  
As for Chen Chao-min , the repeated charges are : The case of rape and murder of a young girl at the Operations Command of the Air Force and the case of stolen guns and ammunition at the Taoyuan base , both of which have involved wrong verdicts ; backstage deals for personnel appointments , incompetent leadership , low operational rate for second-generation fighter planes , exodus of pilots , and so on .  
When dwelling on the tasks facing flood prevention and drought control , Wang Shucheng emphasized that rapid economic development has set increasingly high demands on flood prevention and water resources protection .  However , the current flood prevention standards of major rivers remain low .  If we do not consider flood diversion methods , the dykes of major rivers can only resist the floods occuring once in 20 years , and small and medium-sized rivers can only resist minor floods and will be in flood when medium floods occur .  
The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .  
Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
Feasible and effective measures should be adopted according to the specific conditions of various areas and industries .  Priority should be given to the central and western regions of the country , the main grain producing areas , and areas where peasants ' income remain at a low level .  It is necessary to stop the downward tendency in peasants ' income as soon as possible .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
Agricultural development has changed from the resource constraint of the past to the dual constraint of resources and market ; problems such as irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low comprehensive returns on agriculture , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes are becoming more conspicuous by the day , and these set new and still higher demands on the development of agricultural science and technology .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
Since the beginning of winter , there have been six major snowfalls in the eastern and central parts of Inner Mongolia . The low temperatures and accumulated snow throughout an extensive scope have become disastrous to 1.6 million people in 31 banners and counties of five leagues in the autonomous region , and a large number of domestic animals have frozen to death .  
We must change the method of simply considering structural adjustment as increasing or decreasing the acreage of crops , and avoid the practice of developing low level and redundant production and the situation of " everyone has the same thing . "  We should pay attention to keeping local characteristics of agriculture and develop and expand " advantageous crops while making improvements in primary production " so as to let peasants gain maximum benefits in the course of structural adjustment .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .  
Ours is a big developing country with a population of nearly 1.3 billion , where the level of economic and social development and the people 's living standards are still rather low ; in such a situation , our country also has a tremendous demand potential and very vast market space .  
These included decent economic growth , moderate inflation , low employment , flexible labour market and tight discipline in the management of public finances .

" It is inappropriate and often misleading to describe the actual change in households ' well-being without taking into account the various welfare provisions by the Government including free-subsidised education service , low cost public housing , free medical care , retraining and other government subvented welfare services all of which contribute to improving the living standard of the disabled , the elderly , the single parents and the low income households , " the spokesman added . 
My Administration will work to preserve Hong Kong 's special characteristics - the rule of law ; open and accountable government ; prudent fiscal policies ; low and predictable taxes ; personal , social and economic freedoms , and a civil service that is efficient and honest .

" We have in place a business friendly environment , a prudent fiscal policy , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services .  
" All the favourable conditions in Hong Kong which have underpinned our robust development in the past , such as our prudent financial policy , low taxation , sound financial and banking regulation , first-rate infrastructural facilities are still there and unaffected by external factors . " 
Our attractions are manifold .  Among those most commonly cited are our superb physical infrastructure , our simple tax regime and low tax rates , our well developed financial support services and regulatory system , the rule of law and in general a very business-friendly environment .  
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
For some remote residential areas within these districts , located well away from major noise sources , the general background noise level may be comparatively low and hence noise generated from passing aircraft may become more audible .  
Mr Tsang said Hong Kong was still probably the freest economy in the world with no restrictions on capital flows , a stable and freely convertible currency , no restrictions on gold or silver trading , no duties payable on virtually all goods , no trade quotas , a low tax system , the rule of law and a fast unfettered flow of news and information .  
On the fixed penalty system for littering offences , the Steering Committee considered that the existing level of fine which , on average , was about $ 400 was too low to produce sufficient deterrent effect .  
More importantly , Hong Kong 's edge over the other East Asian economies has been underpinned by a host of other factors , such as a good quality labour force , a low and simple taxation system , a stable government , a corruption free society , an efficient transport and telecommunications infrastructure , sound legal and regulatory systems , free flow of information , and most important of all , a huge and rapidly growing hinterland just to the north of Hong Kong , " Mr Tsang said .  
" The Government 's position on the issue is self-evident on the relevant legislation we have on the statute books barring discrimination .  But we still prefer to carry our message forward by sticking to our proven low key approach , mainly through public education and administrative measures .  
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
Given the advanced development of forensic analysis , it is now possible to take a buccal swab ( being a non-intimate sample ) to obtain a buccal cell sample by wiping a swab along the inside of the cheek part of the mouth of a person which is sufficient for analysing the DNA profile of that person .  This method is quick , efficient and the degree of interference is low .  
Notwithstanding the fact that the Hong Kong economy operates with a relatively low gearing , as evidenced in the high savings rate , the extreme interest rate volatility translated into substantial falls in both stock and property prices and in extensive pain for the community as a whole , over and above the pain already being experienced through economic adjustment . 
The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the rule of law , efficient public administration , prudent fiscal policy , simple tax system with low tax rate , sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services , so as to preserve and wherever possible lift further Hong Kong 's competitive position in the world .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the smaller decline in consumer prices in October 1999 than in September was mainly attributable to dissipation of the effect of the 50% cut in the rates payable in the third quarter of this year .  Also relevant was a low base of comparison in the fourth quarter of last year , when a rates rebate was granted .  
Based on the approved EIA report undertaken by the consultants , given that the number of vehicle trips per day is low and the material transfer station is not close to the nearby residents , no adverse environmental impacts to the nearby residents are anticipated from the operation of the works area .  
The corner stones of Hong Kong 's success - the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field for business , a low and stable tax regime , a freely convertible currency , the free and unfettered flow of information , press and other freedoms - had been preserved and protected since reunification .  
Internally , the Government will maintain the bedrock of its economic and trade policies , viz low taxes , free trade , free flow of information and the rule of law .  Building on such fundamental principles , we will keep upgrading our hardware ( infrastructure ) and software ( human resources and institutional framework ) in the continuous strive to sharpen our competitive edge and make perfect our business environment .  
It was reported that the Liaison Office of the Central People 's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( " the Liaison Office " ) asked leaders of the local Catholic diocese to adopt a low key approach in handling activities in celebration of the Vatican 's canonisation on October 1 of 120 Catholic missionaries and their followers who had been killed in China a hundred years ago .  The diocese later disclosed also that some scheduled religious exchange activities with its Mainland counterparts had been put on hold , probably due to the said canonisation .

Yet the market lost momentum soon after , along with the slides in the US and Tokyo stock markets , the heavy plunge in telecom and technology shares worldwide , and also the setback in financial shares .  The Hang Seng Index fell back to a 17-month low of 12 583 on 23 March , before recovering slightly to stand at 12 761 at end-March 2001 , 15% lower than at end-2000 .  
However , the known approaches in defining poverty tend not to take account of the assets held by individuals , usually only reflects the position at one particular point in time and takes no account of intangible income derived from Government spending on key social services such as housing , health and education , welfare etc .  They therefore understate the economic effectiveness of these services in improving the situation of low income families .

These include free market policies ; a high degree of autonomy ; a highly efficient government , a legal system based on common law ; the low and simple tax regime ; a level playing field ; free and instant flow of information ; and protection of intellectual property rights .  
In the light of the above , and given our low and simple taxation system , and the competing demands for resources to fund worthwhile human and social development programmes in the years ahead , we , the Government in conjunction with the community , need to carefully examine the long term sustainability of our existing social security schemes .  
( c ) It is a well established principle of the Government to strive to maintain a business-friendly environment , including a robust legal system , a clean government , a simple taxation system with low tax rates , a level playing field and free trade .  It is meant to enable the business sector to give full play to its dynamism and advantages , and as a result drive the robust development of the Hong Kong economy .

( c ) whether the level of rents of the Cyberport offices is lower than that of the offices of comparable quality in private commercial buildings ; if so , whether the unfavourable tenancy position of the Cyberport offices is the reason for the Administration 's setting low rents to attract tenants ; whether they have assessed if such a measure will result in a competition for profits with the private sector and deal a blow to the rental market of private commercial offices ; and  
The favourable ratings given to the five most important factors - low and simple tax system ; political stability and security ; free flow of information ; rule of law and independent judiciary ; and corruption-free government - point to why Hong Kong remains the preferred location for regional operations in this region .

He urged corporations in both the public and private sectors to actively consider issuing bonds as a means for raising capital in light of the current market environment of record low bank deposit rates and uncertain equity market .  
While the differential treatment for child allowance between the first two children and the third to ninth child is unlikely to have a significant impact on the decision of a couple regarding the size of their family , the differential may not be appropriate in the light of our very low fertility rate and has been removed as from the current financial year .

Summer is the time for this seasonal fruit . Markets and fruit peddlers ' carts are piled up with fresh pineapples delivered to the towns from the growing districts . The unique fragrance of pineapples carries afar . Their bright yellow meat is sweet and juicy , their prices low .  
The most intensive care must be taken from the time the baby takes solid food to the day the first school-year begins . Mothers must be very careful about choosing diets for their babies , with stress on high protein , low fat and digestibility . The daily menu should include steamed blended eggs , such meats as tender roast beef , liver , chicken , duck and fish as well as milk and fruit , in addition to indispensable nutriments like calcium tablets , cod liver oil and multi-vitamins .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
Though the advent of free markets is supposed to have brought improvements in amounts of goods for sale and improved service , the shabby stalls , aged vendors and lack of variety in commodities gave mute evidence of weak purchasing power , low consumption standards , and general poverty .

Many children of upper level cadres were admitted despite their low academic standards , while many outstanding students were rejected . Because my father had run a textile business before the Communists gained power , I was naturally considered part of the capitalist class .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
Extremely well suited to fresh water cultivation , Taiwan boasts one hundred such farms . A stable , warm and humid climate is available on Taiwan , as are over 40,000 fish and irrigation ponds throughout the island which are suitable for raising the fresh water mussel ( anodonta woodiana ) . Initial investment is minimal as mussels are cheap , food costs are low and little sophisticated equipment is necessary .  
At a time when foreign currency reserves were low , the purchase of U . S . $ 2,000 worth of fruit trees seemed wasteful . Chiang Ching-kuo reassured Sung that money spent on scientific research was never a waste .  
Many importing countries , strapped by foreign debt , pay particularly close attention to the terms and amount proposed by bidders . In 1979 the ROC government established the Export-Import Bank to assist local makers , granting long-term repayment schedules at low interest rates .

His singing voice must be pure and clean , and his speaking voice low and measured . His movements and gestures must be restrained and steady , what actors call " on the up-and-up . "  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
The sound of the waking clappers is actually very low , which the ordinary people generally can not hear as they sleep . The monks are tranquil and quiet in body and mind ; to them , even a falling twig can be heard , not to mention the clappers .  
One type of entertainment we discovered back then - - which had both aural and visual appeal - - was watching the quilt man fluff up the cotton for the inside of quilts . Tbe big quilt-beating bow suspended from his back and the wooden mallet he held in his hand made a low , reverberating noise that at times rang out sharp and clear . The sound had a natural rise and fall to it , a complex yet orderly melody that was quite pleasant to hear .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
During their first winter they discovered that the mountain , situated some 2,000 meters above sea level , had at least 1,000 hours a year of temperatures below seven degrees centigrade , making it a rare region of low temperatures in semitropical Taiwan and highly suited for growing temperate-zone crops . "  
Attempts were made by the first director to restore the interior to its former splendour . He had seen what Victoria 's workmen had removed and was given permission by the queen to select items from the boxes in which they lay and begin returning them to the Pavilion . Yet it was an uphill struggle and by the years of World War , after such a long period of public use , which included it being used as a hospital for Indian soldiers during World War , the once splendid building had hit a new low point .  
Despite the low completion rate for advance sales of new housing , the fact that the land was often bought at a time when prices were booming , together with high advertising costs , have meant that construction companies have only limited capacity to absorb the development costs themselves . From the consumer 's point of view , buying in advance and paying as the building nears completion offers an excellent way for salary earners to pay by instalment . Thus prices have only fallen by a meager 10-20% .  
Craftsmen have traditionally been held in low regard in Chinese society , but by dint of devotion to his calling and the artistry of his work Li has frequented the doors of the rich and famous and been treated on an equal footing by the powerful and elite . He has his own ideas on the subject .  
Those who finished high in the number of interpellations expressed satisfaction that their daily diligence at pursuing public policy is finally laid out for the public . Others are busy trying to defend themselves , patiently explaining to reporters why their numbers of interpellations are so low , or so biased in content toward a single side .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
The pay for a general civil servant is divided into " base salary " and " supplementary salary . " It differs according to rating and position . Ratings , from low to high , go from designated rank to recommended rank to selected rank , with the lowest being designated rank-1 and the highest selected rank-14 ( equivalent to an office director ) .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 . Not only did that familiar image of the family grouped around the radio set vanish , but one researcher at the time even found that many interviewees were unable to help with his survey for the simple reason that they never listened to radio at all .  
A schoolmate of mine who was put in a class for gifted students and then ranked low on several tests began to doubt her abilities , which she had always been praised for . She lost all her self - esteem , tested poorly into high school and later even dropped out . She changed completely for the worse . She became antisocial and terribly defensive , " she relates sadly . "  
Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
Of course this is related to our fitting in with Malaysian national policy - - to develop the east coast and to develop agriculture , " says Lin , explaining their " good luck . " Although Malaysia is an agricultural country , it only has palm oil and rubber as relatively well developed cash crops . They rely on imports for most other agricultural products like fruit , rice , and vegetables . Production of aquatic products is also low , so that agriculture has always been one of the sectors with investment incentives .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
Yang Ming-chao says , " Our environment is getting worse day by day . The river water and soil are enduring heavy pollution . The standard of living is low , and we are cut off from the outside . Our public works are backward , and no one is willing to come and invest .  
We rested on a platform that seemed to overlook the whole planet . The settlement was visible far away at the mountain 's foot , girdled by a white stream flowing in a bow-shape to its left before meandering off into the west to shake hands with a row of low clouds .  
In accordance with an assessment made by China Engineering Consultants , the Yushan National Park Administration decided that the land was unstable and liable to frequently collapse along the 50 odd kilometers of the planned cross-island route from Yuli to Tafen . The maintenance costs , they determined , were high and the economic value low .  
Moreover , products mined or gathered using explosives , drilling and digging have more fissures , the colors are not uniform and the quality is low , so the prices are also inferior . Besides , most of the rock gets smashed and lost , so that only ten or twenty percent is actually worth keeping .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
Because Ilan is at a low altitude and has many springs , the roots find it easy to quench their thirst and the trees ' crowns grow lush and full . Full of springs and developed by man relatively late , the areas where the mountains meet the plain have most of the remaining banyans .  
Because people have greater contact with the outside world and easy access to information and because everyone , particularly the middle class , is paying increasing attention to quality of life , when people see that consumer goods in Taiwan are of low quality and high price , they seek happier shopping grounds abroad . This is one method of obtaining more reasonable consumer quality .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
Taiwan 's history is not all centered on the Western plains . The aboriginal peoples have been living here for thousands of years . " He says that human activity in Taiwan has a vertical distribution from ancient to modern times and from high to low . Even the highest mountains show traces of human presence .  
A splendid photo opThe most plentiful species was the Japanese White-eye ; between 20 and 30 of them played in the tree . They self-assuredly pecked fruit , heads held high or dipped low , not even frightened away by the sound of a car door opening and closing under the tree or the rumble of an engine .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
From the international perspective , the global economy has been dragging along at a low ebb for some years now . There have been many reports of layoffs , salary cuts , and plant closings , even for established multinational giants . It was only in the middle of 1994 that light showed at the end of the tunnel , and the turnaround that is making everyone so pleased only really began then .  
For instance , the tall and lanky General Hsieh whirls like a white crane spreading its wings opposite the short and stocky General Fan , who squats low and makes monkey-style kungfu movements . " Each of the dancers has a different character , and there is a dialogue between them , " says Chen Li-e , going on to explain that the generals ' movements and positions can be varied flexibly depending on the size of the space in which they perform .  
But in hunting and fishing society with its low productivity , faced with the harsh realities of nature and a lack of material resources , people gradually extended the range of resources they could use . For instance , the Oroqen people of northeast China once had a taboo against eating bears and tigers , but gradually came to eat bear meat and use bear skins for clothing . But a people which faces the constant threat of death and hunger both needs animals and fears them , and this has given rise to many hunters ' taboos .  
The places to which they have scattered are unusual , as well . Some live high up at the Sun Yat-sen Hall atop Yangming Mountain , and some live down low near Keelung Harbor . Some can be found in tightly guarded army ammunition factories , and in nuclear power plants . Several generations of students and teachers meet to have fun together , and everybody feels as close as one big family .  
When cooking , the meat is first scalded in hot water and then immediately placed into cold water to cool it down , then slowly simmered over a low heat with a sachet of seasonings . Beef cooked in a clear broth in this way will be chewy and flavorsome , while the broth has a fresh meaty taste and there is no need at all to add MSG .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
There are no strict requirements for the registration of the dog population , so the rate of stray dogs being picked up by owners is low . City and County animal shelters are also extremely lacking . Even private organizations are overwhelmed . For instance , the Stray Animal Home , which can shelter 300 animals , was packed to overflowing less than three months after it opened .  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
The definition of porcelain is still a matter of some dispute , but in China the usual distinguishing criteria are that porcelain is fired from china clay at high temperatures over 1200 ( earthenware is fired at around 700-800 , or sometimes up to 1000 ) ; its surface is vitrified by the high kiln temperature ( earthenware may be unglazed or sealed by a low-temperature glaze ) ; and its body is pure white in color , is translucent , has low porosity , and rings brightly when tapped .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
In the boundless expanse of flat paddy fields , a thick wall of greenery , behind which one glimpses a home with green trees , a blue sky , grey tiles , a low red brick wall around , and whitewashed walls . Following the winding path which twists its way along the low banks between the fields , the front door comes into view .  
The Huayu Foundation has held seven classics courses for children . Every time the kids come to class , they must first put on dark blue robes and bow in front of a statue of the great sage Confucius . Then , while sitting cross-legged at low tables , the class recites fluently in loud and clear voices from the works of the Song dynasty Confucian scholar Zhang Zai , " I set myself to understand the ways of Heaven and Earth , and to bring peace and stability to the people .  
Later , during the Wei and Chin dynasties , and during the period of the division of the country into north and south , the " nine official ranks system " was adopted , further consolidating the feudal system . It was said that " No poor families could attain high rank , and no wealthy families would be given low rank . "  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
Seed boxes recreate the natural environment with artificial day and night and corresponding temperature changes , after which " winter " arrives , and the seeds are stored at low temperatures . The process can not be hurried , and it demands far more patience of the silviculturists than propagating the Taiwan red cypress or Taiwan cypress , whose seeds ' dormancy can be broken in a week or two given adequate water and light .  
New Zealand is large and sparsely populated , and seems much like a paradise . I remember when I went to Auckland ten years ago , life was relaxed and orderly , prices were low , and there were lovely boutiques all over the city . Outside the cities was an endless expanse of meadows and trees . I felt only that God had made a beautiful place at the tip of the world , and that New Zealanders were very lucky .  
My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
Guatemala is more than 108,800 square kilometers in area . The land is high in the south but low in the north . Guatemala City , located in the middle of the country , stands at an elevation of 1,500 meters above sea level . Its climate is cool , almost as if it were naturally air-conditioned .  
The southern Taiwan sun beats down on the low , densely packed buildings of Er-kung New Village , a military dependents ' community in Tainan County . In the morning market , the crowds seem to boil . In contrast , the expansive grounds of Our Lady of the Assumption Church , located in the center of the village , seem particularly cool and serene .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Southeast Asia and the mainland entice firms with their low production costs and their market potential . In addition , about 70% of the economic strength of the region is concentrated in the hands of Chinese business people who , in turn , are closely tied to Taiwanese business people . This drew many Taiwanese to the region more than 10 years ago , making them some of Southeast Asia 's earliest foreign investors .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
Taiwanese has survived only because people of Fujianese ancestry are the majority in Taiwan . However , though policies designed to suppress the use of all dialects ( such as fining or hanging humiliating placards on students who spoke dialect in school , or restricting time dedicated to programming in local dialects as did the broadcasting law promulgated in 1976 ) the impression was deepened that Taiwanese was relatively crude-a " low class " language that , though perhaps more intimate , was not suitable for elegant situations .  
A new 42-move form was established for the Asian Games , with contestants being judged on their facility in the form , including points such as whether a leg is raised high enough or if movements performed from a low squat are executed with sufficient power . The competitive element has attracted many young people to taijiquan , but has also provoked controversy within martial arts circles .  
Competitors were judged according to very rigorous standards . The head had to be kept centered , shoulders low , elbows down , arms loose , fingers extended , the breath drawn from the abdomen rather than the chest , etc . To aid in judging the skills of the competitors , the rules put special emphasis on large , sweeping moves . In addition to leg lift , fist form , step form , palm form , fluidity , and coordination , the competitors were also judged on style and rhythm .  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Filling the open spaces around the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung , and crowded onto nearby rooftops , some 20,000 spectators , including over 200 local and international journalists , were waiting for the action-an enormous number given the usual low attendance at art events .  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
Moving further into the garden , you find a motorcyclist popping a wheelie across the lawn , a sprinter racing over the low hurdles , a high jumper doing the Fosbury flop , and other athletes doing stretches , gymnastic routines with hula hoops , etc . All these works are part of the Living World Series . Each life-sized athlete is made of painted bronze cast upon a mold formed from an original work made of tightly bound sponge .  
The Nankang Hills stretch across the Taipei Basin as a straight finger of low sandstone peaks 140-370 meters high . Their highly uneven topography , carved out by the abundant local rainfall , has meant that despite lying cheek by jowl with the city , they have been spared destructive overdevelopment and have been able to maintain a basic forest environment . The hills ' great diversity of microenvironments creates a paradise for ferns .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
The appeal of a divine being that loves all mankind did n't find a ready audience in Chinese who still had their original brush with the West-looking down the barrel of a gun-fresh in their memories ; people were suspicous of the relationship between Christian doctrine and economic interests ; and they got life-saving medicine side-by-side with life-destroying opium . People were not well educated and standards of living were low , so there was fear and prejudice against foreign culture .  
What is more , ST &amp; T 's energy controller has many advanced functions , such as automatic readings and an " intelligent electric meter . " Users can set a monthly energy usage limit that will trigger an alarm when exceeded . Or it can be programmed to remind you that energy appliances such as dryers are best used when the rates are low at night . The user can even install intelligent modules on separate electrical devices and conveniently and precisely control the energy use of each .  
" As far as the explosive power of volcanoes goes , the lava eruption was much more moderate , " says Tsao Shuh-jong , section chief of the Division of Original Geology in the Central Geological Survey . In addition , basaltic lava has a relatively low silicon dioxide content , so it is correspondingly less sticky . Flowing basalt thus forms very different shapes from the lava of a typical volcanic eruption .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
One of these university freshmen had a camera , and on the summit he suddenly had a flash of inspiration to combine the majesty of nature with a portrait of the liberated human body . He asked his buddy to pose nude , with his head bent and body leaning at an angle . To get the image he desired , the photographer crouched low .  
As well as the high incidence of oral clefts , the number of children born with craniofacial deformities in Vietnam is also very high . Clinicians believe this is related to factors such as environmental pollution caused by the use of chemical agents during the Vietnam War , and the low standard of living which means that most pregnant mothers are poorly nourished .  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees . Even if high-quality products are raised , in light of the multiple layers of exploitation existing throughout the sales system and the dumping of low-priced products on the market , farmers are frequently unable to earn a profit .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
On some tours , as well as birdwatching and learning about coastal plants , tourists also ride out to the tidal zones to see how oysters are raised and collected . At low tide , they enjoy the sight of crabs digging their holes , and visit ponds where hard clams are grown . Later , as the tide rises , they return to the shore to enjoy magnificent views of the sea over the now-submerged oyster beds .  
This long-standing practice of raising tilapia with other livestock kept tilapia prices low , though its bacterial counts were somewhat elevated . Tilapia makes a delicious dish commonly consumed at family meals , but its strong earthy taste and humble image can not be shaken off .  
The owner of a Japanese-style house was fined NT $ 50,000 for " over-pruning " a tree . This fine was reportedly low , as the Department of Cultural Affairs took into consideration that the tree was only trimmed in response to neighbors ' concerns that in summer mosquitoes would thrive in its dense leaves . The law 's lowest fine was levied , with the warning that a second violation would be punished with the heaviest fine , NT $ 100,000 . However , the owner was very unimpressed .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
Before the morning dew on the pink petals of the mountain rambling roses has evaporated , and as the flowers ' soft , subtle fragrance arrests the steps of the passer-by , suddenly the sound of helicopter blades gets closer . Those on the ground directing the work shout to the others immediately to vacate the drop zone and get down as low to the ground as possible .  
The low temperatures make it tough for the workers to go on but if a typhoon should strike the high mountains , with their ubiquitous steep cliffs , the men are petrified . In 2003 Huang Chao-ying won the contracts to rebuild the Hsuehpei and Sumita shelters , located along the Shengleng trail . Work began at the end of August and in September two typhoons hit . " On hearing the news warning of the typhoon , everyone left .  
This lowered his morale . Due to these frustrations , there was a time when Wang considered giving up . But then he considered his original vow to help , and also how he himself had had discipline problems in school : fighting , bullying , low grades . The affirmation and care he received then from his church elders guided him out .  
Boosted by record low interest rates since the beginning of the year , an atmosphere of optimism surrounds the real estate market throughout Taiwan . Offers ranging from upmarket homes in Taipei City , to townhouses in central and southern Taiwan with ads touting 100% financing , have stirred awake many people 's long-silent itch to buy .  
With this , the owner finally relented and parted with his beloved gramophone . In 1998 , while in India , Lin discovered a 1921 British-made large-horned two-track stereophonic gramophone . This machine utilized one phonographic needle to feed two separate acoustic pickups featuring diaphragms of different thickness to produce high and low notes . This was one of the earliest two-track stereo systems .  
Chang specifically targeted seasoned pedagogues who were at or close to retirement age , reasoning that it would be the best way to attract true lovers of the teaching profession . Such individuals would be teaching primarily for the sheer pleasure of it rather than merely for profit . The teachers ' essentially altruistic persuasion along with their experience and dedication would combine to create an academic atmosphere high in quality but low in expense .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
The third is temporary interest-reduction bonds , where interest rates start from a very low level and rise over several years , followed by payment of a variable interest rate calculated as a floating international base rate plus a fixed margin .  
If the probability of late effects is proportional to effective dose at low doses , which is probably the case , the collective effective dose is an indicator of the total attributable harm to be expected in that group and its descendants .  
For example , in Malawi a low - cost operation based on voluntary contributions and the involvement of the international community in Malawi and the region also allowed broad geographical and chronological coverage of the electoral process .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , was not yet sufficiently understood .  
In contrast , in many African countries the humanitarian crises manifest a low point in a continuing process of structural deterioration compounded by internal conflict or externally induced destabilization .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , is not yet sufficiently understood .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
Given the low level of voluntary contributions , it would also be desirable to prioritize training programmes based on their comparative advantage and to develop high quality programmes in cooperation with relevant national and other institutions .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
The aim of a comprehensive financial reform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale , reflective of Members ' real capacity to pay , automatically adaptable to changed national circumstances and giving consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita incomes .  
As I have stated , not only is it not true that a majority of the people voted for continued or enhanced territorial status , not only did fewer than half of the eligible voters vote at all , but because of the low percentage , the referendum , on its own legal terms , was invalid .  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
Economic development and increasing per capita incomes in rural areas may be expected to be accompanied by substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels not only in modernized agriculture and transportation but also in households , especially if prices in real terms remain as low as in recent years .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
Access to credit by small rural or urban producers , landless farmers and other people with low or no income should be substantially improved , with special attention to the needs of women , and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups by :  
Many non-governmental organizations feel that progress could be faster , pointing to continued forest damage and the apparently low levels of grass-roots involvement , and calling for the implementation of the FAO Peasants Charter to correct skewed land ownership or access patterns , which concentrate human pressure on the few forests that are accessible to the poor , thereby contributing to their degradation and loss .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Despite the success in providing compulsory primary education for girls and boys under adverse conditions , the quality of the education system and educational achievement are not satisfactory because of overcrowded schools , double shifts at the elementary level , lack of maintenance , inadequate teacher training , lack of educational material and low salaries . 
The latter 's objective is to enable people with low incomes in the Appalachian region successfully to enter the economic mainstream by , inter alia , organizing cooperative ventures among small firms to produce for niche markets , mobilizing financial resources on behalf of the region from outside , creating learning clusters in conjunction with other communities in the country , providing transitional support for people moving from welfare to work , and developing production and leadership skills .  
They noted the general satisfaction expressed by the Inspectors with competitive recruitment examinations , but wished to seek clarification from them regarding the apparent contradiction in paragraphs 65 , 67 , 78 and 79 of the report , which stated , on the one hand , that the quality of staff members recruited through examinations had improved and , on the other , that the general level of candidates was rather low .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
The Committee was informed that as a result of the reduction in the number of leased armoured personnel carriers in UNAMIR ( see para . 38 above ) and the anticipated low use of those vehicles , the revised cost estimates for the period from 10 December 1994 to 9 June 1995 should be reduced ( a ) by $ 649,900 under spare parts , repairs and maintenance and ( b ) by $ 317,000 under petrol , oil and lubricants .  
During the work on the new arrangement and the present draft resolution , which will be adopted today , one Member State , regrettably , expressed low tolerance for the legitimate interests of Croatia , a Member State , and instead directed efforts into forms of short-term political pragmatism , at the expense of legal and operative logic of the relevant United Nations documents .  
In addition , UNDP and the Government of France co-sponsored an international workshop in September entitled : " Implementation of Decentralized Rural Electrification Programmes Within A Sustainable Development Perspective " which identified viable low carbon paths to economic and social development that can be supported by the GEF .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
At 1305 hours on 11 January 1995 hostile aircraft flying at low altitudes broke the sound barrier over the complex belonging to the State Establishment for the Petrochemical Industries in Basra Governorate , the strong shock waves produced causing physical damage and the breakdown of some items of equipment and machinery .  
The economy is dual and is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with a high purchasing power but almost strictly dependent on imports .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;

NULLWhile it is true that a high rate of investment is not by itself sufficient to bring about sustained development , no developing country has achieved sustainable , vigorous economic development with low rates of investment .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
In the end , the design concept involved the elements of a vertical city in the park ( a tall rectangular slab ) and an integrated civic centre ( composed of the slab , a low General Assembly building and a horizontal link , the Conference building ) .  
As a result of the sanctions , it has become increasingly difficult to satisfy minimum existential needs , especially in the case of the unemployed , the employed with low income and family income below a social minimum , pensioners with low pensions and family incomes , families with children , elderly rural households , etc .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
It noted that rural economic production was increasing from a very low base and that self-sufficiency in food production is achievable provided additional inputs to existing programmes are made available .  
40 Given the typical characteristics of rural areas , such as sparseness of population , lack of trained personnel , low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services , it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
The symposium identified the main reasons for the lack of a systematic strategy for the provision of comprehensive health care in refugee situations : the low priority accorded to it by organizations specialized in emergency response ; insufficient field staff with appropriate training ; limited funding and resource allocation ; insufficient coordination among national authorities , non-governmental organizations and United Nations organizations and agencies in the country of asylum ; and consideration of family planning as a sensitive issue in post-conflict situations without seeking the views and support of refugee women .  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency . 
Human activities that can contribute to forest decline include pollutant depositions , overgrazing when woodlands are used for pastoral purposes , insensitive harvesting operations , the use of plantations with low genetic diversity , the accidental introduction of pest species , fire , the alteration of hydrology and , finally , the anticipated climate change associated with the burning of fossil fuels and increased concentration of greenhouse gases .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
On 13 July 1995 , aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " penetrated over Cuban territorial waters north of our capital , entered prohibited zone MU-P1 and overflew over the city at very low altitude , dropping leaflets and behaving in a dangerous and careless manner .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
In addition , prenatal exposure to illicit drugs and factors such as premature birth , low birth weight and poor relations between the child and care-giver in early childhood have been identified as problematic in relation to later development and , consequently , as precursors of the risk factors listed in the table above .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
The observed trend of a larger increase in minimum than in maximum temperatures is apparently linked to associated increases in low clouds and aerosols and to the enhanced greenhouse effect .  
Additionally , urgent social and economic priorities and severe capital constraints lead to low policy priority for any specific and additional mitigation or adaptation measures .  
Many poverty-stricken low latitude countries with rapid population growth , high illiteracy and large deficiencies in terms of trained manpower suffer from a complex water scarcity , in the form of particularly problematic environmental conditions with which they must cope , such as monsoon climates , erratic rainfall and poor soils . 
In summary they are those whose ownership of assets or access to productive resources and whose capacity to participate in new opportunities is so low as to make it difficult for them to have the basic minimum of consumption and services required for a decent life .  
The low national saving levels characteristic of the region 's economies , and the limited volume of investment resulting from such savings , will only allow them to grow at moderate rates ; therefore , unless savings and capital formation increase significantly , an accelerated economic growth rate can not be achieved .  
In view of the low level of contributions registered during the past biennium , the Board emphasized the Institute 's urgent need to make an active and strong fund-raising effort , to ensure an adequate flow of contributions to its Trust Fund .  
Among them were the following : their removed location from sources of information and special components ; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements ; the lack of qualified suppliers , which resulted in more expensive in-house process development ; and a less efficient country infrastructure .  
The unsatisfactory housing situation was attributed to a number of constraints , including the lack of a national housing policy and implementation strategy reflecting current and prospective economic realities , inadequate delivery of land for housing , the lack of financial mechanisms that cater to the needs of the low - and middle-income groups , and high construction costs in relation to incomes .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Maintenance of " old habits " is reinforced , in addition to spiritual and cultural traditions , through a low level of social and geographical mobility , strong social control exerted by communities and - paradoxically - the socialist system enforcing uniformity in society .  
Mainly because of the prevailing low rates of both public and private saving , lack of competitivity in international trade and some ill-adapted economic policies , African countries did not succeed in mobilizing the aggregated $ 82.5-billion that were to come from Member States to support the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development over the period from 1986 to 1991 .  
Two recent assessments for industrialized countries have included specified functions such as recreation , conservation , protection , hunting and grazing , and for each have shown the total forest area broken down into importance classes - high , medium and low .  It has also given a verbal account of " hot " political issues .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
The general population 's lack of income-earning opportunities and low purchasing power , combined with increasing prices and decreased availability of basic goods on local markets , have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
Given that Mozambique takes off from an extremely low economic base and after factoring in population increases , the prevalence of the recent trend of lacklustre growth performance would translate into GDP per capita increases too modest to make a visible contribution to , and to sustain , the goals of poverty reduction , social sector development , reconstruction and restoration of external viability .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
His delegation shared the belief that the programme resource requirements for operational activities for development should be granted due priority and supported the idea that the system resources previously allocated to outdated and low priority programmes should be reallocated to economic development with an emphasis on realistic project evaluation , strict performance compliance and strengthened oversight and investigation capabilities to preempt fraud and the mismanagement of the dwindling resources of the Organization .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
For example , in trade policy , when a low uniform tariff rate is applied to all products , any extra amount spent on luxury goods deprives the industrial sector of scarce foreign exchange .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
Consequent to the low tariff rates , imports had increased while economic development and exports had been circumscribed by , in addition to other causes , exogenous factors including the restrictive policy of other countries coupled with the sluggish and diminished flow of both private and official funds .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings due to low disposal incomes .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
The privatization of the economy is being completed , the level of inflation has been steadily low , the national currency is stable and liquid , and for the first time in a little more than five years of independence we have registered economic growth . 
The Task Force on Employment and Sustainable Livelihoods conducted one review in a country where poverty eradication was the primary focus in a setting of low economic growth and rapid labour force expansion ; in another country , the main concern was how to move from structural adjustment to growth with equity ; in another , the review focused on the employment aspects associated with a shift from a planned to a market-oriented economy .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Important issues highlighted by the participants for consideration in cadastral surveying and land management included the recognition that the success of a cadastral system was dependent not only on its legal or technical sophistication , but also on whether it protected land rights adequately , and permitted those rights to be recorded ( when appropriate ) efficiently , simply , quickly , securely and at low cost .  
The Committee was concerned about the low level of occupational achievement by educated women and male dominance in technical and professional fields , on the one hand , and the concentration of women in the lower-paid service sector , in particular the tourist industry , on the other .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
Djibouti has a dual economy that is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and secondly , by a modern economy , based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with high purchasing power but one that depends almost entirely on imports .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
It was therefore disturbing to note that the average level of ODA as a proportion of the gross national product ( GNP ) of developed countries had fallen in 1996 to a record low of 0.25 per cent .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
Moreover , the Agencys working capital reserves representing the difference between assets and liabilities in the regular budget had been driven to a dangerously low level , so that at the end of 1996 , they amounted only to some $ 5 million , or the equivalent of less than one weeks share of the Agencys normal monthly expenditures of $ 22-million .  
The proportion of endemic villages having access to safe water was still quite low , however , and only half of the villages possessed water filters in good condition , the treatment of surface water did not include all endemic areas , the supervision of community-level agents was inadequate and the information to lower levels insufficient .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
His delegation supported the recommendations contained in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the report concerning the continuing relevance and importance of the principle of a low per capita income adjustment , and it agreed to the Committee 's proposal that the future scale of assessments should be based on gross national product .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
This has not been effective , however , in raising growth the extra liquidity created by low interest rates has not been channelled into real domestic economic activities , but has sought higher yields in other countries .  
A typical user terminal , operating at an uplink bit rate of between 128 and 768 Kbps , would employ a small-aperture antenna with a diameter of 66 cm and a solid-state power amplifier ( SSPA ) of 1-3 W . All radio frequency components ( SSPA , low noise amplifier , and up / down-converters ) would be integrated into a small outdoor unit mounted on the reflector . 
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Those included : exposures from natural sources of radiation ; exposures from man-made sources of radiation ; medical radiation exposures ; occupational radiation exposures ; dose assessment methodologies ; epidemiological evaluation of radiation-induced cancer ; deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair and mutagenesis ; hereditary effects of radiation ; combined effects of radiation and other agents ; models , mechanisms and uncertainties at low doses ; and local exposures and effects of the Chernobyl accident .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings owing to low disposal incomes .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
In India , for example , where the overwhelming proportion of the work force is engaged in the unorganized or informal sector which should not be confused with the illegal sector , as has sometimes been done the extent of unemployment or underemployment measured by the criterion of time spent at work is relatively low .  
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
It was indicated that the initial assumptions had been somewhat optimistic and that slower programming and low implementation is also attributable to the fact that increasingly projects are supported only by earmarked contributions , limiting UNDCP 's flexibility to be responsive to emerging priorities .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
This document addressed a wide range of problems , including a worrying increase in crime throughout Bermuda ; low deployment of officers on patrol ; an excessively high ratio of officers of the rank of superintendent or above ; an extremely low proportion of civilian staff ; and police stations and accommodation that were cramped , badly designed or not of an acceptable standard .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In South-East Asia strong economic growth along with a relatively large and rapidly expanding population base has attracted a great deal of interest from Western investors in all areas of the agricultural and food chain , especially in processing and distribution .  Although the level of imports in most cases is relatively low for processed horticultural products , in some markets ( e.g .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
A significant proportion of neonatal deaths resulted from low birth-weight ; about 40 per cent of newborn babies were underweight because of maternal depletion , chronic malnutrition and lack of proper antenatal care .  
These actions focused on the three key elements of learning , work and social security , and included a new employment insurance legislation ; measures to assist low income families with children ; programmes for youth geared to enhancing work opportunities ; and more flexible transfer payments to provinces to support the development of innovative social programmes .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
Recently , many developing countries have abandoned the policy of supporting industrialization by maintaining agricultural prices low across the board and left prices to be determined on the market , expecting that resources would thus be allocated efficiently and market opportunities would be exploited .  
In tandem with the premium that new permanent members will enjoy as incumbents , this low level of support required will virtually ensure the automatic extension of new permanent members , rendering a periodic review meaningless .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
An independent central bank not only ensures low and stable rates of inflation , but through its autonomy from governmental interference in monetary policy also contributes to a healthy division of power in the economic sphere .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Another attractive feature of the ARGOS system is the small transmitters : the average daily electric current required is as low as a few milliamperes ; miniaturized models can be as compact as a small matchbox , weighing as little as 20 grams .  
During the first half of the year , the region was receiving substantial private credit inflows on a net basis , continuing a trend that had started in 1996 owing to low international interest rates and improving growth prospects .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
Poverty was particularly severe on the African continent , which experienced a wide variety of epidemic and endemic diseases , a very low literacy rate , hunger and malnutrition and heavy external debt .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
The health of the ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
With regard to the question posed by the delegation of the United States , he wished to make it very clear that there were two aspects to the issue of the minimum age for recruitment and that they were inseparable : the current standard was too low and must be raised , but that should not prevent it from being applied .  
More contemporary national and international discussion of how to achieve a balanced approach to macroeconomic policy could be very valuable , focusing on how to simultaneously address economic and social goals , such as full employment , low inflation and development in the fullest sense , including both efficient economic growth and an effective strategy for increasing equity .  
The triumph of capitalism in the second half of the twentieth century was largely based on its ability to regain popular legitimacy via the intervention of government to ensure low levels of unemployment and more acceptable distributional outcomes capitalism with a human face .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In many developing countries , low levels of technological accumulation point to a need for an overhaul of the educational system in order to incorporate basic technical and business education which will serve as a basis for either on-the-job training by firms or formal industry-wide education .  
There has been a dramatic but uneven increase in the flow of private capital , particularly equity capital , to developing countries . 11 In order to alleviate the balance-of-payment and debt problems and to increase income , many developing countries have adopted investor friendly policies such as low or no corporate taxes , tax holidays , subsidies to investors , and privatization . 
The world economy was growing well below its potential , a large number of developing countries were stagnant or had a declining GDP , prices of many primary commodities were at unusually low levels , social conditions in crisis countries had suffered serious setbacks , and downside risks were substantial .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
A United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF ) nutrition survey , conducted in April and May , confirmed that overall nutritional standards in Bahr Al Ghazal had improved , but from a very low initial level : the average global malnutrition rate , in fact , was 22 per cent .  
A country improves its chances of success in the struggle to reduce poverty when it achieves strong , sustained economic growth which creates a substantial expansion in the number of high-productivity jobs ; when the incomes such growth generates are also helped by a policy aimed at defending their purchasing power through low inflation ; and when support also exists in the form of significant programmes of well focused public transfers .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
Two aspects of Internet accessibility were addressed by the Gateway initiative : ( a ) user-friendly Web design based on universal principles to facilitate access by users with physical or sensorial disabilities and ( b ) text-based and low-intensity graphical content to facilitate access by users with low levels of information technology or communications capacities ( bandwidth ) .  
The decline in the rate of growth of LDCs recorded since 1996 was not only attributable to austerity measures related to the implementation of economic reforms but also to declining trends in ODA , the low level of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and depressed commodity prices .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups . 
The economic weaknesses of small island developing States were well known : narrow economic base , low levels of diversification , heavy dependence on external trade ; shortage of skilled manpower ; and the brain drain .  
For instance , there may be concomitantly higher levels of street and ( low visibility ) intra-familial violence , large proportions of the population that are severely disadvantaged and young ( that is , in the age groups perpetrating and suffering crime ) , rapid migration into urban areas , lack of trust in law enforcement , inefficient justice systems , corruption , limited good governance and severe competition for scarce resources .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
This has now changed to a vicious circle of depressed exports which discouraged investment , and vice versa ; the depression spread over the region and dampened exports which , together with low consumption resulting from uncertain economic prospects decreased aggregate demand and discouraged investment for the future .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In the years to come , for economies with a relative average development , the subject of employment , which was included as a commitment in Copenhagen , will be essential to overcoming the link between poverty , low productivity and insufficient levels of skilled human capital .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
Our purpose is to improve the quality of life of average and low income earners and to encourage equitable distribution of goods and services in the economic and social sector without excluding the customary and traditional values observed by communities , and to integrate programmes and activities in a manageable manner to ensure that strong community participation , commitment and ownership in various development areas can and will continue to be sustained .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
The Committee notes the observation of the Secretary-General , in paragraph 63 of annex I to the tenth progress report , that remote connectivity to IMIS is preferred in view of the low investment involved compared to the alternative of the deployment of complex administrative applications to duty stations .  
He therefore rejected the notion that the permanent members of the Security Council had a special financial responsibility for the non-peacekeeping activities of the United Nations , as well as the idea that the low per capita income adjustment should not be applied to the permanent members of the Council or that a regular budget floor rate should be set for those States .  
Indeed , accelerated economic growth is also of paramount importance if Africa is to reverse its increasing marginalization as reflected by quantitative indicators , particularly its small share of world trade , the limited inflows of foreign direct investment , its heavy debt burden , the relatively low utilization of communication technology , the falling standard of education , the deteriorating health services and the declining food self-sufficiency ratio .  
The low gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which was essentially equivalent to that of 1958 , although the population had tripled in size since that time , the annual demographic growth rate having risen from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent ;  
In addition to the physical injury resulting from the battery , battering during pregnancy can result in premature labour , miscarriages , recurrent vaginal infections , delivery of premature or low _ birth-weight infants with reduced chances for survival , sexual dysfunction , fear of sex , and sexually transmitted diseases .  
This study revealed that the amount of support ordered by judges or agreed to by the parties is extremely low and that the whole range of tools offered by the law for ensuring that the amount is fair are underused ( for example , petitioning for interim support , approaching the grandparents when the amount paid by the father is insufficient and having support payments withheld by the employer of the liable party ) and that there is a tendency for the liable party to default on payments .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Those small sections not considered problematic with a low authorized post base in which a marginal number of vacancies would generate a vacancy rate in excess of the budgeted level .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
These setbacks can be attributed , inter alia , to a harsh natural environment , inadequate economic policies , recurring droughts and the low level of development of social sectors .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
Inadequate budgetary allocations for the social sectors , slow disbursement of available funds , weak institutional and human resources capacities , and unreasonably low salary levels for civil servants are constraints common to all sectors .  
Demands of labour mobility accompanying the growth of the market economy in some developing countries have created a transient internal population , with low and insecure wages and poor access to housing , medical care and schooling for their children .  
Such economic , social and development policy measures have proven taxing on the national budget of an economy burdened with reconstruction , low investment and real growth rates and high unemployment , as is always the case in a postconflict society .  
A low per capita income adjustment with a threshold per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period , and with gradients based on the gross national product share of each eligible country as follows :

On the civil service level , it is often motivated by salaries so low and so infrequently paid that public servants are forced to choose between service to their country and meeting their families basic needs .  
In the light of low and unstable export earnings , limited access to private financial flows , small domestic savings and the serious debt problems experienced by these countries , ODA remains a critical source of their development finance .  
Three sets of factors can be proffered : the low savings base ( subsistence income levels ) ; weak institutional base for intermediation ( thin , fragile , fragmented financial system with limited financial instruments ) ; and decapitalization . 
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
The Committee is further concerned at the limited access of children with disabilities to formal or vocational educational opportunities and at the proportionally low number of girls attending primary or secondary school .  
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
For its part , it had initiated a systematic study of the effects of continuous low level exposure at the cellular , molecular and clinical levels on the health of the population in high natural background radiation areas in the state of Kerala .  
The Committee is similarly concerned by the different minimum legal ages for marriage , the absence of a defined minimum age of sexual consent for boys , the very high minimum age for consulting a doctor without parental consent and the extremely low minimum age of criminal responsibility - currently age seven .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .  
The Committee is further concerned at the low and decreasing number of trained health personnel , including mental health and social welfare professionals , which is contributing to the insufficient provision of essential services .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
Faced with the continuing low price of wool , the Department of Agriculture is endeavouring to encourage agricultural diversification , while programmes related to wool production and marketing continue to be a major focus , among them the Agricultural Subsistence and Incentive Scheme , designed to provide financial support and to assist in the improvement of existing farming operations or the development of new farm-based enterprises and the Pasture Improvement Programme .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
By 2005 , through a series of incremental steps , reach an overall target of annual expenditure on the epidemic of between US $ 7-billion and US $ 10-billion in low and middle-income countries and those countries experiencing or at risk of experiencing rapid expansion for prevention , care , treatment , support and mitigation of the impact of HIV / AIDS , and take measures to ensure that needed resources are made available , particularly from donor countries and also from national budgets , bearing in mind that resources of the most affected countries are seriously limited ;
