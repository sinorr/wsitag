He Xiaohong , a senior engineer with the autonomous region 's meteorological bureau , said such weather phenomenon was formed due to a recent significant cold air current coming southward down from the north of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . When it merged with the warm northward up current from the Indian Ocean between the Mount Nyainqentanglha and the Himalayas , rain or sleet was formed .  
98% of enterprises in Jiangsu Province are small and medium sized with a relatively weak capability for proprietary technological innovation .  They are also restricted by various factors such as their management expertise and composition of talent .  Their current competitive edge mainly relies on the advantage of imported equipment from abroad and cheap cost of labor .  
The special topics on the Chinese economy included a summary on Chinese economic development , the future of Chinese financial reforms , the choice of Chinese foreign exchange rate and trade surplus , and some current hot topics .  Six economists , including Xu Zhenhu , professor at Georgia State University in the United States , had shared their opinions on the issues .  
The basic framework of the study includes : The current population situation and developmental conditions of the Yangtze Delta Region , the regional property development , the developmental trends in property structure and employment population , the developmental trends in urbanization and the development of cities , the total population and the ecological carrying capacity of population resources , the aging of the population , and the social security system of urban and rural areas .

He said , current world economic globalization is developing deeply , investment flow is faster than trade flow , overseas investment and sales volumes of large western countries have greatly exceeded local import values , the proportion of foreign investments replacing direct imports is significantly increasing .  
Leaders of respective places and units are convinced that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech has penetratingly analyzed the current situation and existing problems in party building from the strategic level of initiating a great project to improve the party , has incisively explained the great significance and utmost importance of tightening party discipline under the new situation , has put forward demands for tightening party discipline , and has clearly pointed out directions for improving the party 's style of work , promoting the building of a clean and honest government and launching struggles against corruption .  
Under the current complex situation of the world featured by in-progress multi-polarity of politics as well as globalization of economy , China wishes to join hands with the old friend to work out a flexible and diversified way for cooperation , and the way does not necessarily have a fixed form , so to move the friendly cooperation between the two countries to a newer and higher level .  
Five years ago , President Jiang Zemin laid out an eight-point proposal for the current development of cross-strait relations , acting in line with the basic interests of the Chinese nation , and showing full consideration and understanding for the interests and sentiments of the Taiwan people .  It took the high ground , being wise and foresighted , to be jointly supported and responded to by Chinese people both in China and abroad , including the Taiwan people .  
During the UN Trade Development Council meeting , representatives of the international organizations and developing nations strongly called for reforming the current international rules and regulations , establishing a just and reasonable international political and economic order , and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor .

* China 's current deflationary trend has appeared in a deeply changed market order in our economic transformation .  It is mild and to a certain extent corrective , accompanied not by economic recession or depression , but rather fast economic growth , as well as being affected by international prices .  
We hold that , as to the current operating state of the Chinese national economy , there is no need to over-debate the meaning of deflation , because these three versions have a common economic focus , or that China 's overall prices have been in a sustained falling trend for over two years since October 1997 .  
For historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic .  In the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .

In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .  
Judging from the actual needs of the current national economic growth , Xiang Huaicheng said , the proactive fiscal policy still requires the necessary policy efforts in order to achieve the goals of ultimately expanding internal demand and promoting steady economic growth and to provide guarantee for quality and efficient development in national economic restructuring and scientific and technological advancement .  
What is worthy of attention is that because the proposition on " Taiwan independence " has never been accepted by the majority of the Taiwan people , those who have adhered to " Taiwan independence , " have , out of current political needs , asserted that " Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country , " and Taiwan has never been recognized as a part of China 's territory .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
4 .  Article Nine of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall organize and mobilize their members to study Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory ( of building socialism with Chinese characteristics ) ; study current political affairs ; learn and exchange professional , scientific , and technological knowledge ; and enhance their abilities of serving the motherland .  
Deputy Wang Yumei , 26-year-old " king breeder of rabbits " and general manager of the Jinan Lushe Rabbit Breeding Corporation , expressed a compassion of innocence in her remarks : " Without the party 's policy on encouraging the people to attain prosperity and the relaxed environment that encourages the development of various economic undertakings under different types of ownership , it would be impossible for me to transform , within 10 years , a small breeding farm with a few workers into a corporation whose current assets are worth 56 million yuan . "

We must be clearly aware that we are still faced with arduous tasks and severe challenges in our current efforts to realize the grand target of China 's modernization building and narrow China 's development gap with the world 's advanced development level .  Therefore , we have no reason whatsoever to be conceited and complacent , or cease to go any further ;  
ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development ; truly step up building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and a legal system ; and endeavor to accomplish all tasks set forth by the current NPC session .  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
In other words , they attempt to bring developing countries to their strategic track and force developing countries to facilitate their hegemonist goal and to be their dependencies .  However , most developing countries have the bitter experience of being bullied and humiliated by Western big powers , thus they extremely treasure their national sovereignty and dignity and , of course , resolutely oppose and struggle against the so-called " human rights standard " and the " values " foisted on them by the current hegemonist powers .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory . Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .  The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Wen Jiabao stressed : In the new period of economic development , to maintain the national economy 's sustained , high-speed , and healthy development , it is necessary to make strategic adjustment of the economic structure .

This will energetically boost foreign investment in the central and western regions .  
Experience has proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , work patterns , and leadership systems for the anti-corruption campaign defined by the Central Committee are entirely correct , effective , and in keeping with China 's basic circumstances during the current phase .  They are the fundamental guarantee that we will continually achieve new results in the fight against corruption .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
My esteemed fellow colleagues : Not long ago , the Chinese Government issued the white paper on " the one-China principle and the Taiwan issue . "  In this paper , we reiterated our principle and stance on the Taiwan issue , that is , upholding the one-China principle and the basic principles of " peaceful reunification and one China , two systems , " opposing any attempts of splitting China and permanently maintaining the current state of separation , and not allowing the Taiwan issue to drag on indefinitely .  
It can be anticipated that in a period to come , the huge demand of the Western Region for building materials , engineering machinery , industrial equipment , electronic products and other supplies will greatly stimulate the production of relevant industries and make a large number of enterprises free themselves from their current situation of operating under capacity .

However , under the current material conditions , ideological and political work can solve problems in people 's minds to different degrees , can better give play to the initiative role of people 's mentality , and make up for the temporary shortage of the material forces with people 's mental forces .  This will prompt the people to create more material wealth .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .

First , the final document avoids a grim aspect of the current international security situation in order to achieve unanimity in consultations .  In recent years , military factors have increased in international relations , with some military groups being expanded and strengthened .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
On this foundation , the Guangzhou military area artillery group continues to deepen the trial .  They expanded the " rapid reaction " system to a digital system that is command motor agile , correspondent network convenient , message current , reconnoiter measure diversity , which brings about the entirely digital automation from reconnoiter goal , message handle and assistant determination to the whole process of shooting .  
By saying that we should dare to say something new not mentioned by the old ancestors , he meant that as the times are moving ahead and practice is developing , new conditions and new issues will emerge in an endless stream , and it is impossible to find ready-made answers and solutions for our current issues from the works of the old ancestors .  We must work out solutions by ourselves by integrating the universal principles of Marxism with our current conditions and practice through studying new conditions , answering new questions , and blazing new trails .  
cherish the current gratifying reform , opening-up , and modernization situation ; and initiate what is useful to the Internet and do away with the harmful while performing their duties .

The professors revealed that Harbin Institute of Engineering has all along played a major role in our country 's deep-dive lifesaving research .  Our country 's deep-dive lifeboats are now equipped with a dynamic orientation system developed by the institute .  At present , the institute is still working on a more advanced dynamic orientation system , which could help maintain orientation in various directions with a power device and enable a rescue vessel to quickly link up with a target vessel even when there is rushing current deep in the sea ;  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .

These repair personnel have been assigned to work in accompanying teams , advance teams , and mobile supply teams .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
Meanwhile , the current international situation remains relatively complicated .  While peace and development are the main themes at present , hegemonism and power politics still exist .  The unfair and unreasonable international economic order is still playing its role , and the wealth gap between developing and developed countries keeps widening .  
However , in terms of law enforcement and construction of the ranks of cadres , there are some problems that can not be overlooked : The effort made in cracking down on criminal and economic crimes is not responsive to the needs of the current severe public security situation .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .

It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria .  
The current national security concept was put forward by Clinton in 1993 .  Clinton held that as the United States holds obvious military strength and military technology superiority over any other potential rivals , it is completely possible to effectively respond to certain crises and to deal with uncertain factors anytime in the future .  
However , China 's current legal system is yet to be refined .  According to the guideline set by the 15th CPC National Congress , by 2010 , China should establish a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  As such , legislation is still an arduous task lying ahead for people 's congresses at all levels and their standing committees .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
In the New Year editorial , the DPRK stated that it would , in the new year , " streamline the current economic foundation , carry out comprehensive transformation of the economy with modern technologies and methods , step up the building of power , coal , metallurgy , rail transport sectors , increase agricultural production , develop the light industry , and raise the people 's living standards . "  
However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
In the current international circumstances which are undergoing profound changes , while concentrating our strength on advancing the modernization drive and continuing to open up to the outside world , we must keep ourselves sober-headed against the infiltration of the Western ideology .  An important thing we should do is to persistently apply the dialectical materialist and historical materialist point of view to observe the complicated social phenomena .  
Discussing the current work of taking stock of and straightening out " state investments , " Dai Xianglong revealed that in the past one or two years the central bank has held frequent consultations with local governments on the question of straightening out trust and investment companies , because the great majority of these companies , apart from a few , are the equity controlling or total investment companies of the local governments .  
Researchers Pan Houren and Zhou Jiahua held that today , when material living standards are improving all the time , it is extremely important to build a rich and excellent cultural life ; the current measures such as small district sports and public welfare facilities which are now being built in a big way , and the rural cultural activities launched by organizing peasants who have become rich are extremely beneficial .  
They say the current society and laws must first be destroyed before they can preach their teachings .  On several occasions , Li Hongzhi issued " personal instructions " to practitioners , ordered them to lay siege to government organs and newspaper offices , engaged in illegal gathering and anti-government activities , and served as a pawn for foreign anti-China forces in a vain attempt to play a role that the western anti-China forces have failed to do .

This reporter has learned from the Ministry of Labor and Social Security that the current sustained growth of national economy can help create jobs ; however , as economic restructuring will be intensified , the number of workers laid off by state-owned enterprises is expected to remain at a fairly high level in 2001 .  Moreover , a noticeable increase in the numbers of new members of the work force and unemployed personnel directly seeking job in the labor market will bring considerable pressure on Chinese cities and country in employment this year .  
Vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is very important for us to live through the rigid test of reform , opening up and developing the socialist market economy and continuously advancing the current great project .  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
Our current tasks are extremely arduous , such as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises , realigning industrial structures , increasing peasant income , re-arranging laid-off workers , expanding social employment , balancing the distribution of incomes , and setting up and improving the socialist security system .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .  
Our military 's current budget-making method was based on the planned economy .  It is true that this method has played a positive role in ensuringassuring the all aspects of military in every construction , but this method has such problems , such as being too general in contents , not being transparent and being too weak to bein binding .  
Yang pointed out : With the deepening of the reform , the expansion of the opening up , and the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure , China 's administrative and management structures have been reformed accordingly and marked results have been scored .  However , the problem of the current administrative and management structures being unable to completely meet the demands of the socialist market economy still exists .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
He said that under the current international situation of multipolarization and economic globalization , the developing countries should intensify unity and coordination , cope with all problems in a positive attitude , and make concerted efforts to establish a fair , reasonable new international political and economic order .  
At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .  To retort , Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai pointed out in all seriousness that the United States was keen to dish out human rights motions against other countries , wantonly attacked other countries ' political systems by flaunting the banner of " safeguarding human rights , " tried hard to turn human rights issues into political issues for achieving its political purpose of exerting pressure onto other countries .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
It must be pointed out that the Dalai 's current visit to Taiwan is another adverse current designed to split the motherland since the Taiwan authorities gave the green light in mid-March to an overseas " Taiwan independence " organization - - the " World Taiwan Society , " which staged a farce in Taiwan of openly clamoring for " building the country through Taiwan independence . "  
The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
The conference demanded that the whole party and all levels throughout the country make common efforts and devote great energy to resolve the current conspicuous problems in public order , resolutely achieve the objective of bringing about a marked turn for the better in public order within two years , properly ensure that the masses can live and work in peace and contentment , properly preserve the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and provide an effective guarantee for socialist reforms and opening up and modernization .  
Zhang Wannian 's current visit is carrying on the past traditions and opening a way for the future , which is aimed at increasing mutual understanding and trust , promoting friendly cooperation , and impelling the steady and healthy development of relations between the two countries and armies .  
In the current struggle , we must create an awe-inspiring situation , fully mobilize the masses , strengthen mass prevention and mass treatment , and spread a far-lung network with which to prevent and crack down on crime so that criminal elements whose cases are serious will be held in awe and hit hard , and those who committed petty crimes will repent and make a fresh start and begin their lives anew .  
The editorial says : The current incident of bumping aircraft was caused by the US side single-handedly based on human testimony and material evidence .  However , the US side made unfounded countercharges after the incident , unreasonably criticized the Chinese side , and even used international law to evade its responsibility .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
According to the spirit of the central economic work conference and the Fourth Session of the Ninth National People 's Congress , the meeting analyzed the current situation , unified people 's thinking , and set forth the main tasks and key points for this year 's work .  
The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .

They said that Taiwan must come up with short - , medium - and long-term Mainland policies and objectives to deal with the " intermediate agreement " that the US side once mentioned , and the " one country , two systems " formula the Mainland authorities persistently follows.Some other MAC members pointed out that the government has been acting rather passively in approaching current international affairs .

The current forum - - " Next Generation Asia " - - devoted to discussions on such issues as corporate management , competition advantages , information infrastructure construction , and electronic commerce , will be conducive to improving the management level of enterprises in Asia , promoting the development of the Asia economy , and benefiting all the parties concerned in seeking business opportunities .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;

During his " journey to establish communication , " Mr . Siew explained on many occasions that he favors adopting the model of European economic union under the current conditions of political deadlock across the Taiwan Strait to implement the concept of economic cooperation by shelving disputes and proceeding in an orderly and gradual manner and in stages in accordance with the " common market " formula .  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
Encouraged by the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to China and out of the worry about and righteous indignation at the " Taiwan independence " splittist forces ' attempt to split the country , Chinese nationals residing abroad and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have taken active actions and conscientiously plunged themselves into the powerful current of opposing " Taiwan independence " and division and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland , thus forming a grand-scale upsurge of patriotism .  
However , at least before the election to be held by the end of this year , the current relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong suffers from no immediate and obvious conflict of political interests nor any unfavorable subjective and objective factors to their interactions .  Even if Lee Teng-hui vigorously reveals that the main character of the scandal of Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corporation is in fact Lien Chan , it still can not undermine the present relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong .  
Professor Yin Naiping of Taiwan National Chengchi University held : Taiwan could not control some of the factors that contributed to its current economic , financial , and banking difficulties , for example , international economic recession and burdens left behind from the past .  However , we could not deny that due to their incompetent administration , Taiwan authorities have created additional problems , inappropriately handled problems left behind from the past , and further aggravated Taiwan 's economy .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
The factors that have enabled triad-related and evil forces to survive and expand over a long period of time in the past have also proved a key issue for the concentrated study and analysis of procuratorial organs at all levels in their current case-handling work of examining and rectifying arrests and instituting legal proceedings .  The Supreme People 's Court has stressed that cases involving the " protective umbrellas " of triad-related and evil forces which are reported to the authorities by the masses shall be resolutely investigated and dealt with as key cases .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .

At this critical moment for carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future , the party Central Committee and the State Council are holding a relevant meeting to summarize past experience and arrange the work for the next 10 years .

Some current provincial governors and ministers ( excluding those in special departments ) between the ages of 62 and 65 years ( the age for retirement at this level ) will be retired ahead of time by the end of this year so that their younger successors may be elected into the party central committee next year at the 16th party congress .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .  
Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .

P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .  Without long-ranch fighters and forward bases , the United States has very limited capability to counter the PLA 's attack on Taiwan . In a modern war that emphasizes quick decision , US rescue to Taiwan would be too slow to meet the urgent need when the PLA launches an attack on Taiwan .  
This important directive fully demonstrates that firmly establishing the viewpoint of the masses , adhering to the line of the masses and solving practical problems faced by the masses are crucial to strengthening and improving party-building .  This directive explicitly points out the direction for our current educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
It is for this reason that Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , respectively the core of the first three generations of the leadership group of the Party Central Committee , published at crucial moments in the revolution and construction important speeches on " the current situation and the task , " comprehensively and correctly analyzed the domestic and international situation at that time and educated the Party , the military and the people .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .

In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong .

Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
According to Cheng Yun-peng , director of the publicity department of the DPP , who accompanied him to visit Lee , the atmosphere of the talks was relaxed and harmonious .

It is essential to have a profound understanding of the long-term , arduous and complex nature of the work against corruption .  Not only is it necessary to be prepared for protracted battles , but also intensify our efforts to address current issues .  
All comrades in the party should set up a lofty communist ideal , fortify their conviction and spur themselves on by holding to lofty ideological and moral standards .

Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .

Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
A sweeping view of the current world shows that the tide of economic globalization is fast and violent , that science and technology progress with each passing day , that competition in overall national strength is increasingly keen , and that various ideologies are crisscrossing and surging against one another .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
Despite the fact that the current situation at home and abroad is favorable to us , we must soberly realize that China is developing its modernization program in a more complicated international environment .  Right now , the world is undergoing profound changes .  It is becoming more and more multi-polarized , and continuously marching toward economic globalization .  
However , some of the outstanding problems in the Party , especially problems among leading cadres with regard to Party spirit and conduct , were not solved .  A considerable number of leading cadres still fail to meet or completely meet the requirements in carrying out their tasks and keep pace with the current situation in the ideological and political realm .  
According to military sources , Chen zhen-xiang , taking a handful of Army General Headquarters officers with him , left for a secret visit to Europe on 30 June . At least Germany , Austria and Switzerland were included in his itinerary .

Ferreting out the " protective umbrella " of underworld and evil forces should be perceived as a major content of the current drive of investigating and handling on-the-job crimes , as an emphasis of the work in deeply promoting the anti-corruption campaign , and as an important content of the work in examining and approving the arrests of criminals and in examining lawsuits .  No matter what unit and what persons are involved , all cases must be investigated thoroughly regardless of obstructions so that the evil forces can be rooted out .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .

Diplomats of the two countries disclosed that Jiang Zemin and Putin will hold a summit meeting to exchange their views on the current international situation , major global and regional issues , including the US claim to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and its readiness to build the national missile defense system .  The two heads of state will reiterate their stands clarified during the " Shanghai Five " summit in June this year , namely , Putin stressed that Russia firmly safeguarded the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to prevent a new round of arms race ;  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
He then pointed out that the potential for expansion of economic relations between Belarus and China is far from being fully developed .  Measures must continue to be taken , and a new scope of cooperation and new projects must be identified .  The current pattern of pure trade must transform into more modern , more advanced methods of cooperation , such as joint research , development , and production of high-tech products .

To cope with the situation as quickly as possible , the government should increase high-technology weapons , get rid of the thinking of symmetrical operations , change the current situation in which the army amounts to a higher proportion in the three armed forces , and implement as quickly as possible the tactic of downsized troops .  In this way , the situation in which outlays for personnel maintenance accounts for half the annual defense budget and eats up the military investment budget can be avoided and fighting capability will be intensified .  
In fact , they are " deadlocks to be resolved . "  While intensifying efforts to publicize the issues of reducing and eliminating poor countries ' debts , the current G-8 summit was unable to implement any new and concrete measures to further reduce and eliminate poor countries ' heavy foreign debts even though $ 53-billion of foreign debts have been accumulatively reduced or exempted from 23 poorest countries in the world .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
Although it is extensively opposed by the international community , including US allies , development of the missile defense system is expected to require over $ 100-billion .

They also had an in-depth exchange of opinions on current major and urgent regional and international issues , thus reaching a broad consensus .  One of the most important results is that President Jiang and President Putin have signed the Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness , Friendship , and Cooperation . The treaty is permeated with peaceful thinking that the two countries will remain friends from generation to generation and never become enemies .  
The informed person said that in a situation report submitted earlier to the State Council , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held that in the current circumstances , the macroeconomic policy has little impact on stopping the slide in exports because the root cause of the deteriorating export situation this year is the slide of the US economy , that has led to a global economic slowdown .  In China , it is unsuitable to adopt such measure as the devaluation of the renminbi to stimulate exports .

At present this extremely reactionary view of history has not yet formed into the main current in Japanese society , and although the sound of just condemnation in society of past external aggression is not as loud as it was 20 or 30 years ago , it can not be ignored .  
However , the development of the railway transportation capacity still can not satisfy the needs in our national economic and social development .

We must do a good job in resolving problems of the current livelihood and long-term production development for peasants where farmland is bring returned to forest , and support the peasants in developing industries for which there are strong local resources and which meet market needs ; through developing small hydroelectric stations , methane , and so on , we should resolve the problems of the peasants ' fuel and rural energy , prevent indiscriminate tree-felling , and protect the results of returning farmland to forest .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that speeding up the perfection of the social security system is the urgent requirement of preserving social stability and consolidating and developing the current good development momentum , and is also a strategic move for achieving lasting political stability .  
As far as the whole country is concerned , the primary task at present is to unswervingly implement the central authorities ' current social security policies and measures , do a really good job in the " two assurances " work , and ensure that the basic living needs of laid-off workers from state enterprises and the basic pensions of retired workers are paid on time and in sufficient amount ; we absolutely can not have new debts arising in this respect .

Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .

In particular , adequate considerations should be given to the natural and geographical conditions and the actual circumstances of various localities .  
Those attending the forum said : President Jiang Zemin 's speech gave a systematic , complete , and incisive explanation on Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " and put forward an eight-point proposal for further developing cross-strait relations and promoting the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland in the current stage .  This fully reflected the determination and sincerity of the CPC and the Chinese Government to develop cross-strait relations and promote the reunification of the motherland and expressed all the Chinese people 's aspiration for reunification .  
With regard to the current issues in China 's management structure , there are three points that merit special attention : First , the contractual relationship between the principal and the agent is not sufficiently distinct , so that the agent does not understand what his functions are in the course of concrete operations , which are chiefly manifested in the failure to resolve such fundamental problems as the indistinct functions between the government and the enterprises and between the party and the enterprises .  
In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces .

One of the most prominent mistakes in this misunderstanding zone is this : Some immature methods adopted in the past by the Chinese intellectual elite and common Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have been considered as China 's democratic methods .  These methods have been treated as a standard for the evaluation of China 's current democratic progress .  Consequently , a misunderstanding zone has been created .  
" this year 's government work has the significance of taking over from the past and setting a new course for the future " ; the country 's strategic readjustment " should not only aim at settling current prominent problems , but should all the more set its eyes on long-term development " ; and that the 10th Five-Year Plan , which is to be formulated this year , " has a great bearing on China 's overall economic and social development during the early years of the 21st century . "  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .

Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .  Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .

Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
A military source said that the situation of current cross-strait ties is changeable and the period is crucial .  There is no need to be panic because it is quite normal and reasonable for the troops stationed along the coast to be on alert and to be prepared for all contingencies .  
It is rather ignorant of history and the current situation and quite arrogant for Chen Shui-bian to sell the old stuff in 2000 .  This is of no help for easing up the tense situation across the strait .  The Chinese people have waged a struggle against the US theory asserting that " Taiwan 's status is not yet settled " for more than four decades and the US ultimately recognized that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and there is only one China in the world ;  
With SOEs facing so many problems , the current problems that affect the overall order have a far-reaching impact , and must be solved are the strategic adjustment of our state-owned economy and the corporate-upgrading reform of SOEs These are two basic problems for intensifying SOE reform and fully stimulating the growth potential of our national economy .

He also made extensive contacts with personalities of the economic and trade , business , science and technological , educational , and cultural circles of the six nations ; and visited and investigated factories , farming villages , and some representative cultural facilities .

It is necessary to take advantage of the opportune moment of the WTO entry to leave no stone unturned to expand exports and heighten the level of using foreign capital , maintain the current momentum of growth in foreign trade , and exercise the role of export demand in promoting economic growth .  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .

The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of purchasing peasants ' surplus grain without restriction , the State Council decided to increase the scale of grain risk funds by 8 billion yuan this year , which is to be shared by the central and local financial authorities according to the current proportion they are responsible for ;

However , Annette Lu , a person who holds a master 's degree in law , has disregarded the historical facts and legal documents at the current moment when cross-strait relations are facing a severe test .  She has confounded right with wrong , and replayed in an unscrupulous manner the " old tune " of " Taiwan independence . "  
Our current uncoordinated grain production and marketing structure is a very glaring problem , with a shortage of quality varieties , a surplus of popular and dependable varieties , a lack of adaptation to market demand , and the inability to sell at good prices being the key reasons for the grain selling difficulties and for peasants producing more but earning less .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .

Under the current social conditions where China is carrying out reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , the broad masses of academicians and scientists of the older generation should pay special attention to teaching , helping , and guiding the younger generation ideologies , work style , and academic attitudes .

The questions of how we should approach the current international and domestic situations , how we should approach the various problems cropping up in China 's reform and opening up especially in the course of building a socialist market economy , and how we should face the difficulties and challenges facing our economic and social lives all have to do with the political conviction of party-member cadres and all the more with the confidence and morale of the broad masses of the people .

Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by an increase in invisible trade surplus .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2000 with the third quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 10.5 billion to $ 14.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 32.8 billion to $ 38.9 billion .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .

In view of the economic situation , the Housing Authority has not adjusted its public housing rents since 1998 .  The rents for many flats are still at 1995 levels .  Arising from other factors such as the sale and redevelopment of housing estates and the allocation of larger flats , the current median rent-to-income ratio is above 10% .  However , to the extent that this phenomenon has arisen not as a direct consequence of rental adjustments , the Housing Authority has not broken the law .  
The need and reasonableness of an across-the-board cut is doubtful .  The Housing Authority 's current measure to re-assess the rent for individual commercial tenant according to commercial principles can better reflect the reality and help needy tenants maintain their competitiveness .  Rental reductions will not benefit shop tenants which have been enjoying prosperous business .  If so , this would be a waste of public funds .

This would help the licensees through the current economic hard times , " Ms Chung said in her letter .

At a response rate of 72% , a total of 8 000 households were successfully enumerated for their views on a wide range of issues of concern to persons in the labour force , including challenges / problems encountered in the current jobs , perceived prospects of the currently engaged economic sectors and occupation categories , impact brought about by corporate restructuring since 2001 , personal career aspirations , experience in and aspirations for working in the Mainland , and experience in and plan for attending job-related training / retraining courses .  
* The figures derived from the survey relate only to RMLs provided by authorized institutions on the basis of first mortgages and which the reporting institution knows to be in negative equity ( i.e . the outstanding loan amount with the reporting institution exceeds the current market value of the mortgaged property ) .  Not included in these figures are some 58,400 RMLs associated with government-funded co-financing schemes and another 23,200 RMLs associated with private sector co-financing schemes .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2003 with the first quarter of 2003 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit decreased from $ 16.0 billion to $ 9.8 billion , as exports of goods remained robust , while import for local use was cut back distinctly amidst the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) .  
This was largely due to a markedly reduced current account surplus , as the spread of SARS in the second quarter resulted in a distinct setback in inbound tourism and related service exports , and hence a shrinkage in invisible trade surplus , and as net external factor income inflow also contracted considerably .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Although a large number of surplus teachers and fresh graduates of the Hong Kong Institute of Education ( HKIEd ) have indicated that it is difficult to secure a teaching post , I have received complaints that some schools have employed untrained university graduates as " permitted teachers " in the current school year .  
The main challenges in central banking are to maintain a monetary and banking environment that is optimal for stable and sustainable economic growth , and , particularly in the case of present-day Hong Kong , an environment that is conducive to resolving our current problems .  
* Most viewers ( ranging from 51.6% to 89.7% ) agreed to retaining the existing restriction / prohibition on advertisements for the following categories of products or services which are unacceptable under the current generic code of practice , namely undertaker service , unlicensed employment services , organisations advertising to giving betting tips , betting , night clubs and massage parlours involving shows of sexual behaviour , escort service targeting persons under 18 and pay-per-call information services of a sexual nature .  
The Wide Field of Plastics With active assistance of the government and continued efforts of businessmen , the plastics industry in Taiwan , though starting late , has developed very rapidly . Beginning with processing imported raw materials into daily necessities , then expanding to the current export of self-produced raw materials , its development has been beyond expectation . Plastics have become an important key to the economic development of the Republic of China .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
As a result , I discovered , as we rehearsed , that they had made a lot of progress . " The combined performances of the 10 dancers who took part in the 1982 Arts Festival provided a rare opportunity to observe the current level of Chinese dance , and how naturally traditional culture and modern dance training have been combined in a free environment to create a base for its development .  
In selecting the subject matter for each series , the group tries to adhere to some specific guidelines . There are four main areas which serve as sources of stamp subjects . The first of these are themes drawn from the rich cultural heritage of Chinese tradition . Other selections are made in accordance with certain international activities such as the " International Year of the Child " , and still another criteria for selection are important current events .  
Apart from foreign debts , many communist ideologues find other reasons to oppose the current liberal policies . Some deplore the presence of " spiritual pollution " , seeing a growing materialism among mainland Chinese . Others view foreign investment as pure and simple exploitation of cheap labor , with the special treatment afforded to foreign firms and their workers inimical to the spirit of equality that communism was supposed to bring .  
The Blues and the Whites are two teams of popular singers , different each week , including current stars , experienced old hands , and hopeful newcomers , who compete in singing a gamut of songs in Mandarin , Taiwanese , and English : from romantic ballads , folk tunes , and art songs to pop and disco . . . . The variety of songs and singers appeals to young and old alike .  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
So starting from the present , the party should expand the channels for participation and communication , so that party members and cadres have ample opportunity to express their opinions . A view of the current political situation reveals ever-changing and treacherous trends and widespread military conflict . The antagonism between the two extremes of freedom and slavery as well as of democracy and totalitarianism has never let up in the least .  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
It does the last because it allows ROC citizens to practically comprehend the mainland , and allows the country 's future to be decided by open discussion ; in this way there slowly takes shape a consensus . Given Taiwan 's objective and subjective conditions , there is no way to accept either reunification under Chinese communist rule or absolute independence . It is necessary to undertake , under the current structure , maximum democratization internally and moderate , cautious exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , to achieve the objective of peaceful evolution .  
A : I only focus on how to do the job that I am doing at the current time . I have never considered the problem of future office . Because I personally believe that the Kuomintang has many talented people , the Kuomintang should select someone of accomplishment and moral fortitude to serve as the president 's main assistant .  
ConclusionThe four major programs and eleven key areas reported on above are the most salient of the government 's current administrative plans , aimed in essence at outlining a blueprint for future national development , and I hope you will be unsparing in your criticism and suggestions with regard to any points that may be inappropriate .  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
Another prominent young Chinese of the upper echelons is Jose Chen Barria , previous head of the Bureau of Immigration , and current deputy chief auditor , who is considered something of a rising star .  
" When the current eight secondgeneration warships are completed , we will have the capability for independently designed and produced large-scale warships , which in the future can be sold abroad , " explains a high ranking officer from the naval construction development center , indicating confidence in the project scheduling .  
Basically speaking , we use a collage or cut-and-paste postmodern method , using the technique to strengthen a consumer 's impression of a commercial , " explains Hsu Shun-ying , who is creative director at the Yi Shi Hsing Tai Agency , which is responsible for Stimoral 's ads . The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
" We have to fight as few battles that we 're not sure of winning as possible to avoid wasting limited resources on meaningless frays , " says Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien , who states that our current foreign policy is oriented mainly toward regional , economic and functional areas .  
One unmarried social worker is worried that if she marries , it will affect her current employment . Another is worried about the problem of educating her children in the future , and keeps putting off getting married . Yet another , a single woman who owns an interior design business , quite frankly sticks to a philosophy of remaining single as a way to reduce the responsibilities of housework , " states the Cheng-Liao study .  
More than half the members of the current Diet are Waseda alumni , and the school has turned out four prime ministers , including Noboru Takeshita and Toshiki Kaifu . The Waseda " old school tie " network helps its own and wields tremendous clout . Besides featuring new academic concepts , the research center combines the latest art and technology in its architecture - - spacious , attractive buildings nestled in the hills . The big lecture halls , which can seat hundreds , are equipped with five or six television screens hooked up to the podium .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
You can find an oceanic current running by the islet on the east and west sides , the Kuroshio , which is a warm current from the equator . This comfortable and clear sea water has spawned a rich and beautiful foundation of ocean resources for Green Island .  
As for outsider divers , Mr . Chen has " some thing I 'd like to say " : " They go down to the bottom wearing heavy gear , but do n't understand the nature of the water ; when they 're hit by a sudden current and ca n't get their footing , they end up carelessly grabbing and breaking off and stepping all over and destroying the coral . " But it 's the local fishermen who get stuck with the reputation for destroying the ecology .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
The great air pollution killer - - the motor vehicle : " Development of an electric car is an inevitable global trend , " contends Yang . Whether it be from the point of view of efficient use of resources or from that of environmental protection , the electric vehicle is one of the most effective ways to resolve current pollution problems .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
Recently , Hollywood 's studios made some adjustments to Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid When these fairy tales were produced for the big screen so that the films would better conform with current feminist thinking . In Beauty and the Beast , departing her former meek and submissive image , the character Beauty was depicted as an intelligent , independent , and headstrong woman who liked to read .  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .  
The path was built along the playful , light current of the crisp , green Shakatang River . The little trail runs not far above the river bed . After catching sight of such an unpolluted river , who can resist the temptation to leap into the bubbling waters and swim ?  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
In light of the current situation , the country will need professionals skilled in R &amp; D , foreign languages and simultaneous interpretation ; people who are possessed of an international perspective and are also familiar with the characteristics of international markets ; as well as practical personnel who have a good grasp of such aspects as finance , transportation , and communication in the operation of international business .  
Just a moment ago your bare arms and legs were a little numb from the cold air . Now they 're numb because the heat is making your blood vessels throb , and your whole body is limp . When you ca n't stand that hot current running through your body any longer , just splash yourself with some cold water .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
When she writes about her current home , New York ( especially Central Park ) , or about places she has visited such as Alaska or Egypt , the mood is peaceful and unburdened . The world belongs to the creatures of the sky . The music for this world is written as a series of steady half-notes , occasionally augmented by a graceful glissando of eighth notes .  
It 's a place of dramatic cliffs and gigantic boulders , where white sand beaches meet grasslands . But more than this , its special geographic location puts it in the middle of the Kuroshio current , which runs from the equator and nurtures coral and tropical fish , making for a beautiful and colorful underwater world .  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by . Menacing lionfish , covered with what seem to be thorns and claws , swim along face down . Upon seeing human divers - - what strange creatures ! - - sea snakes swim by and touch their flippers . . . .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
Sincerely , Yen Hsing-chen , Saiitama Prefecture , JapanEditor 's reply : When selecting articles for reprinting in Sinorama , our principal consideration has always been reflecting the multifaceted phenomena and opinions of Taiwan 's society . Our choice of comics is inclined toward those that use a humorous style to reflect the current social conditions .  
Apart from some so-called " armorial porcelain " especially decorated with family crests , what is most interesting is the various kinds of European themes used : for instance , plates bearing humorous pictures to do with current events , like the Rotterdam riot , British elections , and the collapse of the Amsterdam stock market ; there were also biblical and mythological scenes .  
Sam Wen says that the current crop of pro players , when youths in the 1970s , ran all around the world for international competitions , bearing the burden of national pride and struggling for medals . Their growth process was somewhat distorted , leaving them with many habits such as enjoying special privileges , wanting advantages , and having a little too much self-admiration . The players must of course work harder at growing up .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context . " It is very possible that , given a certain atmosphere in society , the interviewee knows very well what the interviewer is aiming at , and just tells him or her what they want to hear , " cautions Wang Ming-ko , an associate researcher at the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  
Ma Kai suggests that one reason for the current rise in frictional unemployment is that , now that Taiwan is wealthy , far fewer young people need to be so careful about hanging on to an " iron rice bowl " ( as secure jobs are called by Chinese ) . In addition , the implementation of national health insurance means that job-seekers have one major worry off their minds . It was thus only to be expected that frictional unemployment has risen rapidly .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
In the current situation , with cross-straits relations being less than ideal , if small and medium sized enterprises are having difficulty growing in Taiwan , we wo n't prohibit them from investing in the mainland . But , if it 's a large enterprise , an important industry , or an infrastructure investment , the movement of these kinds of investments into the mainland one after another is not beneficial to our national development , and we must take more stringent measures .  
It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
The electricity runs through the circuits like the transmitting material in the human nervous system , which allows the brain to remember , select , calculate , and even listen , speak , read , and write , undertaking all kinds of " intelligent " tasks . The applications of the flow of electric current in a circuit are virtually limitless :  
Chienkuo High School , generally recognized as a " star school , " has already determined that its outstanding selected students will not be judged exclusively by the standard of academic grades . Particular emphasis will also be placed on performance in activity groups , in order to " lend balance " to their current student population , whose on-campus activities lean heavily in favor of scholastic pursuits .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
In 1973 , it was generally agreed that jurisdiction over the media should be unified in a single agency . So the Executive Yuan took publication industry affairs from the Ministry of the Interior , and film and broadcast affairs out of the Bureau of Education and Culture , and moved both to the GIO . The GIO doubled in size overnight , assuming its current structure of six departments and three divisions .  
In the records of the late Eastern Han , the " Guanglingsan " was listed as folk music current in the Han and Wei regions , but in the records of the Song , it says " the ' Guanglingsan ' is no longer extant . " Lin Ku-fang points out that the music of ancient China always persisted extraneous to statements whether it was extant or not ; it was preserved in a state so that at times it was hidden , at times evident .  
It can be seen that a multitude of factors affect textbook selection , and that underneath lies a struggle involving power , gain and values . Many of the underlying processes are unknown to the average person , with power and its application being the most important hidden factors . In the current textbook reform , another question which should be addressed is thus " Do our teachers truly have the ability to select texts ? "  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
For example , the monthly base fee for a mobile phone has gone from NT $ 1800 , before market liberalization was announced , to the current NT $ 600 . Use charges have fallen from NT $ 12 per minute to less than half that .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
However , the government 's performance did not meet the expectations of the citizens of Macedonia , and in the third parliamentary elections , held last October and November , a coalition of moderate-right parties organized only half a year ago-led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Party / Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity-won 62 of the 120 seats in parliament . With this majority they formed a new government , and the current premier , 32-year-old Ljupco Georgievski , has become the symbol of a new generation of reformers .  
The waves stirred up when the ROC established formal ties with the Marshall Islands and Macedonia are but one example of the ROC 's and PRC 's diplomatic wrangling . Yet they illustrate clearly the ROC 's current situation in regard to its allies . The most feasible way for the ROC to maintain or expand the number of nations with which it has formal ties is to engage in an economic - and trade-based diplomacy that provides these nations with Taiwan 's ample experience in economic development .  
In fact , because there is nowhere else for hazardous waste to go , under current regulations waste which has been solidified or stabilized , and which passes leaching tests to ensure that there is no danger of toxins escaping , can be buried in segregated areas of city and county sanitary landfills .  
His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
George Newstrom , who is corporate senior vice-president at EDS and chairman-elect of the World Information Services Technology Alliance , spoke on the theme " Preventing the Technological Eclipse of Humanity . " He expressed his concerns about the current creation of " technology for its own sake . " While conceding that technology is a wonderful thing , Newstrom said that the question is : " Can we grow up and learn fast enough to handle the awesome power and potential that technology offers ? "  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
Former president Lee Teng-hui was a devout Presbyterian who said more than once that he planned to do missionary work after he retired from politics . In the early morning three days after his election , current ROC President Chen Shui-bian went to the Nungchan Temple in northern Taipei , where he visited Master Sheng Yen . Chen revealed that he had come there previously to meditate and listen to the master 's enlightened words after Chen had failed in his bid to be reelected as Mayor of Taipei City .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
Moreover , the residents of Tannan village have always supported themselves through farming and manual labor , but the nation 's current economic lull coupled with the presence of foreign labor has caused unemployment rates to increase steadily . The consequences of Typhoon Toraji last year , erosion , and the loss of arable land , have deepened the region 's economic turmoil , further impairing the prospects of reconstruction . At present , only five or six houses are under construction .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
In May of this year , the government formally declared " digital content " to be one of the " twin star " industries . It plans to pour NT $ 5 billion into the industry over the next four years , establish a " digital content college " that will cultivate IT skills among artists and writers , and encourage venture capitalists to invest also in the hope of growing the industry 's annual production value to more than NT $ 200 billion , four times its current value , in five years .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
" Perhaps digital content is no different in its basic nature from the writing , language , physical artifacts and images , and video programs we have long been familiar with , " explains Hwang Tai-yang . But once information of all kinds is digitized , and converted into virtual ones and zeros that can flow as an electric current , there will no longer be any obstacles to its crossing platforms to be transmitted , stored , accessed and used at will .  
Eventually , Min Sheng Daily agreed to add another gig , and the 2500 tickets for that were cleaned out in a single morning . After the event , the emcee , Chen Kai-lun , said that this was the most moving event he had ever hosted . There was not an empty seat to be found , no one left halfway through , and everyone felt as if they were being carried back in time on a genteel current of luxurious music .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
Moreover , Taiwan has an extremely comprehensive economic structure , from agriculture and textiles from the early period of industrialization to later-stage petrochemical and precision-machinery industries to the current information technology , optical electronics , and communications sectors . We have a dense web of up - and downstream economic activities . Moreover , Taiwan 's many small enterprises have organizational structures as flexible and adaptable as changelings , so peripheral support industries and core industries can develop together , and it is very easy to subcontract out work .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
Dance therapists find that the same activity will be expressed in various ways . Some patients act like a bionic man with extraordinary strength , possibly showing violent tendencies . Some appear to move effortlessly , as if they were light as feather . In each case the movement is a reflection of the patient 's current psychological state .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
But it is worth noting that these young people are rather dissatisfied with Taiwan 's current political and economic situation , and most believe they are powerless to affect the overall picture . This survey also points up an important trend : among this generation with its extremely high proportion of highly educated people , education level is a significant variable when it comes to values and dreams . Compared with the past , the dreams and values of highly educated people are driving and guiding the direction of this generation as never before !  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste . As for the disposition of collected kitchen waste , " 70% is used primarily for raising pigs , and composting accounts for 30% , " says Lin Tso-hsiang , section chief for kitchen waste recycling operations at the Environmental Protection Administration 's Bureau of Environmental Inspection . During the current phase , local governments have not been required to institute kitchen waste recycling ; they are merely encouraged to do so .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
After eight years of hard work laying the foundation for the company , artkey executive vice-president Ivan Fan surveys the current scene and gives her analysis . After mainland China joined the World Trade Organization , intellectual property on both sides of the strait benefited from increased international protection . At the same time , another " East Asia fever " is set to grip the world as we come up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .  
According to the fee schedules set by Taipei County 's Cable TV Fee Review Committee , the cost of accessing basic channels will be NT $ 150 per month . If other channels are selected , an additional charge will apply . However , the total may not exceed the current maximum for cable television fees of NT $ 600 . As for video services , users wishing to view other movies or videos will be charged extra for these .  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
The data collected by low-elevation weather stations lacks detailed information on high altitude cloud cover and air current changes , among other things . Although it is now possible to use satellite technology , high-altitude weather balloons and other advanced technology to measure the temperature , air pressure and humidity at high altitudes , the collection of data on such things as visibility , cloud type and cloud height depends on visual observation and can not be achieved by automated instruments .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .  
Shihpai , along with neighboring areas eastward to Tienmu and westward to Kuantu , has traditionally been an epicenter of high-value real estate in Taipei . Following the current resurgence , a realty office franchise sandwiched between a bakery and a hardware store next to the Shihpai MRT station witnesses an endless flow of individuals inquiring about real estate daily from the moment the doors open at eight o'clock in the morning till they close at 11 at night .  
Seeing the industry on the decline hurt him deeply , and when he heard about the Cultural Association 's plan to try and revive it , he leapt straight in , despite not quite getting the idea himself . After reflecting on the current situation-all his children and grandchildren had moved elsewhere to work in other industries , so there would be no-one to carry on the tradition-he decided to devote himself to trying to help rebuild the old farms and give them a second shot at life .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .

For the first time , a consistent , usable , minimum level of current mineralresource information , together with estimates of total undiscovered mineral endowment , will be provided for the entire United States .  
The unencumbered balance of appropriations , $ 34,655,950 gross ( $ 35,247,050 net ) as at 31 December 1993 , will be sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining MINURSO at its current military and civilian strength for a period of some 10 months .  
Based on these logistical factors , the existing UNOSOM aircraft fleet is not sufficient to meet current military and humanitarian requirements within Somalia .  
They stressed the need for a multisectoral approach and for diagnostic assessment of the current institutional arrangements and human resources capacity at the national level as a basis for formulating strategies for the future .  
Three additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1315 ) .  
The Special Commission outlined to the Iraqi side current activities to establish as soon as feasible a workable mechanism and practical modalities for monitoring pursuant to the ongoing monitoring and verification plan approved by resolution 715 ( 1991 ) .

The current draft guidelines for preparatory conferences in arbitral proceedings , which were intended to foster efficiency and predictability in international arbitrations , were an appropriate complement to existing UNCITRAL legal texts .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and to include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
The probability of sustained current recovery in the industrial countries would be greatly enhanced if the international community could take credible actions to realize the tremendous growth potential of developing countries .  
Such efforts should bring together those responsible for economic , financial and social policy and provide an integrated framework for guiding national and international policies aimed at meeting the current challenges of the world economy .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
It is crucial that the current complementary efforts by national and international organizations involved in mineclearing , mine awareness and education , technical assistance and assistance to the victims of mines be strengthened and accelerated ;  
International justice required independence from the decisions of political organs ; in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
We are aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a region , but there is no alternative to this path of collective self-reliance if our region is to survive in the current competitive international economic environment .  
We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
However , there is no doubt that progress towards a lasting , just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the continued , determined and coordinated efforts of the international community in the maintenance of a global approach to the current peace initiative and the continuation of the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime .  
The end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued the world during the cold war and the disappearance of the ideological demarcation line that divided the world into two camps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunity afforded us by the current transitional period to lay down new foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrow the economic gap between them .  
In the current thinking about the necessary reform measures , it is vital to keep in mind the reality of the dynamic change in the global economic and social spheres , the ever growing importance of market forces and the global nature of the changes .  
The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important in the historical development of the United Nations , not only because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional institution of universal scope , which was established to analyse , debate and seek solutions to problems of common concern to mankind , but also because current circumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the future of our Organization .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
In this spirit , before I described some specific reform recommendations my delegation is advancing in connection with the current agenda item , it would be helpful to the Assembly 's consideration of these ideas for me to preface them with four essential points : the diagnostic framework ; the historical context ; and the premises and the paramount objective that underlie our proposals .  
Therefore , in that regard , my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee , given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee 's work is progressive , innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social , economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration , and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
We have also formulated our laws and our development , economic and social policies on the basis of the principles of equality and justice and the lofty Islamic shariah , in accordance with the current changes in the international environment and in an attempt to achieve our various national objectives in the social , economic , and cultural fields .  
The Assembly , considering that nuclear testing was not consistent with undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference , deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground nuclear testing and sharing the alarm expressed internationally , regionally and nationally , would strongly deplore all current nuclear testing and urge the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
It also dispatches the strong message to the countries involved in current nuclear testing that the international community neither welcomes nor approves of their outdated , digressive and intolerable behaviour .  
The Secretary-General 's report is a technical compilation of the answers received from some States , without its own input and without the views of so many competent international organizations that are daily preoccupied with current and future developments in the Balkans .  
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
Under the same item , the Commission considered the current status of implementation of General Assembly resolution 47 / 237 on the International Year of the Family and took note of the intention of the Secretary-General to submit to the Assembly , at its fiftieth session , his specific proposals on the follow-up to the International Year of the Family , intended to serve as an indicative guide for action , primarily at the national and local levels .  
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education . 
Stressing the growing importance of the symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development in current international relations , and recognizing the importance of promoting social and economic development and international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ,  
Emphasis should be placed on improving basic data in those series necessary for compiling the major aggregates of the 1993 SNA for the total economy , including estimates of value added by kind of activity and final expenditures on gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices ; gross national income ; gross disposable income ; savings ; and net lending .  
In August 1993 , IMF wrote to ministers of finance , central bank governors and heads of national statistical offices in a number of industrial and developing countries to seek their comments on the terms of reference of the Task Force ; on the role of international organizations in developing standards for finance statistics ; on current arrangements for data collection and sharing ; and on the findings of the questionnaire .  
The Task Force has reviewed current arrangements for the reporting and sharing of finance statistics by international organizations , and notes that there appears to be a considerable and probably increasing degree of data sharing of finance statistics among international organizations , especially through the use of electronic media , which have replaced the use of report forms in the industrial and major developing countries .  
None the less , some of the objectives of the Task Force are being addressed by the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics , which was established in 1992 with a membership of international and national statistical agencies to implement the recommendations contained in two IMF reports : " Report on the measurement of international capital flows " and " Report on the world current account discrepancy " .  
This was a matter dealt with by the World Conference , which recognized the need for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and within the framework of balanced and sustainable development .  
Our Government is more than determined to take the reins of its destiny and lead its people to the brightest , most peaceful and prosperous future that its current limited economic , infrastructural and organizational capacities can provide .  
Stressing also that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance provided in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking humanitarian assistance with economic aid for national reconstruction and development ,  
Invites the working group on the agenda for development to give consideration to the proposal of the Secretary-General that advantage be taken of the presence of high-level representatives during the early part of the sessions of the General Assembly to conduct a dialogue and to convene special sessions of the Assembly on major themes relevant to the current and emerging economic and social issues in the global agenda , including those identified under the agenda for development ;  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
Reiterates its belief that as the United Nations , the embodiment of multilateralism , is uniquely placed to promote a more just , equitable , prosperous and secure world order , it should be strengthened to reflect current political and economic realities and to contribute to enhancing the common welfare on the basis of international cooperation , mutual respect and global partnership ;

The representative stressed that , in order to add a gender dimension to all government policies , the current Government assumed that discrimination against women was not expressed through occasional or partial situations , but rather was systematic and hence required structural and cultural changes .  
As to the financial resources , the representative replied that the process of providing government aid would be a gradual one ; by gradually transforming the current educational system , primary education would become government aided , and university and other forms of tertiary education would be on a cost-sharing basis .  
Members requested detailed statistical data in the subsequent report and asked whether the current legislation was not discriminatory in that it made a distinction between female prostitutes and their male clients .  
Finally , my delegation welcomes the import of operative paragraph 10 of the current draft resolution , concerning the international community 's commitment to assisting and supporting the economic , social and constitutional development in Haiti in recognition of their importance for sustaining a secure and stable environment .  
She assured members of the Committee that , in spite of the current economic and political crisis in the Russian Federation and the sharp reduction in the capacity of the State to achieve the goals set by the Convention , the Government remained dedicated to the goals of women 's advancement and the elimination of discrimination against them and would continue to take measures directed at alleviating the negative impact of transformation on women and improving their economic and social position .  
We can , however , agree to the six-month initial period proposed in the current draft , but only on the understanding that the United Nations is not about to terminate its presence in Angola after only six months , rather , that it is prepared to undertake additional periods of extension , based on actual performance , to enable the political process to take root .  
This massive upsurge of interest is evidently consequent upon a perceived deterioration in social conditions , the incapacity of current paradigms , institutions , policies and programmes to address effectively problems of social development and the earnest desire of Governments to harness national and international strengths to meet these challenges .  
He noted that international justice required independence from the decisions of political organs , and that , in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
In the view of the same representative , by including the word " normally " the Commission had made it clear that the burden of proof lay upon States which wanted to apply the current draft articles to regulate rivers not flowing into a common terminus on the ground that there existed a physical relationship and a unitary whole for the major part of the length of the watercourses .  
In the fifth cycle , a substantial part of the indicative planning figures again went to this sector ( $ 4,790,000 ) ; in the mining sector , UNDP 's objective during the current cycle has been to help the Government mobilize other sources of finance and to attract potential investors with a view to exploiting mineral resources that have already been identified ( with geological maps , by drafting a mining code and publishing information brochures ) .  
Although NATCAP began without a coherent strategy and with a heavy reliance on external inputs , the current generation of NATCAP countries have evolved to a point where there is substantial national content with increased reliance on in-country task forces .

The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
Despite continuing difficulties , a basis had now been laid for a qualitatively new political and psychological climate in the region that opened the way for the peaceful coexistence of Palestinians and Israelis and the attainment of specific results in the current negotiating stage , which was both complex and sensitive . 
Capital spending has been the main engine of growth in the current cycle , with non-residential fixed investment in 1993-1995 rising at annual average rates of close to 14 per cent in real terms .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Fully convinced that an enlarged membership is desirable in order to take advantage of the current propitious international climate to negotiate and conclude , on the solid basis of a more representative participation , a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and other important agreements requiring universal adherence ,  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
Other initiatives which his delegation was presenting to the General Assembly at the current session concerned the protection of minorities , which called for enhanced international cooperation to defuse conflict situations ; attention to the specific needs of children and juveniles in conflict with the law in the context of human rights in the administration of justice ; and the plight of internally displaced persons , in respect of which the work of the Secretary-General 's representative on that question had been crucial .  
Therefore , paragraph 4 of the draft resolution stated that the General Assembly noted with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of indebtedness , stressed that non-payment of undisputed debts reflected badly on the entire diplomatic community , reaffirmed that non-compliance with contractual obligations could not be justified or condoned , and endorsed the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;  
The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
To enable timely procurement of essential goods and services required for new missions and the maintenance of ongoing missions , and in order for the Controller to exercise the authority granted under financial rule 110.6 ( Commitments against the appropriations of current and future financial periods ) , relevant criteria , restrictions and new procedures were introduced during January 1995 to facilitate requests for use of this authority in certain key areas of procurement for peace-keeping operations .  
To provide information , within the Security Commission , on the respective military and public security expenditures approved in their budgets for the current fiscal year , taking as a reference the " Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures " adopted by the United Nations on 12 December 1990 , under the provisions of article 52 ( k ) of this Treaty ; and ,  
To consider the information provided by the Governments on their respective military and security budgets for the current fiscal year and to elaborate joint proposals for the possible adaptation of future budgets , taking into account the internal situation of each State ;  
In its report to me , the team concluded that , in the current context of violence and instability , United Nations guards would not be able to guarantee the security of humanitarian personnel in Burundi ; indeed , in the present environment , the guards could themselves become potential targets for extremist groups , thus intensifying the security problems already faced by the international humanitarian effort .  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
The entire operation , encompassing both the preparation of initial studies and the subsequent review and coordinating work , is , as indicated above , carried out with resources only available after more urgent tasks have been accomplished - a situation which is the result not of a deliberate decision but of necessity , inasmuch as the demands on the Secretariat units concerned are for the most part of a current nature and can not be subordinated to work on the Repertory ;  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
It is apparent from the comparative data provided that over time , changes in the number , scope , scale and complexity of peace-keeping operations , as well as the considerations outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 above , have affected and rendered less meaningful the pragmatic validity of the current methodology and funding formula for the support account and its ability to generate a sufficient , assured and stable level of resources , which is necessary to support essential backstopping functions at Headquarters .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
My country welcomes the Secretary-General 's current report , which some contains very positive and encouraging elements regarding the United Nations Mission in Haiti and congratulates UNMIH for the progress achieved during the fulfilment of its mandate , as set out in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) , to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a safe and stable climate , to protect international personnel and essential installations , to ensure the desired conditions for the holding of elections and to create a new professional police force .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
While it was clearly stated in the draft resolution as presented that the request for additional meeting time for the Committee should be considered by the General Assembly within the overall existing budget framework , the Secretariat was obliged to make a statement on financial implications in view of the current financial situation faced by the Organization , namely , that : " In adopting the programme budget for 1996-1997 , the General Assembly decided that savings of $ 103.9-million were to be achieved in the programme budget during the biennium .  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
The Government of Guatemala considers that the foregoing reaffirms the mutual trust between the parties that characterizes the current phase of the negotiations , and reiterates its commitment to achieve as soon as possible a negotiated political solution to the internal armed confrontation , in order to strengthen the building of a firm and lasting peace .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
While the United Nations system continues to provide technical cooperation assistance and advisory services of a neutral and non-commercial nature in the field of mineral resources at the request of Member States , its ability to do so has been severely diminished owing to evolutions in the funding of technical cooperation activities , and current budgetary reductions and the financial situation in the United Nations Secretariat .  
The Committee may wish to consider these new approaches and perhaps recommend additional paths to pursue as regards the environmentally sound development of mineral resources for the purposes of implementing activities in the area of mineral resources , given the current budgetary constraints under which United Nations organizations are operating and pursuant to their specific mandates . 
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
The growth and the current vast size of the international capital markets , along with the ease of capital mobility across borders , have come to exert considerable influence on national monetary and exchange rate policies , occasionally threatening the stability of either one or the other .  
In its resolution 1995 / 27 , section II , the Council requested the Secretary-General to consider the feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national legislation in crime prevention and criminal justice and its implementation , taking into account the current and planned capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network and the activities of other United Nations entities and relevant intergovernmental organizations .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
The requested oral report on the status of an interregional workshop to formulate a pilot project ( for an appropriate region ) which should develop standard approaches to the identification and qualitative assessment of permissive tracts and be based on geographical information system technology , that would allow integration with other land management information will not be presented due to the current financial situation of the United Nations , which has prevented the workshop from being financed and prepared . 
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
In addition , the documents were prepared on the following subjects : protection aspects of UNHCR activities on behalf of internally displaced persons ; comprehensive and regional approaches to refugee problems ; recommendations of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) / UNHCR Symposium on Refugees and forced Population Displacements in Africa ; and the scope of international protection in mass influx ; as well as a note on current UNHCR activities on behalf of stateless persons .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
In keeping with the options I outlined in my report to the Council of 19 January 1996 , and pursuant to resolution 1042 ( 1996 ) , I sent a technical team last month to examine the current functions of the MINURSO military component and to determine whether its size could be reduced , while still permitting it to play an effective role in monitoring the cease-fire and verifying allegations of violations . 
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
It would be an illusion to think that this innovative model of peace-keeping will be able to succeed in Liberia , especially under current conditions , unless sufficient and reliable sources of funding are provided to ECOMOG , and unless the force is strengthened and structured in a manner that will enable it to carry out its tasks as a professional peace-keeping force .  
SORIEUL ( International Trade Law Branch ) said the text of subparagraph ( b ) would be retained in its current form ; the Guide would be amended to indicate that the definition of EDI included the manual exchange of electronic data on diskettes , provided the data was structured in a format agreed upon by the parties .  
At the same time , the financial benefits of common premises are not evident in all cases , particularly if a move into joint premises can not fully accommodate all operational requirements , or if various current premises are provided by the Government free of charge as part of its in-kind contribution to the organizations , or if opportunities for appropriate premises are scarce and initial costs of moving are significant .  
The unsatisfactory housing situation was attributed to a number of constraints , including the lack of a national housing policy and implementation strategy reflecting current and prospective economic realities , inadequate delivery of land for housing , the lack of financial mechanisms that cater to the needs of the low - and middle-income groups , and high construction costs in relation to incomes .  
ECLAC studies in international trade , transportation and the financing of development focused on the design of policies and mechanisms to foster the continued expansion and improvement of the commercial linkages of Latin America and the Caribbean with the changing world economy , particularly in view of the current trends towards globalization in production and increasing liberalization of trade and finance .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
Moreover , while the refusal to allow Argentine citizens to reside in the Malvinas Islands dated back more than a century , the current policy barring the immigration of Argentines reinforced the long-time and persistent policy of denying the entry of Argentine residents and capital , in contrast to the international trend towards regional integration and the free movement of persons , including in conflict areas .  
While these figures are lower than in previous cycles , they should not be construed as indicative of future trends , but rather as a temporary phenomenon , reflecting UNDP efforts to reposition itself to become a more responsive and effective organization as it adapts to current development realities and challenges .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
With regard to the progress that has been made since registration in relation to exploration , it is proposed that a workshop / seminar be convened to assess the current state of deep seabed mineral exploration with a view to determining if there are any outstanding technical issues to be overcome as well as to provide the Authority with a clear set of guidelines for work that may be expected of a contractor in a plan of work for exploration approved in the form of a contract ( stage I of the exploration plan ) . 
In any event , this objective will have to be pursued while preserving the current capacity of the text-processing units to ensure the timely issuance of documentation in all languages simultaneously , working with generally very short deadlines and operating within the present framework of reduced staff resources and drastic limitations in the use of overtime .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements , prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management , shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .  Today I received a copy of a message sent by the Government of Burundi to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , inviting them to increase the number of human rights observers , since the current Government ,  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The health issues included in the Platform for Action were already part of the Ninth General Programme of Work of WHO and technical programmes have continued with their activities as planned although , given current resource constraints , substantial additional funding is not anticipated .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
Activities being initiated include reviewing the current state of interpreting modelling work for sustainable development ; formulating recommendations for improving existing integrated modelling work for sustainable development ; developing a linked set of models for integrated global and regional assessments of sustainable development ; stimulating the development and use of integrated models in developing countries ; and providing support to relevant activities of different bodies . 
While the eradication strategy relied heavily on the use of insecticides to reduce or interrupt malaria transmission and attempted to eliminate infection through case detection and treatment , using the same approaches in all areas , the current strategy aims to control malaria disease through early diagnosis and prompt treatment , including improving the management of severe and complicated malaria , controlling epidemics and using preventive measures that are locally effective and sustainable .  
In its request for a legal study , the Advisory Committee envisaged a two-stage process : an examination of current procedures on the basis of which the Secretary-General , in the course of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , would develop and propose means of ensuring a simple , efficient and prompt settlement of third-party claims , of limiting the liability of the Organization , protecting its interests and allowing for a coordinated approach of all United Nations organizations , agencies and programmes .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
If steps are not taken to curb the fighting , then the current situation in the West Bank , which has turned into a grim confrontation between organized forces , may do immeasurable damage to the already shaky efforts for a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region .  
The strengthening of the monitoring , internal audit , inspection and evaluation , and investigation functions provided for in the resolution is an important and integral part of the Secretary-General 's management plan , as outlined in his current and his previous annual reports on the work of the Organization , and is all the more essential at a time of major resource constraints .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
With the increased level of insecurity producing newly displaced persons daily , the United Nations system remains concerned that current stockpiles will be depleted and major shortages of essential relief items will soon occur .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
The recommendation in paragraph 50 of the Committee 's report , to the effect that in future scales of assessment , all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum rate of 0.001 per cent , should be implemented as soon as possible .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
In the current circumstances of technical cooperation , when the demand for traditional longer-term expert assignments is decreasing while rapid-response short-term specialized consultancies are preferred , the Department is of the view that recruitment practices should not be excessively rigid .  
Some delegations , noting the current tight resource environment for multilateral development , supported the position of the Advisory Committee for Administrative and Budgetary Questions ( ACABQ ) that the additional requirements for the establishment of the country office in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the revised 1996-1997 budget , should have been absorbed within currently appropriated budgetary resources .  
Mr . MAHUGU ( Kenya ) , after endorsing the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that while current economic indicators revealed widespread world economic growth , with the developing countries having registered an aggregate GDP growth of over 5 per cent , that growth rate concealed sharp regional , subregional and national differences .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
In closing , he said that , although the current climate of stability and economic progress was promising , it would not be lasting unless it served to open opportunities for all persons and that the crucial link between economic and social development and the efforts to enhance the dignity of mankind made the Fund 's work a truly meaningful task .  
However , CPC had been unable to reach agreement on the content of that document at its session in June 1996 and had recommended that the Secretary-General be asked to present to the current session of the General Assembly , through CPC at its September session , a short and concise document to be considered for inclusion in the proposed medium-term plan based on relevant resolutions and decisions of intergovernmental bodies and taking into account the views expressed by the members of CPC .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
It is important that an effective mechanism be established , so that international actors and the authorities can discuss issues of common concern on a regular basis , share information on current activities and take joint decisions , especially on how best to meet the needs of vulnerable groups .  
While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .  
That being said , it was obvious that there were still dramatic variations between regions , and the question was whether the current relatively robust growth in the developing countries as a whole would translate itself into a widespread improvement of living conditions and especially into poverty reduction worldwide . 
With respect to article 4 of the Convention , and in the light of the current difficult economic situation , the Committee emphasizes the importance of the allocation of resources to the maximum extent possible for the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights of the child at both central and local levels , in accordance with the principles of the Convention , in particular those relating to non-discrimination and the best interests of the child ( arts . 2 and 3 ) .  
The current period has been particularly important for this new international organization : the principal organs of the Authority - the Assembly , the 36-member Council and the Secretariat - have all been established , together with the subsidiary expert bodies , and the organizational work required to assume the substantive functions entrusted to the Authority by Part XI of the Convention and by the 1994 Agreement has been initiated .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
The dispute settlement mechanism provided for in those articles represented a bold step forward in the progressive development of international law , for the doctrine on dispute settlement had traditionally been based on consent to or free choice of means of settlement , whereas the current text made recourse to conciliation compulsory if either party rejected the other options .  
I have the honour to inform you that an extraordinary session of the central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution at ministerial level was held today , 11 November 1996 , at Addis Ababa to consider the current crisis in the Great Lakes region with special reference to eastern Zaire .  
New , often very complex tasks in insecure living / working environments , especially for staff employed by humanitarian agencies , and mobility in both function and location are the main features of the current work of the international civil service .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
INCERA ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group 77 and China , said that the strengthening of oversight and audit functions was a fundamental means of achieving the efficient , transparent and responsible management of the Organization 's resources , particularly in the light of the current financial crisis .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at the 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
It is committed , independent of extreme events , to combat racism and xenophobia over the long term , producing publications ( brochures , posters and pamphlets ) every year on symbolic dates such as 21 March ( International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ) , 3 October ( German Unity Day ) and 10 December ( Human Rights Day ) , suggesting action to be taken , engaging in public relations , through statements in the press , on current topics , and submitting petitions and claims to political bodies .  
Phase 1 contains basic gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices , broken down by final expenditure and kind of economic activity .  
The Department of Public Prosecutions is taking the measures necessary to strengthen and develop the Office by increasing the number of its staff , providing it with an adequate number of highly qualified and experienced personnel to ensure the rapid performance of the administrative work concerning current cases in question being handled by the Office , and providing it with the modern technology in order to facilitate the collection and publication of statistics required for the serious monitoring of those cases .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
Bearing in mind that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to address the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking , inter alia , resettlement to reintegration programmes in order to strengthen further the process of national reconstruction and development ,  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
The following questions arose concerning the current system : the extent to which placement and promotion were tied to merit ; whether the promotion process could be improved to reward performance ; how open decision-making was in that area ; what changes were practical and desirable in policies and procedures ; whether the functioning of the appointment and promotion bodies could be improved ; and whether programme managers could be held more accountable for placement and promotion decisions .  
In this context , he felt sure that delegations had come to the current session of the Board not to fulfil routine representational formalities but , stimulated and motivated by the in-depth and solid analytical reports prepared by the secretariat , to hold a serious dialogue on issues that were of primary concern to their policy-makers .  
Developing countries ' growing leverage in the global trade system was based on raw economic power : they currently accounted for a quarter of world trade and , if current trends continued , this figure could reach 40 per cent by the year 2010 and over half by 2020 .  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
On the question whether the scope of the draft articles should be extended to include other activities not prohibited by international law that did not involve the risk of significant transboundary harm but that nevertheless caused such harm , her delegation considered that , at the current stage in the progressive development of international law , the draft articles should cover all situations that might entail the strict liability of States for lawful acts .  
Letter dated 20 November 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Zimbabwe to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General , transmitting a joint communiqu entitled " The current international trading system and prospects for the promotion of trade among developing countries " , released at the sixth meeting of the Summit Level Group of Developing Countries , held at Harare from 3 to 5 November 1996 ( A / C . 2 / 51 / 10 ) .  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
These criteria are set out in the current criteria for assignment and promotion published in administrative instruction ST / AI / 413 , which provide , inter alia , that paramount consideration must be given to performance , competence , efficiency and demonstrated potential to perform at the higher level .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
On the other hand , it has been strongly emphasized that the establishment of networks of existing small scientific facilities should also be high on the agenda for strengthening international cooperation , particularly in geomagnetic studies , electrojet current measurements , solar photometry , astrometry , galactic mapping and optical astronomy .  
A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
It is incumbent upon the international community to make a concerted effort to make sure that the Greek Cypriot side abandons its current confrontational posture before it is too late , and starts engaging in meaningful dialogue with the Turkish Cypriot side , within the framework of your good offices mission , in the interest of a peaceful solution in Cyprus .  
Revisions were made to improve data quality in the following items : ( i ) data on " children ever born " and " children living " should be collected by sex ; ( ii ) " date of birth of the last child born alive " was introduced to replace " live births within the 12 months preceding the census " to measure current fertility ; and ( iii ) " deaths in the 12 months preceding the census " was added to measure current mortality .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Some delegations expressed their thanks to JIU for preparing an excellent study and described it as a high-quality analytical document , as well as a valuable and timely contribution to the current restructuring process in the economic , social and related fields of activity of the United Nations system .  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
In view of the current serious situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , the Committee intends to encourage renewed , intensified efforts by non-governmental organizations to organize and coordinate sustained campaigns in order to inform public opinion and to promote national and international action in support of United Nations resolutions and the Committee 's objectives .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
From 1995 to the present SELA has accomplished a fundamental reorientation and adaptation in order to achieve two main objectives : first , to help the 27 members become integrated into the current international environment and , secondly , to coordinate their agendas for regional , hemispheric and international actions .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
All of these factors combined make it vitally important that the international community mobilize its efforts to achieve a rapid settlement while continuing to provide needed humanitarian and material assistance in other words , we need a comprehensive strategy for rehabilitation to go with the current ongoing efforts to settle the problem of Afghanistan .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
A paradox arises in that , while globalization may be considered desirable because of the potential beneficial effects on national economic growth , at the same time , current levels of growth and dynamism in a particular economy may determine whether the effects of globalization are positive or negative .  
Inspired by the purposes and principles of the Damascus Declaration , and on the basis of the role played by member States in promoting Arab solidarity , advancing the interests of the Arab nation and safeguarding joint national security ; in response to current requirements , and in the light of international and regional developments , particularly with regard to the peace process , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs affirmed their absolute commitment to work in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Arab Summit Conference held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June 1996 .  
The Conference welcomes the fact that the United Nations approaches racism by examining incidents characteristic of contemporary forms of racism , incidents which unfortunately seem to be on the rise throughout the world , aggravated by economic and social problems and the current universal decline in moral standards .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
The current approach to energy policy worldwide , which is characterized by a strong emphasis on energy supply , without regard to its social , economic and environmental consequences , does not meet the requirements of sustainable development .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .  
In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
It was agreed that technical experts , including experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , should be invited to the fifteenth session of the Working Group , in 1998 , in order to identify and study the current international technical standards pertinent to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .  
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
Having completed its preliminary consideration of the legal issues and possible provisions to be considered in uniform rules on digital signatures , as reflected in part II of the present report , the Working Group noted that , for lack of sufficient time , it could not enter into any detailed discussion of the issues of incorporation by reference at the current session . 
The Director , DAMR , is concerned that the authorized level of resources are not sufficient to meet his current audit and oversight responsibilities within acceptable professional standards of an average cycle of once every five to seven years .  
The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .  
He agreed that periodic reviews of the Model Law would be desirable because of the particular nature of the subject matter and the rapid technical changes that could be expected ; for that same reason it would also be useful for the current text to be described as the " 1996 version " of the Model Law .  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
In part , this would be due to rising income and per capita consumption , overall export growth , moderate inflation and modest current account deficits projected for South , East and South-East Asian countries . 6 To some extent , it can be anticipated that there will be a further intensification of regional cooperation within the various institutional arrangements currently in existence .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .

While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
At the current stage of geological and geotechnical knowledge of the site , there are favourable prospects for the technical feasibility of the proposed tunnels at an acceptable level of assurance , this being understood in the context of the practical needs for detailed information and the practical difficulties of meeting those needs through off-shore surveying .  
At the beginning of the current decade , economic growth proved to be lower than projected in the baseline economic growth scenario , which was drawn up in the light of the trends observed during the period 1980-1990 and on which the traffic projections are based .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Noting that the current , severe maldistribution of income prevents millions from enjoying economic and social rights and that gross inequalities prevent social harmony , Mr . Eide added that the focus of his report was rather on the impact of different structures of international and national income distribution on human rights . 
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
An extensive debate encompassing a wide range of secular and religious views was in fact under way concerning assisted reproduction ; the current restrictions had been introduced by the previous Government .  
The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .  
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
Senior staff of the Buildings Management Service inspected the current office arrangements and acknowledged that there was a need for additional office space ; however , they also indicated that the Fund 's requests had to be considered in the context of the amount of space required and the desired location ( the main Secretariat building ) , and the competing requests from United Nations departments and offices for contiguous space for their operations .  
Recognizing , however , the importance of agricultural development no only for people living in rural areas but as an engine of growth , the Bank had formulated during the past year a new action plan for rural development , designed to address current problems and to provide a new and dynamic framework for future Bank activities in that area .  The plan had just been presented to the Bank 's Board of Directors .  
Those elements included the improvement of current bilateral transit agreements , the promotion of a complementary comprehensive subregional agreement and international transit conventions and agreements , the development of alternative routes , the commercialization of transit services and the development of potential for expanded subregional trade .  
I have the honour to transmit to you herewith decision 001 / 97 , dated 19 July 1997 , whereby the Constitutional Council of the Republic of the Congo , noting that it was impossible for the Government to organize the presidential elections scheduled for 27 July 1997 , decided to postpone such elections and , accordingly , to extend the mandate of the current President of the Republic until the proclamation of a successor elected by universal suffrage , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution in force in the Republic of the Congo .  
First , at no stage previously had all the available information on the issue been assembled for comparison and review ; second , no thorough study of the applicable United Nations Staff Rules had been undertaken to assist in the determination of whether the case was one of an actual conflict of interest or rather an apparent conflict of interest reflecting a common-sense application of just and reasonable behaviour ; third , the report must be detailed and legalistic to allow the United Nations to understand the insufficient nature of the current conflict of interest rules .  
It should be easy to understand why the Government of the Republic of Burundi objects to the talks being held in the United Republic of Tanzania , the fundamental reason for this objection being the current tension resulting from the problems caused by the refugee camps set up all along the shared border by the United Republic of Tanzania , just a dozen or so kilometres from Burundi , which are regularly used as bases for bloody incursions into Burundi territory . 
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
There are effective family planning programmes , with universal coverage and no account taken of marital status or whether the relationship is stable , although they could be better if we have available enough different types of contraceptive for each case , and in sufficient quantities ; supply is a problem under current economic circumstances . 
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
The mission focused on balancing real radiological risks against economic , social and psychological problems , and generating together with the authorities of the concerned countries realistic projects with a high likelihood of success , leading to measurable improvements in the current conditions under which the population was living .  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
The Commission also recalled that the current level of the ceiling ( 25 per cent of net salary ) was based on an administrative decision and that a reduction of the ceiling would be beneficial to duty stations with a large non-pensionable component since a lesser proportion of income would be considered non-pensionable and the relationship between income while in service and income after service would improve . 
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
The Dominican Republic attaches special importance to the ongoing reform process , given that it is capable , while respecting the principles and purposes that gave birth to the Organization , of ensuring a more democratic , transparent , representative and efficient system capable of facing the current challenges , especially those of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the peoples of the world .  
In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
The debate and negotiations that took place during the three sessions of the Working Group held in 1997 covered , in a balanced way , the substantive and diverse issues included in both clusters , and demonstrated the complexity of this process of reform which , despite opposing interests , the vast majority of Member States hope will produce a Security Council that represents the current composition of the Organization and effectively responds to the future challenges of the United Nations .  
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
Those who are familiar with Central American history and aware of our current efforts in the various fields of integration know that Central American union is not simply an act of faith ; it is , rather , a work of engineering , an enormous undertaking that , taking into account the unique qualities of each of our States , is the key to the exercise of joint sovereignty .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close . 
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .  
Her Government 's approach to advancing gender equality was based on the recognition that gender was a factor in the nation 's current social , economic , cultural and political systems and that the unequal status of women had its genesis in and was perpetuated by systemic causes . 
In view of its coordinating role , the Commission called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services of the Secretariat , the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , also as part of current programmes in the field of good governance and institution-building , utilizing the expertise of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
The emergence of an active biochemical prospecting market can provide an additional means of converting the potential future value of biodiversity into current income for those most responsible for , and most affected by , the preservation of biologically diverse ecosystems .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
The assessment team meets with interested parties , both governmental and non-governmental , in close cooperation with the United Nations Resident Coordinator , United Nations agencies and programmes , as well as local donors , and compiles detailed information on current policies , legislation , and human and financial capacities in key areas .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
The recent statement of Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterating Israel 's absolute sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Jewish people which will never again be divided typifies the uncompromising and brazen attitude of the present Israeli leadership , not the statesmanship that would have been more appropriate , and that is expected of it in the current delicate situation .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in those areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , particularly in developing countries .  
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
A list of the 27 agreements of continuing validity , current as at 27 November , appears in annex I . Taken together with the provisions of the Croatian Constitution , those agreements , for which the Government of Croatia has made itself internationally accountable , provide a comprehensive political and institutional framework of guarantees , which , if fully implemented , will allow the people of the region to exercise freely their rights and obligations as equal citizens of Croatia . 
At least at the current stage of the Commissions work on the topic , the functional protection extended by international organizations towards their agents should be considered along with diplomatic protection per se , since the initial results would supply the clarification needed for the subsequent adoption of a final decision on the inclusion of functional protection .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
The United Nations Security Coordinator formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Organization on current and potential security-related problems and is responsible for coordinating , planning and implementing inter-agency security and safety programmes and for acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation . 
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
Some delegations expressed their thanks to JIU for preparing an excellent study and described it as a high-quality analytical document , as well as a valuable and timely contribution to the current restructuring process in the economic , social and related fields of activity of the United Nations system .  
It is of the utmost importance that the Commission be granted the necessary financial means to start operating as soon as possible , in order to maintain the current momentum in favour of clarifying the past so that the country can move forward in the daunting tasks of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and , in the informal sector , as workers in free-trade zones , as prostitutes or as overseas contract workers .  
The GM would pursue two elements in this regard : ( i ) information on current and future aggregate flows will be collected from recipients and sources ; and ( ii ) information on potential sources of finance , and how to access these , will be packaged for easy use by customers .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
This part of the study , which deals solely with economic , social and cultural rights , concerns all current or recent violations of those rights and of so _ called collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment , irrespective of their perpetrators , whether States or their agents , groups of States , national or international private organizations or individuals or groups acting outside the competence of the State .  
It may be inferred from the current case law of the international legal bodies that the basis for determining the amount and nature of the compensation is not solely the physical or material injury or damage but also the direct or indirect moral injury .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
These included the improvement of current bilateral transit agreements , the promotion of a complementary comprehensive subregional agreement and international transit conventions and agreements , the development of alternative routes , the commercialization of transit services and the development of the potentials for expanded subregional trade .  
Its current social security scheme was undergoing a period of complex reforms and unemployment insurance was being developed , with emphasis on the promotion of economic activity of the unemployed in small towns and in rural areas , as well as the disabled .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
Without an effort of that scope and significance , and without a solution to such fundamental problems as the external debt of the African countries , the vast majority of those countries would be unable to overcome the difficulties arising from their current critical economic situation and the accumulation of serious social problems caused by marginalization .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .  
The Forum recognized the region 's vulnerability to natural disasters , environmental damage and unlawful challenges to national integrity and independence and reaffirmed its commitment to take a comprehensive , integrated and collaborative approach to maintaining and strengthening current mechanisms for cooperation among members in dealing with threats to the security , broadly defined , of States in the region and of the region as a whole .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
Similarly , the Department 's publication , Image &amp; amp ; Reality , the single publication devoted to help correct common misconceptions about the United Nations , has been thoroughly revised to counter criticisms about the Organization , both in specific areas such as peacekeeping and more generally as part of current debate over reform .  
National coordinating agencies will receive guidance and advice in mobilizing private-sector investment , conducting feasibility studies , developing marketing strategies , identifying effective credit schemes , organizing international round tables , negotiating debt swaps and assisting national authorities seeking extensions or enlargement of current international preferential trade arrangements for selected Andean exports . 
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
Much concern has been expressed about the devastating social consequences of the current financial crisis , particularly massive unemployment , the loss of health and educational services , and the consequent increase in poverty in affected countries .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .  
The unlawful acts committed in respect of all materials or items covered by the current draft also include unlawful acts committed in respect of nuclear material in peaceful use the subject matter covered by the Physical Protection Convention .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
During their extended phase , all current projects would continue to address several common themes and issues critical to enhancing impact at the grass-roots level and improving the living conditions of poor and disadvantaged people .  
Another attractive feature of the ARGOS system is the small transmitters : the average daily electric current required is as low as a few milliamperes ; miniaturized models can be as compact as a small matchbox , weighing as little as 20 grams .  
The forward rate would be free to differ from the current spot rate and a growing forward discount on the spot exchange rate ( assuming interest rates remained unchanged ) would be an indication of expected future depreciation of the spot rate .  
For the medium term , his delegation supported calls for the development of a new international financial system based on increased accountability and global governance arrangements that were in keeping with the needs of the current globalized economy .  
The current financial turmoil , coming in the wake of the Mexican crisis , had exposed the inadequacy of existing institutions at the national and international levels , particularly in dealing with short-term capital flows .  
At the meetings , which took place in a friendly and businesslike atmosphere , current problems in the prospects for bilateral relations were discussed , and an exchange of views was held on regional and international issues of mutual interest .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
Countries at level 1 are characterized by compiling gross domestic product at current and constant prices , broken down by kind of economic activity and final expenditure .  
While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
The current steady and dynamic development of political , trade and economic relations would be unthinkable without the strengthening of fraternal , trusting and mutually advantageous relations of partnership between all States of the Silk Road region .  
The consequences of the current repressive approach not only affect the immediate humanitarian situation , they also have a direct and major adverse impact on the prospects for a just and lasting political solution .  
The team recommended that no further verification of Iraq 's current biological weapons full , final and complete disclosure be conducted at the senior international expert level , until Iraq commits itself to provide substantive , new information .  
Before the crisis , economic orthodoxy had held that a current account deficit was acceptable and sustainable if it stemmed from investment as opposed to consumption and if it was a result of private sector activities .  
There are many obstacles to resolving the acute problems and to raising public awareness of the need to protect the environment during the current period of financial difficulties and economic instability coupled with poverty and weak discipline .  
He said that the current economic outlook for Africa was not encouraging , as the region was suffering from the effects of the international financial crisis , reduced export demand and falling commodity prices .  
It was also stated that for a number of developing countries there was still a crucial need for continued ODA flows since the current levels of trade and foreign investment could not provide for their essential needs , including basic infrastructure .  
In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
The fact that Ethiopia started this current offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of the current offensive contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it .  
The fact that Ethiopia started this offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it , ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of its current offensive .  
On the contrary , Japan was of the view that , despite the changes in the world economy , the institutions which had been established at Bretton Woods had played a vital role in containing the current crisis and that , far from scrapping them , the international community should concentrate on improving them so that they could perform the functions which they were expected to perform in the new global economy .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
Follow-up action has focused on the preparation of teaching materials and the translation of the United Nations standards on criminal justice in the national language for law enforcement officials , examining current penal and banking legislation and creating an effective implementing mechanism , strengthening analytical and operational capabilities , improving inter-ministerial cooperation and enhancing international mutual assistance . 
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52 / 227 , requested the Secretary-General to take appropriate action to reduce the dependency on the current contractor and to ensure that a comprehensive programme for IMIS training is included as part of the ongoing training programme , and that adequate and qualified staff are assigned to the implementation and operation of the system at all duty stations .  
As we know full well , current armed conflicts almost always reflect historical accumulations of unsatisfied demands , in most cases aggravated by inadequate social and economic situations and by international political and economic conditions .  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
Generally speaking , however , the current extent and types of protected areas , particularly in densely populated regions , are deemed insufficient to achieve sustainable forest management due to both internal and external factors .  
Request countries , with the support of international organizations , particularly UNEP and the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , to make a comprehensive assessment of the current status of protected forest areas , including total number , extent of each area , objectives of establishment , effectiveness of management , IUCN system equivalent category , and basic biological and social information available ; 
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
Until the causes of the current vulnerability of the international economy were determined , it should not be forgotten that the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the implementation of far-reaching institutional reforms were essential for the achievement of comprehensive and equitable social and economic progress .  
The Committee is still concerned , however , that the current data _ collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
His country therefore welcomed the outcome of the intensive negotiations held in September and October 1998 and was convinced that the current draft convention represented a positive development with respect to the international communitys endeavours to prepare a universally accepted instrument to curb or eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism .  There were , however , a number of issues that needed to be clarified and settled .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .  
In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
Proceeding from strategic objectives formulated in the programmes adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women and from the countrys current state of economic and social development , the Government convened in March 1996 a national forum on women in social development , with a view to upgrading the level of competence , living conditions , education , qualification and culture of Mongolian women and to expanding their involvement in development and progress .  
Being cognizant of the importance of focusing upon the family , which is the primary unit of any society , and on economic entities in the fight against poverty , the Government orients its activities towards changing the current inert status of poor families living below the poverty line , as mere recipients of aid .  
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .

They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .

As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
For many transition economies , the scale of restructuring required by the shift from central planning to competitive markets is so large that the domestic economic , political and social institutions , which are also in a state of transition , are unable to cope with the adjustment costs , which in turn may generate large-scale resistance to reform ( the study of Romania in the current Survey provides a telling example of this ) .  
The 1999 World Survey provides a synoptic and statistical outline of the current economic and social status of women and of some emerging trends in the 12 critical areas of concern of the Platform for Action . 2 Based on existing data , it highlights the areas where visible progress has been achieved , compared to the situation three decades ago .

In many countries , the United Nations ( resident coordinator / UNDP resident representative ) , the World Bank or often the two together convene meetings with donor and national government representatives to exchange information on current and planned programmes and discuss critical policy issues .  In some countries which use the consultative group mechanism , the resident coordinator chairs regular meetings of locally represented donors , while the World Bank convenes the consultative group itself .  
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .

Secondly , such a narrow definition of treaties and treaty-making would impede ( or even preclude ) any proper account of indigenous views on these issues , simply because of the widely _ held rationale that indigenous peoples are not States in the current sense of the term in international law , regardless of their generally recognized status as sovereign entities in the era of the Law of Nations .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
Having completed his research , the Special Rapporteur considers that it may be useful to review the above list , so as to determine - at least provisionally - what would be the most practical and fruitful means ( i.e . treaty / agreement renegotiation and / or proper implementation , constructive arrangement , resort to international bodies , or some other formula ) of constructively approaching , in the future , the wide array of current situations confronting those peoples mentioned above .  
During short-term microgravity experiments on board aeroplanes , research will be conducted on the correlation between the electrophoretic direct current field and the variable gravity field with electrophoretic instruments for continuous free current stream in space and equipment for life science experiments on manned space missions will be developed and relevant scientific research initiated .  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,

These limited opportunities had largely been due to the fact that a significant portion of market access opportunities had been allocated to pre-selected countries , which were historical exporter countries ( according to the current access opportunity provision ) and / or countries that received preferential treatment under regional or bilateral trade preferences ; and the TRQ system had not been administered transparently and had been inefficient in achieving the full utilization of TRQs . 
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
The common overall objective among developing countries in the next negotiations , experts agreed , was to maximize the potential benefits to developing countries from the continuation of agricultural reform in the multilateral framework by correcting perceived shortcomings of the current Agreement which seemingly put developing countries at a disadvantage in international agricultural trade .  
This requires addressing difficult and controversial issues such as schoolgirl pregnancy , adaptation of the content of educational curricula and textbooks to the objective of equipping girls with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to avoid early pregnancy , and broadening the objectives and purposes of education to provide the future generations of women in Uganda with options unavailable to the past and current generations of women .  
Accelerating current initiatives and [ taking / adopting United States ] additional actions to reduce substantially the debts of [ developing countries , particularly United States would delete ] the heavily indebted low-income countries , [ by speeding up the process , by relaxing the eligibility criteria and by broadening and deepening / improving and enhancing existing measures within the current framework of Japan ] the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative ;  
In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
The main objectives outlined in the 1999 consolidated appeal process are to prevent the current humanitarian emergency situation in southern and central Somalia from developing into a dramatic famine , and to continue to foster stability , self-reliance and security in the north .  
Furthermore , participants in the conference considered that the current and future international trade agenda , such as the upcoming negotiations on trade in services , was of crucial importance for the partnership between the public and private sectors in both originating and destination countries .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
An expeditious accession process for the least developed countries which were not members of WTO , on terms consistent with their status , was seen as an integral part of their efforts to reverse their current marginalization in world trade and to become integrated into the world economy and international trading system .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
In this regard , it stressed that the current forms of cooperation involving the public and private sectors of developing countries should be built upon and expanded , and also stressed the importance of identifying barriers and restrictions to the transfer of publicly and privately owned technologies .  
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
In the current stage of global developments , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
Within its current severe financial and staffing constraints , the Institute has been able to implement a modest but promising substantive programme of work , thus demonstrating its institutional potential and proving its capability to fulfil its unique role in pursuit of the advancement of women and gender equality .  
The current political context , however , is unfavourable , particularly since those elected will in all likelihood be disinclined to take part in such a seminar until the elections have been held and parliamentary commissions established .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
At the current level of knowledge , the problem is still very much open-ended ; the available methodological approaches do not provide straightforward and unequivocal assessments ; and in the absence of sound and indisputable estimates , the level of subjective judgement is often above an acceptable threshold .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
Nor can we overlook the fact that the current unjust and unsustainable international economic order continues to treat Africa as an economically undeveloped source of natural wealth , that serves the unsustainable consumption patterns of industrialized countries , among which are included the former colonizers .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
Commodities continue to provide an important economic starting base : they have a high value-added component ; agricultural commodities are an important source of employment and offer scope for anti-poverty campaigns ; and agriculture frequently acts as a buffer against economic problems and allows the return to rural areas of urban unemployed , as in the current crisis .  
In particular , given the unsatisfactory nutritional situation prevalent in Iraq and the necessity of providing a full food basket on a monthly basis , and also taking into account the effects of the current drought , it is essential to keep under constant review the funding level of the food sector .  
The report of the second panel concerning the current humanitarian situation in Iraq ( S / 1999 / 356 , annex II ) , had referred to the qualitative dimension of the impact of the sanctions and to the cumulative effects of sustained deprivation on the psychosocial cohesion of the Iraqi population as indicated by an increase in juvenile delinquency , begging and prostitution , anxiety about the future and lack of motivation , and a rising sense of isolation .  
Expressed appreciation to the countries that participated in the current round of reviews ; to the senior officials from capitals who engaged in open , frank and meaningful dialogue and shared valuable experience with other Governments - - which could also benefit from the process - - and to the international private sector ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
Although the current scale of assessments had been blamed by some for the Organizations financial difficulties , that scale had been based on extensive negotiations among all Member States and had proved to be fair and reasonable in practice , since it basically reflected the Members capacity to pay .  
In general , however , the current international situation was propitious for enhanced economic cooperation between nations and a more determined effort to eliminate the many obstacles still standing in the way of the growth and progress of the developing countries .  
While considerable progress had been made towards the development of an open , non-discriminatory , secure , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system , much remained to be done ; his country , which was heavily dependent on foreign trade , had suffered greatly from the remaining inequities in the current system .  
Without an increase in development assistance funding , it would be impossible to meet all the current major challenges ranging from international debt , education and health to access to knowledge for the promotion of economic and social development .  
The scale of the financing required ruled out the possibility of continuing the current practice of making voluntary contributions on an ad hoc basis ; a more reasonable and transparent formula for sharing the burden would be needed .  
Providing organizations the opportunity to indicate whether they could absorb the costs of the activities being requested within current and / or successive programmes of work and budget , or whether such activities could only be carried out if additional financing was provided , would avoid the risk of diversion of resources or staff time from the programme of work and budget approved by its governing bodies , while contributing to more consistent and coherent governance by Member States .  
On one of the current sticking points the transboundary movement of living modified organisms intended for consumption or transformation her Government advocated a differentiated solution taking account of the constraints of the international market and the particular situation of developing countries .  
In order to ensure that the benefits of globalization were enjoyed by all countries , rich and poor , it was essential to adopt and promote a multilateral approach by reshaping the current structure of the existing international institutions and their regulatory mechanisms . 
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
While noting that the dimension of the IDP crisis in Colombia has turned into an overwhelming challenge for the Government , national and international participants profoundly lamented the IDP populations current situation of insufficient access to food , shelter , clothing and medical care and called upon the Government to expedite these basic services .  
It should be noted that the current proposal to include mine action in the assessed budget of the peacekeeping mission is specific to the situation in Kosovo , and the adoption of this principle will not affect or change the way in which existing mine action programmes supported by the United Nations are funded , generally through voluntary contributions to established trust funds .  
The initiative was the Equalitarian Parliament , a two-day event in the National Parliament , and within the context of the European Campaign for the European Parliaments elections , that gathered female and male deputies of the current legislature and of the prior one , in equal numbers , and discussed this matter in terms of citizenship and democratic rights .  
The current initiative , however , had alleviated only a small part of the debt of a limited number of countries and she therefore welcomed the progress achieved at the recent annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF to achieve dramatic cuts in the debt burden of the heavily indebted developing countries , linking those cuts to poverty reduction strategies . 
In the context of the current global difficulties , it had become increasingly evident that economic , social and cultural rights must no longer be relegated to a secondary rank .  
In this connection , the Advisory Committee was informed that serious constraints have also been encountered in obtaining the dedicated services of requisite personnel from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations owing to the current rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping activities , as well as in retaining highly skilled technical IMIS staff and finding qualified personnel in the field of information technology under the current United Nations salary scales .  
The Advisory Committee notes the statement , in paragraph 4 of the note by the Secretary-General , that general temporary assistance , in addition to being used to replace staff on maternity or sick leave or to ensure adequate staffing during peak workload periods , is used to fund specific positions which are associated with some degree of uncertainty as to the need for them to be retained in the definite future , either at their current level or in their current pattern of grades and categories . 
An analysis of the adjustments in current account balances undertaken in its aftermath had suggested that they had been undertaken by the worst possible means not through a virtuous cycle of export expansion leading to market growth but through a vicious cycle of import repression , generating losses in export values because of the combined inflationary effects of demand contraction , excess supply and currency devaluations .  
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
UNISPACE III , which had taken place in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and the exhibition of space science and technology organized in parallel with that event , had given the participants an opportunity to evaluate the current state of international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space and to consider ways and means of further developing the respective programmes and strategies with which humankind would enter the twenty-first century .  
The Board is composed of five persons with relevant experience in the field of human rights and contemporary forms of slavery in particular , who serve in their personal capacity , as United Nations experts and are appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term , in consultation with the current Chairman of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , with due regard to equitable geographical distribution . 
With regard to accountability of United Nations military and civilian police observers for losses of or damage to United Nations property caused by them , the current common practice in field missions is to withhold two weeks of mission subsistence allowance entitlements prior to the departure of the military or police observers concerned , in respect of cases in which they are involved , pending the taking of a decision by the Headquarters Property Survey Board .  
The current environment , driven by free market forces and unpredictable capital fluctuations had been favourable to countries which benefited from sound economic conditions , technology and capital but unfavourable to the majority of developing countries which were relatively uncompetitive and marginalized .  
ProgWork.nsf ) is composed of two parts : the work in progress part , containing information on planned or current work in progress of the international organizations ; and the completed work part , which provides details and annotations on previously adopted statistical standards and published methodological work .  
It was further agreed that , to advance the work of the Council on the draft regulations , the Secretary-General would consult with the incoming President of the Council and with the regional groups and interest groups with a view to identifying the main areas of difficulty in the current draft and the most efficient working method which would enable the outstanding issues to be resolved .  
The Commission continues to believe that the existence of a national border in close proximity to the duty station makes Geneva a distinct situation which justifies the current post adjustment system , which was tailored to reflect that difference ; the legal , administrative , and technical difficulties associated with any of the above-described changes to the current arrangement militate strongly against implementation of those changes .  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
They will continue as usual to follow their economic , educational , political and social development plans and programmes , knowing that the end of the twentieth century will not automatically mean an end to current regional conflicts .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
This policy would open the economy to market forces while at the same time restoring the valuable contribution of social action ; it would be geared to a gradual reduction of the imbalances and inequities of our current reality and to the transformation of relations between the State and civil society ; it would promote greater participation of communities in development efforts at the local and regional levels .  
Unless the imposition of cultures and artificial borders by colonial Powers is recognized as an essential historical factor in many current conflicts and unless the right to independence and self-determination is accepted and the diversity of cultures and models comprehended , conflicts will continue .  
This imbues the Courts current report with a special character , since this objective for the Decade of International Law coincides with the supreme objective behind the establishment of the International Court of Justice in 1946 : that the Court should be an effective , efficient judicial means for the peaceful settlement of disputes .  
The symbolic and joyful concurrence of events should encourage all of us to make more active and effective efforts to ensure that current and future generations will enjoy a brighter future , free from the current problems challenging the international community .  
The IPU has taken up the cause of the large segment of humanity which is not a beneficiary of globalization and , at the recent conference in Berlin , discussed the need to revise the current global financial and economic model , and adopted a resolution which called for special initiatives for underdeveloped , debt-ridden countries .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .

My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
The draft resolution is also silent on the current impasse in the Conference on Disarmament due to the inflexibility shown by a few delegations on the questions of nuclear disarmament and outer space , ignoring the express wishes of the vast majority of its members , which support the commencement of substantive negotiations as part of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work .

The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .

The current meeting would be another milestone in the quest for sustainable development , which represented a basic precondition for peace and collective human security for global economic order .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
There exist in the current international political and economic order many unjust and unreasonable factors that are not conducive to the stability and development of the many developing countries .  
In the face of the major challenges posed by current humanitarian emergencies , it is our understanding that it is up to the Member States to adopt measures to provide political and logistic support so as to better meet the needs for assistance .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
That was demonstrated by the current social unrest in Benin ( varying from a merciless pursuit of armed gangs of looters to a widespread strike of civil servants ) , which was rooted in the economic problems linked to the countrys underdevelopment .

Innovative research , such as that which contributed such key concepts to current development thinking as sustainable human development ( SHD ) and global public goods will be strengthened ;  
In short , although globalization offers enormous potential for human development in the twentyfirst century , its current benefits are unevenly distributed while its costs are concentrated among the poorest and most vulnerable .  
As one member of the Commission had stated , paragraph 2 in its current form was too broad and left the door open for any junior official to formulate a unilateral act that would more than likely be invalidated subsequently .  
In the current context of globalization , economic , social and cultural rights have to be understood , more than ever , as an indivisible part of human rights and must be implemented as such .  
The current practice in financial regulation and supervision is for the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) to formulate standards expected to be applied by national authorities , rather than to establish a global regulatory agency .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
First , the peace process in the Congo has lately witnessed a number of consecutive steps that have served to maintain the current momentum aimed at implementing the Lusaka Agreement in both its military and political components and at reaching a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict , which has been tearing the Congo apart and draining the energies of its neighbours for almost three years . 
Finally , let me express our hope that the current open debate , focused on the Secretary-Generals report on conflict prevention , will foster the effective implementation of the recommendations contained therein and contribute to the goal of mobilizing the collective potential of the United Nations , its Member States and other international stakeholders in eliminating the threat of the emergence of armed conflicts .  
The Council can act with a view to monitoring and ensuring compliance with current Council resolutions ; improving communication and coordination with other United Nations organs and authoritative bodies involved in the protection of civilians , particularly children ; ensuring that the post-conflict environment nurtures the rights and needs of children , including rehabilitation , which is integral to future stability and development ; and ensuring that the it takes an integrated and interdisciplinary approach and gives due consideration to the rights of children when considering peacekeeping operations .  
That the current status also reflects some shortcomings and failures : recurring conflicts , interruptions in democratic processes , genocide and massacres , serious violations of human rights , the persistence of behaviours hindering the development of a democratic culture , the lack of independence in certain institutions , and economic , financial and social constraints , which cause citizens to lose faith in democracy ;

That is a severe disappointment , but it was a prudent decision based on the current and growing level of peacekeeping activity and the need for sufficient cash to cover the requirements for these ongoing missions .  
As far as we , the Palestinian people , are concerned , we believe that this failure also means a failure to contribute to ending the tragedy that has been taking place in the occupied Palestinian territories because of the bloody and oppressive campaign waged against our people by Israel the occupying Power and by the leaders in charge and the current and previous Israeli Prime Ministers Messrs . Sharon and Barak through all their declared and expressed statements and positions that run counter to international law and that call for escalation and confrontation .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
The Panels recommendations revolve around six broad themes : ( 1 ) sanctions against countries and individuals involved in the illegal activities ; ( 2 ) preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of the current situation ; ( 3 ) reparations to the victims of the illegal exploitation of natural resources ; ( 4 ) design of a framework for reconstruction ; ( 5 ) improvement of international mechanisms and regulations governing some natural resources ; and ( 6 ) security issues . 
The conclusion that can be drawn at the present stage is that , despite worldwide awareness of the dangers of a pattern of globalization which , in its current form , constantly widens the gap between rich and poor and contributes to the marginalization of increasing numbers of countries , particularly in Africa , there is still no clear determination in the international community to take decisive action and devote the necessary resources to attain the noble and ambitious goals established by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit .  
After consideration of the various views expressed , the Commission decided that the question of the desirability and feasibility of preparing a model law or model legislative provisions on selected issues covered by the Legislative Guide should be considered by the Commission at its current session . 
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
Notes with concern the continued problems related to the rule of law and the functioning of the judiciary , inter alia , of corruption , including interference by the executive with the independence of the judiciary , welcomes the Governments continued commitment to reform the judiciary , commends its current efforts to prepare the laws and codes that are essential components of the basic legal framework , and urges the Government to continue to take the necessary measures to promote the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy and the judicial system as a whole ;

Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
The associations rejected this measure , arguing that the National Association does not represent them and that the frequencies assigned belong to the State radio TGW , so that transferring their use to private individuals would use up the nationwide frequencies in State hands and render the current legislative process meaningless . 
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
Using available estimates , a minimum of $ 500-700-million of global funding , on which countries can draw swiftly in order to fill their budgetary gaps , must be generated , and an additional $ 500-800-million will be required to ensure continued accessibility by countries to essential interventions such as safe and efficacious combination drugs ( once current first-line treatments have outlived their usefulness ) or long-lasting insecticide-treated nets .  
This dire prognosis is based on the analysis of the current epidemiological situation in Georgia and neighbouring countries , all of which are experiencing widespread drug abuse , increased migration , and lack of disposable medical instruments and diagnostic test systems , among other factors .  Currently , Georgia is still within the so-called window of opportunity for preventing the massive spread of HIV / AIDS .  
A salient feature of that programme was organizing periodic seminars / symposia to focus attention on specific issues falling within the framework of disarmament and development in the context of current international relations , as well as providing a forum where relevant United Nations bodies , non-governmental organizations and other international agencies could share their experience in areas of common or overlapping concerns .  
It can not but be recognized that small arms are , paradoxically , those that claim the most victims , both civilian and military , given the nature of the current conflicts afflicting many countries , small arms and light weapons , apart from their undeniable advantage in terms of cost , proving to be the most adapted to the terrain and to the actions engaged in : easily transportable , they can be rapidly distributed and concealed . 
The Group was convinced that , in the current situation of limited financial resources , UNIDO should continue to enhance its potential for technical cooperation in environment-related activities by strengthening existing working relationships with other international organizations such as GEF and the Montreal Protocol .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 248 of 23 December 1999 , decided that , in the absence of an Assembly decision to the contrary , the use of remote interpretation should not constitute an alternative to the current institutionalized system of interpretation , and that the use of remote interpretation should not affect the quality of interpretation or in itself lead to any further reductions in language posts , nor should it affect the equal treatment of the six official languages .  
During the current biennium , the Office of the Special Coordinator has also intensified its support to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , with a view to increasing the chances of small island developing States to find new economic opportunities in the global economy and avoid their further marginalization .  18 .  The Office of the Special Coordinator continued to provide analytical work on the economic vulnerability of small island developing States .  
In the current stage of global development , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution for each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations .  
Welcomes the current participation in the capacity of observers of those Non-Self-Governing Territories that are associate members of the regional commissions in United Nations world conferences in the economic and social sphere , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions , including resolutions and decisions of the Assembly and the Special Committee on specific Territories , and in the special sessions of the Assembly ;  
UNFPA agreed to organize the eighth Round Table on Communication for Development , scheduled to take place from 26 to 29 November 2001 in Managua , Nicaragua , and proposed the following three central issues : evaluating the information programmes designed to halt the HIV / AIDS pandemic ; development of methodologies to evaluate current communication programmes ; and using community radio to reach the disadvantaged .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The detailed and extensive analysis comprised aspects relating to the evolution of mercenaries over time , the means employed by mercenaries , the most visible cases of such activities , the problems raised by the current definition of mercenary under international law and ways of strengthening the United Nations in pursuing its aim to put an end to mercenary activities throughout the world .  
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
Based on experience to date , the current funding level of the operational reserve , targeted at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year , appears sufficient to meet the requirements originally included in the definition of the operational reserve .  
The Council concluded its high-level segment with the adoption of a Ministerial Declaration which expressed grave concern that if current economic trends continued , the majority of African countries would be unable to achieve international development goals .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires , inter alia , a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of ODA ) , to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
Human solidarity and social justice will ultimately win out over the egoistic , unjust conceptions that serve as pillars of the existing international economic order , aggravated by the neoliberal precepts imposed on the current globalization process . 
Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
The Government of the Republic of Cuba is confident that human solidarity and social justice will prevail over the selfish and unjust concepts underpinning the current international economic order , which are aggravated by the neo-liberal theories imposed by the current process of globalization .  
These included : the worsening of the food security problem ; the structural difficulty of achieving competitiveness within the current international agricultural markets ; and the strong dependency on exports from this sector for the acquisition of hard currency .  
The current political process might seem slow , but the sensitive nature of the issues involved and the far-reaching implications for the countrys future made it vitally important that the National Convention proceed slowly and systematically in order to safeguard the interests of all the national races and to avoid replicating the shortcomings of the two previous Constitutions .  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions should strengthen their support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop borders post , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
The main goal of the interim programme is to break the inflationary spiral and put a stop to the current distortions in the economy , through a tight budgetary policy and a monetary policy compatible with the chosen goals . 
Thus the weighted average of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita ( estimated at current official exchange rates ) is estimated to be $ 0.65 per day for the total population in African LDCs and $ 0.88 per day in Asian LDCs in the late 1990s , whilst in PPP terms ( in 1985 international prices ) it is estimated to be $ 1.51 per day in African LDCs and $ 4.59 per day in Asian LDCs .  
Once the revised budgets for missions in transition ( UNMEE , UNAMSIL , MONUC and UNIFIL ) and for the support account for peacekeeping operations , with the proposed resource requirements resulting from the comprehensive review and capacity study , have been considered by the General Assembly , budget levels are projected to increase over the initial current level of $ 1.7-billion to some slightly in excess of $ 3.0-billion for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 .  
In our view , the Conference on Disarmament is a precious resource because , even in its current situation , it offers more space than any other forum for official multilateral dialogue on issues of concern .  Yet , questions are raised - for example , is the Conference on Disarmament a creature of the international security environment that awakes from its enforced hibernation only when there is adequate change in that environment ?  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions , should strengthen its support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop border posts , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .

It is true that this method has played a positive role in ensuringassuring the all aspects of military in every construction , but this method has such problems , such as being too general in contents , not being transparent and being too weak to bein binding .  
Yang pointed out : With the deepening of the reform , the expansion of the opening up , and the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure , China 's administrative and management structures have been reformed accordingly and marked results have been scored .  However , the problem of the current administrative and management structures being unable to completely meet the demands of the socialist market economy still exists .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
He said that under the current international situation of multipolarization and economic globalization , the developing countries should intensify unity and coordination , cope with all problems in a positive attitude , and make concerted efforts to establish a fair , reasonable new international political and economic order .  
At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .  To retort , Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai pointed out in all seriousness that the United States was keen to dish out human rights motions against other countries , wantonly attacked other countries ' political systems by flaunting the banner of " safeguarding human rights , " tried hard to turn human rights issues into political issues for achieving its political purpose of exerting pressure onto other countries .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
It must be pointed out that the Dalai 's current visit to Taiwan is another adverse current designed to split the motherland since the Taiwan authorities gave the green light in mid-March to an overseas " Taiwan independence " organization - - the " World Taiwan Society , " which staged a farce in Taiwan of openly clamoring for " building the country through Taiwan independence . "  
The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
The conference demanded that the whole party and all levels throughout the country make common efforts and devote great energy to resolve the current conspicuous problems in public order , resolutely achieve the objective of bringing about a marked turn for the better in public order within two years , properly ensure that the masses can live and work in peace and contentment , properly preserve the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and provide an effective guarantee for socialist reforms and opening up and modernization .  
Zhang Wannian 's current visit is carrying on the past traditions and opening a way for the future , which is aimed at increasing mutual understanding and trust , promoting friendly cooperation , and impelling the steady and healthy development of relations between the two countries and armies .  
In the current struggle , we must create an awe-inspiring situation , fully mobilize the masses , strengthen mass prevention and mass treatment , and spread a far-lung network with which to prevent and crack down on crime so that criminal elements whose cases are serious will be held in awe and hit hard , and those who committed petty crimes will repent and make a fresh start and begin their lives anew .  
The editorial says : The current incident of bumping aircraft was caused by the US side single-handedly based on human testimony and material evidence .  However , the US side made unfounded countercharges after the incident , unreasonably criticized the Chinese side , and even used international law to evade its responsibility .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
According to the spirit of the central economic work conference and the Fourth Session of the Ninth National People 's Congress , the meeting analyzed the current situation , unified people 's thinking , and set forth the main tasks and key points for this year 's work .  
The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Li Lanqing said : One of the main purposes of my current visit to France is , while pushing forward political and economic cooperation between China and France , to boost development of cultural exchange and cooperation between the two countries - - this is extremely important and indispensable to promoting the comprehensive partnership between our two countries .

Some MAC members maintained that the status quo between Washington , Beijing , and Taipei would not go on forever .  They said that Taiwan must come up with short - , medium - and long-term Mainland policies and objectives to deal with the " intermediate agreement " that the US side once mentioned , and the " one country , two systems " formula the Mainland authorities persistently follows.Some other MAC members pointed out that the government has been acting rather passively in approaching current international affairs .

Wen Jiabao inquired about the living conditions of the local people in details and took part in a discussion meeting with local cadres and masses on current rural work .  
The current forum - - " Next Generation Asia " - - devoted to discussions on such issues as corporate management , competition advantages , information infrastructure construction , and electronic commerce , will be conducive to improving the management level of enterprises in Asia , promoting the development of the Asia economy , and benefiting all the parties concerned in seeking business opportunities .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
She hoped that all relevant ministries and state commissions make further effort , guarantee the smooth operation of the existing work mechanisms , and further strengthen cooperation among the customs , financial , monetary , taxation , and quality inspection departments , continue to implement the current supportive and encouraging policies and measures , and ensure the smooth development of the work of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
The Chinese side expounded the principled stand on the current bilateral relations and on the Taiwan issue , and stressed : China is willing to develop healthy and stable relations with the United States ; the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations should be abided by .  
This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .  
During his " journey to establish communication , " Mr . Siew explained on many occasions that he favors adopting the model of European economic union under the current conditions of political deadlock across the Taiwan Strait to implement the concept of economic cooperation by shelving disputes and proceeding in an orderly and gradual manner and in stages in accordance with the " common market " formula .  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
Encouraged by the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to China and out of the worry about and righteous indignation at the " Taiwan independence " splittist forces ' attempt to split the country , Chinese nationals residing abroad and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have taken active actions and conscientiously plunged themselves into the powerful current of opposing " Taiwan independence " and division and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland , thus forming a grand-scale upsurge of patriotism .  
However , at least before the election to be held by the end of this year , the current relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong suffers from no immediate and obvious conflict of political interests nor any unfavorable subjective and objective factors to their interactions .  Even if Lee Teng-hui vigorously reveals that the main character of the scandal of Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corporation is in fact Lien Chan , it still can not undermine the present relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong .  
Professor Yin Naiping of Taiwan National Chengchi University held : Taiwan could not control some of the factors that contributed to its current economic , financial , and banking difficulties , for example , international economic recession and burdens left behind from the past .  However , we could not deny that due to their incompetent administration , Taiwan authorities have created additional problems , inappropriately handled problems left behind from the past , and further aggravated Taiwan 's economy .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
The factors that have enabled triad-related and evil forces to survive and expand over a long period of time in the past have also proved a key issue for the concentrated study and analysis of procuratorial organs at all levels in their current case-handling work of examining and rectifying arrests and instituting legal proceedings .  The Supreme People 's Court has stressed that cases involving the " protective umbrellas " of triad-related and evil forces which are reported to the authorities by the masses shall be resolutely investigated and dealt with as key cases .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
At this critical moment for carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future , the party Central Committee and the State Council are holding a relevant meeting to summarize past experience and arrange the work for the next 10 years .

Some current provincial governors and ministers ( excluding those in special departments ) between the ages of 62 and 65 years ( the age for retirement at this level ) will be retired ahead of time by the end of this year so that their younger successors may be elected into the party central committee next year at the 16th party congress .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .  
Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .  
During the visit , NPC Chairman Li Peng exchanged views with leaders of the national assemblies , governments , and political parties in the three countries on strengthening bilateral relations in the new century and on the current international and regional situations .

In an editorial on 7 June , the China Times pointed out structural factors behind the island 's current economic malaise .  If the root cause of the problems is not dealt with and if overhasty actions are adopted , the paper stated , economic problems would only be made even more complicated and intractable .  
Li Lanqing stressed : In rectifying and regulating the market economic order , we must proceed our tasks in a quick , responsible , and extensive manner , and adopt strong policies .  Party committees and governments at all levels must firmly uphold the principle of tackling current and long-term tasks , realistically strengthen leadership in this work , divide the work , cooperate closely , and work with concerted efforts to achieve a decisive victory .  
Moore , director-general of WTO , also attended the meeting and gave a briefing on the progress of relevant preparatory work currently carried out in Geneva . One of the important objectives and results of the current meeting was that all parties concerned expressed a firm determination to ensure that a new round of talks will start this year .  
P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .  Without long-ranch fighters and forward bases , the United States has very limited capability to counter the PLA 's attack on Taiwan . In a modern war that emphasizes quick decision , US rescue to Taiwan would be too slow to meet the urgent need when the PLA launches an attack on Taiwan .  
This important directive fully demonstrates that firmly establishing the viewpoint of the masses , adhering to the line of the masses and solving practical problems faced by the masses are crucial to strengthening and improving party-building .  This directive explicitly points out the direction for our current educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
It is for this reason that Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , respectively the core of the first three generations of the leadership group of the Party Central Committee , published at crucial moments in the revolution and construction important speeches on " the current situation and the task , " comprehensively and correctly analyzed the domestic and international situation at that time and educated the Party , the military and the people .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
Although China still has not entered the WTO , considering the special situation in China , in December of last year WTO headquarters sent out China 's only set of complete written materials , CD-ROMs and indexing tools to establish the Center .

At the time the Center was established , more than 30 newspapers nationwide carried a report on it , including Xinhua , Zhongxin , the People 's Daily , and the Beijing Qingnianbao .

In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
According to Cheng Yun-peng , director of the publicity department of the DPP , who accompanied him to visit Lee , the atmosphere of the talks was relaxed and harmonious .  They talked about the political and economic situation in Taiwan .

During the current visit , he revealed , he has contacted quite a few French entrepreneurs and exchanged views with them on bilateral cooperation , adding that he is satisfied with what has been done in general .  However , he said , judging from their economic strengths , cooperative potential between the two countries has not been fully exploited .

"

It is essential to have a profound understanding of the long-term , arduous and complex nature of the work against corruption .  Not only is it necessary to be prepared for protracted battles , but also intensify our efforts to address current issues .  
All comrades in the party should set up a lofty communist ideal , fortify their conviction and spur themselves on by holding to lofty ideological and moral standards .  More importantly , they should make unremitting efforts in a down-to-earth manner to realize the party 's basic program for the current stage and put their heart into each single piece of work now .  
Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .  The possibility of buying or selling organs is close to zero .  It is even less likely that people will be able to buy organs for 200-500 yuan as the media reported .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
Cao Gangchuan stressed that implementing the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech requires fully undertaking the armament mission and duty , while linking this closely with steadfast implementation of policies of the Party 's route , while linking this closely with implementation of the Party 's basic guiding principles in the current phase , while linking this closely with the fundamental achievement of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization by the middle of this century , and making the demands of the " three represents " a part of our armed combat preparations .

Zanoun said : China 's righteous stance on international and regional affairs has been highly appreciated by the Arab states , including the Palestinian people .  China is the most reliable friend of the Arab people .  Palestine expects China to play an even greater role in halting the current bloody conflicts between Israel and Palestine and in bringing about an all-round , fair , and reasonable solution to the Middle East issue soon .  
Clinton handed over to Bush the quite good relationship with China which prevailed during the latter part of his presidency , but when Bush took office the majority of those he employed were Republican conservatives and cold warriors , and moreover they had been absent from the political arena for many years and their understanding of current world issues was markedly backward .  As a result US relations with many countries have become deadlocked in less than half a year after Bush took office .  
A sweeping view of the current world shows that the tide of economic globalization is fast and violent , that science and technology progress with each passing day , that competition in overall national strength is increasingly keen , and that various ideologies are crisscrossing and surging against one another .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
Despite the fact that the current situation at home and abroad is favorable to us , we must soberly realize that China is developing its modernization program in a more complicated international environment .  Right now , the world is undergoing profound changes .  It is becoming more and more multi-polarized , and continuously marching toward economic globalization .  
However , some of the outstanding problems in the Party , especially problems among leading cadres with regard to Party spirit and conduct , were not solved .  A considerable number of leading cadres still fail to meet or completely meet the requirements in carrying out their tasks and keep pace with the current situation in the ideological and political realm .  
According to military sources , Chen zhen-xiang , taking a handful of Army General Headquarters officers with him , left for a secret visit to Europe on 30 June . At least Germany , Austria and Switzerland were included in his itinerary .  It is believed that he visited some of the host countries ' army units to get acquainted with the current situation of their army-building efforts and learn from their experience in the use of wheel-type armored vehicles and tactical wheel-type vehicles .  
Ferreting out the " protective umbrella " of underworld and evil forces should be perceived as a major content of the current drive of investigating and handling on-the-job crimes , as an emphasis of the work in deeply promoting the anti-corruption campaign , and as an important content of the work in examining and approving the arrests of criminals and in examining lawsuits .  No matter what unit and what persons are involved , all cases must be investigated thoroughly regardless of obstructions so that the evil forces can be rooted out .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
Diplomats of the two countries disclosed that Jiang Zemin and Putin will hold a summit meeting to exchange their views on the current international situation , major global and regional issues , including the US claim to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and its readiness to build the national missile defense system .  The two heads of state will reiterate their stands clarified during the " Shanghai Five " summit in June this year , namely , Putin stressed that Russia firmly safeguarded the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to prevent a new round of arms race ;  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
He then pointed out that the potential for expansion of economic relations between Belarus and China is far from being fully developed .  Measures must continue to be taken , and a new scope of cooperation and new projects must be identified .  The current pattern of pure trade must transform into more modern , more advanced methods of cooperation , such as joint research , development , and production of high-tech products .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
After Comrade Jiang Zemin examined the current domestic and foreign situations and the mission of our Party , and after he analyzed how to persist in keeping the Party 's nature one as the vanguard of the working class in the new historical conditions so as to safeguard our Party 's advanced nature , he put forward this extremely profound explanation , making clear the orientation of Party construction in the new period .  
China and Russia will further strengthen strategic cooperation , together advance the world multipolarization process and the building of a democratic , fair , and rational new economic order , and work together to preserve world peace and promote joint development , This is the objective requirement of the current development of the international situation and is also the unshirkable major responsibility of the two countries .  
The two leaders exchanged views in a cordial , friendly , and businesslike atmosphere on the current state and prospects of their bilateral relations and on international issues of common concern , and reached broad consensus . 
To cope with the situation as quickly as possible , the government should increase high-technology weapons , get rid of the thinking of symmetrical operations , change the current situation in which the army amounts to a higher proportion in the three armed forces , and implement as quickly as possible the tactic of downsized troops .  In this way , the situation in which outlays for personnel maintenance accounts for half the annual defense budget and eats up the military investment budget can be avoided and fighting capability will be intensified .  
In fact , they are " deadlocks to be resolved . "  While intensifying efforts to publicize the issues of reducing and eliminating poor countries ' debts , the current G-8 summit was unable to implement any new and concrete measures to further reduce and eliminate poor countries ' heavy foreign debts even though $ 53-billion of foreign debts have been accumulatively reduced or exempted from 23 poorest countries in the world .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .

With regard to the current issues in China 's management structure , there are three points that merit special attention : First , the contractual relationship between the principal and the agent is not sufficiently distinct , so that the agent does not understand what his functions are in the course of concrete operations , which are chiefly manifested in the failure to resolve such fundamental problems as the indistinct functions between the government and the enterprises and between the party and the enterprises .  
In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .

In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .  
But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .

Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .

Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .

Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
A military source said that the situation of current cross-strait ties is changeable and the period is crucial .  There is no need to be panic because it is quite normal and reasonable for the troops stationed along the coast to be on alert and to be prepared for all contingencies .  
It is rather ignorant of history and the current situation and quite arrogant for Chen Shui-bian to sell the old stuff in 2000 .  This is of no help for easing up the tense situation across the strait .  The Chinese people have waged a struggle against the US theory asserting that " Taiwan 's status is not yet settled " for more than four decades and the US ultimately recognized that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and there is only one China in the world ;  
With SOEs facing so many problems , the current problems that affect the overall order have a far-reaching impact , and must be solved are the strategic adjustment of our state-owned economy and the corporate-upgrading reform of SOEs These are two basic problems for intensifying SOE reform and fully stimulating the growth potential of our national economy .

It is necessary to take advantage of the opportune moment of the WTO entry to leave no stone unturned to expand exports and heighten the level of using foreign capital , maintain the current momentum of growth in foreign trade , and exercise the role of export demand in promoting economic growth .  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of purchasing peasants ' surplus grain without restriction , the State Council decided to increase the scale of grain risk funds by 8 billion yuan this year , which is to be shared by the central and local financial authorities according to the current proportion they are responsible for ;  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin praised highly the visit of General Secretary Kim Jong-Il at the important historical moment of the turn of the century .  He maintained that the current visit is of important significance to further improvement of mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and two countries , and to the promotion of development of Sino-DPRK friendly relations [ zhong chao you hao guan xi ] oriented toward the new century .  
However , Annette Lu , a person who holds a master 's degree in law , has disregarded the historical facts and legal documents at the current moment when cross-strait relations are facing a severe test .  She has confounded right with wrong , and replayed in an unscrupulous manner the " old tune " of " Taiwan independence . "  
Our current uncoordinated grain production and marketing structure is a very glaring problem , with a shortage of quality varieties , a surplus of popular and dependable varieties , a lack of adaptation to market demand , and the inability to sell at good prices being the key reasons for the grain selling difficulties and for peasants producing more but earning less .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .  In addition , the CPC 's current attitude is that if Taiwan does not return to the " one-China " principle , nothing can be discussed .  Therefore now is not the time to raise the aforesaid issue .  
Under the current social conditions where China is carrying out reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , the broad masses of academicians and scientists of the older generation should pay special attention to teaching , helping , and guiding the younger generation ideologies , work style , and academic attitudes .  They should teach them to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and to consolidate their determination to devote their lives to scientific undertakings and their confidence to attain new accomplishments .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
The work of moving enterprises from the dam area must be closely combined with economic and enterprise restructuring ; enterprises which produce backward products , which have obsolete plant , which pollute the environment , which wreck resources , and whose assets can not cover their debts must be closed down or declared bankrupt according to the procedure , as appropriate ; they absolutely can not be resettled in their current state .  
Meeting participants , using Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking " Three Represents " as guidance and targeting current prominent issues in public order , studied and put forward suggestions to improve comprehensive management of the social order .  
To make the work of arming the whole party with Marxist theory more successful , we must vigorously promote the study style of integrating theory with practice , adhere to the Marxist scientific spirit and tenets , persist in emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , and work hard to arrive at scientific , persuasive , and realistic interpretations and explanations on prominent current issues that require theoretical guidance and explanation , so as to make full use of the fundamental role of theory in ideological-political work .  
The questions of how we should approach the current international and domestic situations , how we should approach the various problems cropping up in China 's reform and opening up especially in the course of building a socialist market economy , and how we should face the difficulties and challenges facing our economic and social lives all have to do with the political conviction of party-member cadres and all the more with the confidence and morale of the broad masses of the people .  It will not do not to face and not to look at them squarely .  
The successful practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the liveliest and most convincing teaching material , and the various advanced individuals who emerged from among us and their advanced and typical deeds are the liveliest and most current and brilliant teaching materials .  We must carry out education in ideals and conviction with perfect assurance and push ahead socialist civilization building unwaveringly .  
The circular urged that all units should treat the process of studying and carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a process of strengthening and improving the army 's ideological and political work .  Guided by the speech , they should further deepen the guiding spirit of the political work for the whole army .  We must make efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological-political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .

In view of this and in consideration of the current regional and surrounding geopolitical circumstances , all sides have determined to deepen cooperation in the political , diplomatic , economic and trade , military , military technological , and other fields to consolidate regional peace and stability .  
According to relevant stipulations , if the two interested parties apply , investigation organs must give an opportunity for both sides to express their opinions face to face .

The results of the auditing show that in general the tasks in executing the 1999 central budget and managing and utilizing the state bonds special funds have been carried out well .

The government and the opposition parties are engaged in wave after wave of defensive and offensive battles centering on the issues , such as mainland policy , economic policy , and coalition cabinet .  Moreover , there are divergent voices within the ruling authorities and the DPP and the stock market has been sluggish for a long time .  These situations have to do with the current chaotic and uncertain cross-strait situation .  
By continuing to maintain and push forward the current favorable situation in economic growth , our country will be able to further effect sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
To maintain the good momentum in economic development in the current situation , we should step up our efforts to implement the proactive fiscal policy and do all we can to better achieve the planned targets for this year so that a solid foundation will be laid for economic development and social stability .  
However , Putin 's China visit itself and his recent series of speeches on the policy toward China have clearly proven that the current Russian Government has not diminished its attention to Asia , and that it has fully affirmed and highly valued the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation , regarded China as Russia 's most important cooperative partner , and considered Sino-Russian relations the area Russia should develop on a priority basis in implementing its foreign policy .  
In the face of this gratifying situation , the official responsible for the State Metallurgy Industrial Bureau reminded that the current economic recovery and favorable turn in efficiency is initial , restorative , and limited .

We therefore propose to amend the Ordinance to the effect that any initial , annual and balancing allowances granted , and balancing charges made , when the building was used previously as either an industrial or commercial building , will be aggregated with the allowances granted under its current use ( industrial or commercial as appropriate ) to derive the net overall position when calculating the balancing charges or allowances at the time of the building 's disposal .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the second quarter of 2000 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit and a continued net outflow of current transfers , yet more than offset by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus and a substantial growth in net inflow of external factor income .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2000 with the first quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit was little changed at $ 19.3 billion , while the invisible trade surplus went up from $ 23.8 billion to $ 28.2 billion .

Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by an increase in invisible trade surplus .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2000 with the third quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 10.5 billion to $ 14.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 32.8 billion to $ 38.9 billion .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .

Not only does it meet the policy to allocate the licences in a fair and efficient manner , but also achieve the aim of encouraging entry into the 3G market under the current conditions of the telecommunications market .

In view of the economic situation , the Housing Authority has not adjusted its public housing rents since 1998 .  The rents for many flats are still at 1995 levels .  Arising from other factors such as the sale and redevelopment of housing estates and the allocation of larger flats , the current median rent-to-income ratio is above 10% .  However , to the extent that this phenomenon has arisen not as a direct consequence of rental adjustments , the Housing Authority has not broken the law .  
The need and reasonableness of an across-the-board cut is doubtful .  The Housing Authority 's current measure to re-assess the rent for individual commercial tenant according to commercial principles can better reflect the reality and help needy tenants maintain their competitiveness .  Rental reductions will not benefit shop tenants which have been enjoying prosperous business .  If so , this would be a waste of public funds .  
" Even though the tenancy between the single operators and the licensees is a commercial matter between the two , the Housing Authority has , in the light of the experience in the 1998 rent re-assessment , considered that it could take a more proactive approach to ensure that the rent reductions granted to the single operators after the rent re-assessment would be passed on to the licensees in full .  This would help the licensees through the current economic hard times , " Ms Chung said in her letter .

( c ) The current lighting requirement for swimming pools for recreational use were drawn up having regard to guidelines recommended by an international professional body , i.e . , average illumination of not less than 200 lux measured horizontally at the pool water surface .  
We are weary that the above measures will be interpreted by some as being interventionist .  However , given the current exceptional dire state of the property market , we believe there is an impending need for Government to bring forward extraordinary measures in the coming year .  Our aim is to restore public confidence in the property market as speedily and effectively as possible .  
With ocean cargo flows to the United States returning to normal by now , and even allowing for some downside in the export performance for the remaining two months of the year , the forecast growth rate in real terms of total exports of goods in 2002 is still lifted , to 7.1% in the current update , from 5.4% as put out earlier .  
This would not only increase the Government 's fiscal burden in the future by incurring substantial additional expenditure , but also fail to address the current structural problem of insufficient recurrent revenue to cover recurrent expenditure .  
Will the Government inform this Council whether , up to the present , there are any groups or organizations which have applied to the Government for land by private treaty grant but have not yet been informed of the outcomes ; if so , the number and names of these groups or organizations , the size and premium per square foot at the current market value of the land concerned , and the relevant land lease term proposed by them ?  
Under current policy , the normal term of newly granted land leases for educational , religious and institutional / community facilities is 50 years .  For recreational / sports facilities and private independent schools , the normal terms of new land leases are 21 years and 10 years respectively .  
As in the housing policy statement I made on 13 November 2002 , we will undertake a thorough review of the Ordinance with a view to resuming the free operation of the private rental market , giving owners the flexibility and autonomy they deserve , and mitigating the difficulties in recovering flats for re-letting in the light of the current ample supply and falling rentals .  Our objective is to relax excessive control in the rental market .  
The current deficit is serious and is threatening to undermine our financial strength and market confidence .  If the problem is not solved as soon as possible , Hong Kong risks being exposed to heightened speculation , which may trigger outflows of capital , rising interest rates , turmoil in the financial markets leading ultimately to possible attacks on our linked exchange rate system .  
( c ) of the average amount of public fund granted to each of these non-local students , together with the total amount of such funding , in the current academic year ; whether it knows which countries provide similar level of subsidies from public funds to foreign tertiary students ; and  
The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them . "  
The current fare adjustment mechanism has been established since December 2000 after consultation with the Legislative Council . We adopt the " Modified Basket of Factors Approach " to handle fare adjustment applications and the factors for consideration include changes in operating costs and revenue of the relevant bus company since its last fare adjustment , forecasts of its future costs , revenue and return , the need to provide the operator with a reasonable rate of return , public acceptability and affordability , and the quality and quantity of service provided .  
As the number of families and individuals requiring financial support by the Government is bound to increase given the current economic situation and high unemployment , the adjustment will enable us to ensure that the safety net can be maintained within our means and that existing resources go further to meet the increasing demand . 
We will introduce legislative amendments in the middle of this year to require installation of particulate traps and catalytic converters on all pre-Euro light diesel vehicles .  The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
* a DPS Fund - with a target fund size of 0.3% of the banking sector 's total amount of protected deposits , which is equivalent to approximately HK $ 1.6 billion at the current level of deposits - would be built up in approximately five years  
In response to announcement by Fitch Ratings to change Hong Kong 's outlook from stable to negative due to the impact of atypical pneumonia , a government spokesman stressed today ( April 24 ) the Government would spare no efforts and resources in controlling the disease .  The Government had also introduced a package of relief measures to help the community tide over the current economic difficulties and to revive our economy once the disease is under control .  
( a ) of the total area of pavement surfaces paved with precast paving slabs over the past two years and the amount of public expenditure involved , as well as the corresponding figures anticipated for the current and the coming year ;  
Since 1998 , the size of the retained mortgage portfolio has grown at an annual compound rate of 25.6% to the current amount of HK $ 28.3 billion , which is close to 5% of the residential mortgage loan market , " said Mr . Antony Leung , Chairman of the Board of Directors of the HKMC in the report .  
He urged corporations in both the public and private sectors to actively consider issuing bonds as a means for raising capital in light of the current market environment of record low bank deposit rates and uncertain equity market .  
While the differential treatment for child allowance between the first two children and the third to ninth child is unlikely to have a significant impact on the decision of a couple regarding the size of their family , the differential may not be appropriate in the light of our very low fertility rate and has been removed as from the current financial year . 
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
( b ) exclusive of New Territories small house applications , of the respective numbers of applications for change of land use made by private developers in the two ways mentioned above , in each of the past five years , the duration of the case which involved the longest vetting time , and the vetting time for the applications which got the earliest approval ; the current number of outstanding applications , as well as the estimated number of applications that may be approved ; and  
Comparing the first quarter of 2003 with the fourth quarter of 2002 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit increased from $ 5.6 billion to $ 16.0 billion , while the invisible trade surplus decreased from $ 52.1 billion to $ 40.1 billion .  
At a response rate of 72% , a total of 8 000 households were successfully enumerated for their views on a wide range of issues of concern to persons in the labour force , including challenges / problems encountered in the current jobs , perceived prospects of the currently engaged economic sectors and occupation categories , impact brought about by corporate restructuring since 2001 , personal career aspirations , experience in and aspirations for working in the Mainland , and experience in and plan for attending job-related training / retraining courses .  
* The figures derived from the survey relate only to RMLs provided by authorized institutions on the basis of first mortgages and which the reporting institution knows to be in negative equity ( i.e . the outstanding loan amount with the reporting institution exceeds the current market value of the mortgaged property ) .  Not included in these figures are some 58,400 RMLs associated with government-funded co-financing schemes and another 23,200 RMLs associated with private sector co-financing schemes .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2003 with the first quarter of 2003 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit decreased from $ 16.0 billion to $ 9.8 billion , as exports of goods remained robust , while import for local use was cut back distinctly amidst the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) .  
This was largely due to a markedly reduced current account surplus , as the spread of SARS in the second quarter resulted in a distinct setback in inbound tourism and related service exports , and hence a shrinkage in invisible trade surplus , and as net external factor income inflow also contracted considerably .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Although a large number of surplus teachers and fresh graduates of the Hong Kong Institute of Education ( HKIEd ) have indicated that it is difficult to secure a teaching post , I have received complaints that some schools have employed untrained university graduates as " permitted teachers " in the current school year .  
The main challenges in central banking are to maintain a monetary and banking environment that is optimal for stable and sustainable economic growth , and , particularly in the case of present-day Hong Kong , an environment that is conducive to resolving our current problems .

The Wide Field of Plastics With active assistance of the government and continued efforts of businessmen , the plastics industry in Taiwan , though starting late , has developed very rapidly . Beginning with processing imported raw materials into daily necessities , then expanding to the current export of self-produced raw materials , its development has been beyond expectation . Plastics have become an important key to the economic development of the Republic of China .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
As a result , I discovered , as we rehearsed , that they had made a lot of progress . " The combined performances of the 10 dancers who took part in the 1982 Arts Festival provided a rare opportunity to observe the current level of Chinese dance , and how naturally traditional culture and modern dance training have been combined in a free environment to create a base for its development .  
In selecting the subject matter for each series , the group tries to adhere to some specific guidelines . There are four main areas which serve as sources of stamp subjects . The first of these are themes drawn from the rich cultural heritage of Chinese tradition . Other selections are made in accordance with certain international activities such as the " International Year of the Child " , and still another criteria for selection are important current events .  
Apart from foreign debts , many communist ideologues find other reasons to oppose the current liberal policies . Some deplore the presence of " spiritual pollution " , seeing a growing materialism among mainland Chinese . Others view foreign investment as pure and simple exploitation of cheap labor , with the special treatment afforded to foreign firms and their workers inimical to the spirit of equality that communism was supposed to bring .  
The Blues and the Whites are two teams of popular singers , different each week , including current stars , experienced old hands , and hopeful newcomers , who compete in singing a gamut of songs in Mandarin , Taiwanese , and English : from romantic ballads , folk tunes , and art songs to pop and disco . . . . The variety of songs and singers appeals to young and old alike .  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
So starting from the present , the party should expand the channels for participation and communication , so that party members and cadres have ample opportunity to express their opinions . A view of the current political situation reveals ever-changing and treacherous trends and widespread military conflict . The antagonism between the two extremes of freedom and slavery as well as of democracy and totalitarianism has never let up in the least .  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
It does the last because it allows ROC citizens to practically comprehend the mainland , and allows the country 's future to be decided by open discussion ; in this way there slowly takes shape a consensus . Given Taiwan 's objective and subjective conditions , there is no way to accept either reunification under Chinese communist rule or absolute independence . It is necessary to undertake , under the current structure , maximum democratization internally and moderate , cautious exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , to achieve the objective of peaceful evolution .  
A : I only focus on how to do the job that I am doing at the current time . I have never considered the problem of future office . Because I personally believe that the Kuomintang has many talented people , the Kuomintang should select someone of accomplishment and moral fortitude to serve as the president 's main assistant .  
ConclusionThe four major programs and eleven key areas reported on above are the most salient of the government 's current administrative plans , aimed in essence at outlining a blueprint for future national development , and I hope you will be unsparing in your criticism and suggestions with regard to any points that may be inappropriate .  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
After current publisher Shaw Yu-ming assumed office , in 1987 Sinorama 's global vision was broadened and coverage of Chinese cultural traditions was strengthened . Series of reports on world sinology and sinologists , on famous universities , and other subjects appeared , and have already been collected and published in book form .  
Another prominent young Chinese of the upper echelons is Jose Chen Barria , previous head of the Bureau of Immigration , and current deputy chief auditor , who is considered something of a rising star .  
" When the current eight secondgeneration warships are completed , we will have the capability for independently designed and produced large-scale warships , which in the future can be sold abroad , " explains a high ranking officer from the naval construction development center , indicating confidence in the project scheduling .  
Basically speaking , we use a collage or cut-and-paste postmodern method , using the technique to strengthen a consumer 's impression of a commercial , " explains Hsu Shun-ying , who is creative director at the Yi Shi Hsing Tai Agency , which is responsible for Stimoral 's ads . The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
" We have to fight as few battles that we 're not sure of winning as possible to avoid wasting limited resources on meaningless frays , " says Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien , who states that our current foreign policy is oriented mainly toward regional , economic and functional areas .  
One unmarried social worker is worried that if she marries , it will affect her current employment . Another is worried about the problem of educating her children in the future , and keeps putting off getting married . Yet another , a single woman who owns an interior design business , quite frankly sticks to a philosophy of remaining single as a way to reduce the responsibilities of housework , " states the Cheng-Liao study .  
More than half the members of the current Diet are Waseda alumni , and the school has turned out four prime ministers , including Noboru Takeshita and Toshiki Kaifu . The Waseda " old school tie " network helps its own and wields tremendous clout . Besides featuring new academic concepts , the research center combines the latest art and technology in its architecture - - spacious , attractive buildings nestled in the hills . The big lecture halls , which can seat hundreds , are equipped with five or six television screens hooked up to the podium .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
You can find an oceanic current running by the islet on the east and west sides , the Kuroshio , which is a warm current from the equator . This comfortable and clear sea water has spawned a rich and beautiful foundation of ocean resources for Green Island .  
As for outsider divers , Mr . Chen has " some thing I 'd like to say " : " They go down to the bottom wearing heavy gear , but do n't understand the nature of the water ; when they 're hit by a sudden current and ca n't get their footing , they end up carelessly grabbing and breaking off and stepping all over and destroying the coral . " But it 's the local fishermen who get stuck with the reputation for destroying the ecology .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
The great air pollution killer - - the motor vehicle : " Development of an electric car is an inevitable global trend , " contends Yang . Whether it be from the point of view of efficient use of resources or from that of environmental protection , the electric vehicle is one of the most effective ways to resolve current pollution problems .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
Recently , Hollywood 's studios made some adjustments to Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid When these fairy tales were produced for the big screen so that the films would better conform with current feminist thinking . In Beauty and the Beast , departing her former meek and submissive image , the character Beauty was depicted as an intelligent , independent , and headstrong woman who liked to read .  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .  
The path was built along the playful , light current of the crisp , green Shakatang River . The little trail runs not far above the river bed . After catching sight of such an unpolluted river , who can resist the temptation to leap into the bubbling waters and swim ?  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
In light of the current situation , the country will need professionals skilled in R &amp; D , foreign languages and simultaneous interpretation ; people who are possessed of an international perspective and are also familiar with the characteristics of international markets ; as well as practical personnel who have a good grasp of such aspects as finance , transportation , and communication in the operation of international business .  
Just a moment ago your bare arms and legs were a little numb from the cold air . Now they 're numb because the heat is making your blood vessels throb , and your whole body is limp . When you ca n't stand that hot current running through your body any longer , just splash yourself with some cold water .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
When she writes about her current home , New York ( especially Central Park ) , or about places she has visited such as Alaska or Egypt , the mood is peaceful and unburdened . The world belongs to the creatures of the sky . The music for this world is written as a series of steady half-notes , occasionally augmented by a graceful glissando of eighth notes .  
It 's a place of dramatic cliffs and gigantic boulders , where white sand beaches meet grasslands . But more than this , its special geographic location puts it in the middle of the Kuroshio current , which runs from the equator and nurtures coral and tropical fish , making for a beautiful and colorful underwater world .  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by . Menacing lionfish , covered with what seem to be thorns and claws , swim along face down . Upon seeing human divers - - what strange creatures ! - - sea snakes swim by and touch their flippers . . . .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
Sincerely , Yen Hsing-chen , Saiitama Prefecture , JapanEditor 's reply : When selecting articles for reprinting in Sinorama , our principal consideration has always been reflecting the multifaceted phenomena and opinions of Taiwan 's society . Our choice of comics is inclined toward those that use a humorous style to reflect the current social conditions .  
Apart from some so-called " armorial porcelain " especially decorated with family crests , what is most interesting is the various kinds of European themes used : for instance , plates bearing humorous pictures to do with current events , like the Rotterdam riot , British elections , and the collapse of the Amsterdam stock market ; there were also biblical and mythological scenes .  
Sam Wen says that the current crop of pro players , when youths in the 1970s , ran all around the world for international competitions , bearing the burden of national pride and struggling for medals . Their growth process was somewhat distorted , leaving them with many habits such as enjoying special privileges , wanting advantages , and having a little too much self-admiration . The players must of course work harder at growing up .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context . " It is very possible that , given a certain atmosphere in society , the interviewee knows very well what the interviewer is aiming at , and just tells him or her what they want to hear , " cautions Wang Ming-ko , an associate researcher at the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  
Ma Kai suggests that one reason for the current rise in frictional unemployment is that , now that Taiwan is wealthy , far fewer young people need to be so careful about hanging on to an " iron rice bowl " ( as secure jobs are called by Chinese ) . In addition , the implementation of national health insurance means that job-seekers have one major worry off their minds . It was thus only to be expected that frictional unemployment has risen rapidly .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
In the current situation , with cross-straits relations being less than ideal , if small and medium sized enterprises are having difficulty growing in Taiwan , we wo n't prohibit them from investing in the mainland . But , if it 's a large enterprise , an important industry , or an infrastructure investment , the movement of these kinds of investments into the mainland one after another is not beneficial to our national development , and we must take more stringent measures .  
It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
The electricity runs through the circuits like the transmitting material in the human nervous system , which allows the brain to remember , select , calculate , and even listen , speak , read , and write , undertaking all kinds of " intelligent " tasks . The applications of the flow of electric current in a circuit are virtually limitless :  
Chienkuo High School , generally recognized as a " star school , " has already determined that its outstanding selected students will not be judged exclusively by the standard of academic grades . Particular emphasis will also be placed on performance in activity groups , in order to " lend balance " to their current student population , whose on-campus activities lean heavily in favor of scholastic pursuits .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved . Further , the PRC 's Taiwan policy-making bodies and its Ministry of Transportation and Communications , which is responsible for handling this issue , are at odds with one another .  
In 1973 , it was generally agreed that jurisdiction over the media should be unified in a single agency . So the Executive Yuan took publication industry affairs from the Ministry of the Interior , and film and broadcast affairs out of the Bureau of Education and Culture , and moved both to the GIO . The GIO doubled in size overnight , assuming its current structure of six departments and three divisions .  
In the records of the late Eastern Han , the " Guanglingsan " was listed as folk music current in the Han and Wei regions , but in the records of the Song , it says " the ' Guanglingsan ' is no longer extant . " Lin Ku-fang points out that the music of ancient China always persisted extraneous to statements whether it was extant or not ; it was preserved in a state so that at times it was hidden , at times evident .  
It can be seen that a multitude of factors affect textbook selection , and that underneath lies a struggle involving power , gain and values . Many of the underlying processes are unknown to the average person , with power and its application being the most important hidden factors . In the current textbook reform , another question which should be addressed is thus " Do our teachers truly have the ability to select texts ? "  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
For example , the monthly base fee for a mobile phone has gone from NT $ 1800 , before market liberalization was announced , to the current NT $ 600 . Use charges have fallen from NT $ 12 per minute to less than half that .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China . Hot topics of current research include such questions as the relationship between Confucianist thought and China 's modernization , and various aspects of Chinese philosophy .  
However , the government 's performance did not meet the expectations of the citizens of Macedonia , and in the third parliamentary elections , held last October and November , a coalition of moderate-right parties organized only half a year ago-led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Party / Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity-won 62 of the 120 seats in parliament . With this majority they formed a new government , and the current premier , 32-year-old Ljupco Georgievski , has become the symbol of a new generation of reformers .  
The waves stirred up when the ROC established formal ties with the Marshall Islands and Macedonia are but one example of the ROC 's and PRC 's diplomatic wrangling . Yet they illustrate clearly the ROC 's current situation in regard to its allies . The most feasible way for the ROC to maintain or expand the number of nations with which it has formal ties is to engage in an economic - and trade-based diplomacy that provides these nations with Taiwan 's ample experience in economic development .  
In fact , because there is nowhere else for hazardous waste to go , under current regulations waste which has been solidified or stabilized , and which passes leaching tests to ensure that there is no danger of toxins escaping , can be buried in segregated areas of city and county sanitary landfills .  
His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
George Newstrom , who is corporate senior vice-president at EDS and chairman-elect of the World Information Services Technology Alliance , spoke on the theme " Preventing the Technological Eclipse of Humanity . " He expressed his concerns about the current creation of " technology for its own sake . " While conceding that technology is a wonderful thing , Newstrom said that the question is : " Can we grow up and learn fast enough to handle the awesome power and potential that technology offers ? "  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
Former president Lee Teng-hui was a devout Presbyterian who said more than once that he planned to do missionary work after he retired from politics . In the early morning three days after his election , current ROC President Chen Shui-bian went to the Nungchan Temple in northern Taipei , where he visited Master Sheng Yen . Chen revealed that he had come there previously to meditate and listen to the master 's enlightened words after Chen had failed in his bid to be reelected as Mayor of Taipei City .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
Moreover , the residents of Tannan village have always supported themselves through farming and manual labor , but the nation 's current economic lull coupled with the presence of foreign labor has caused unemployment rates to increase steadily . The consequences of Typhoon Toraji last year , erosion , and the loss of arable land , have deepened the region 's economic turmoil , further impairing the prospects of reconstruction . At present , only five or six houses are under construction .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
In May of this year , the government formally declared " digital content " to be one of the " twin star " industries . It plans to pour NT $ 5 billion into the industry over the next four years , establish a " digital content college " that will cultivate IT skills among artists and writers , and encourage venture capitalists to invest also in the hope of growing the industry 's annual production value to more than NT $ 200 billion , four times its current value , in five years .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
" Perhaps digital content is no different in its basic nature from the writing , language , physical artifacts and images , and video programs we have long been familiar with , " explains Hwang Tai-yang . But once information of all kinds is digitized , and converted into virtual ones and zeros that can flow as an electric current , there will no longer be any obstacles to its crossing platforms to be transmitted , stored , accessed and used at will .  
Eventually , Min Sheng Daily agreed to add another gig , and the 2500 tickets for that were cleaned out in a single morning . After the event , the emcee , Chen Kai-lun , said that this was the most moving event he had ever hosted . There was not an empty seat to be found , no one left halfway through , and everyone felt as if they were being carried back in time on a genteel current of luxurious music .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
Moreover , Taiwan has an extremely comprehensive economic structure , from agriculture and textiles from the early period of industrialization to later-stage petrochemical and precision-machinery industries to the current information technology , optical electronics , and communications sectors . We have a dense web of up - and downstream economic activities . Moreover , Taiwan 's many small enterprises have organizational structures as flexible and adaptable as changelings , so peripheral support industries and core industries can develop together , and it is very easy to subcontract out work .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
Dance therapists find that the same activity will be expressed in various ways . Some patients act like a bionic man with extraordinary strength , possibly showing violent tendencies . Some appear to move effortlessly , as if they were light as feather . In each case the movement is a reflection of the patient 's current psychological state .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
But it is worth noting that these young people are rather dissatisfied with Taiwan 's current political and economic situation , and most believe they are powerless to affect the overall picture . This survey also points up an important trend : among this generation with its extremely high proportion of highly educated people , education level is a significant variable when it comes to values and dreams . Compared with the past , the dreams and values of highly educated people are driving and guiding the direction of this generation as never before !  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste . As for the disposition of collected kitchen waste , " 70% is used primarily for raising pigs , and composting accounts for 30% , " says Lin Tso-hsiang , section chief for kitchen waste recycling operations at the Environmental Protection Administration 's Bureau of Environmental Inspection . During the current phase , local governments have not been required to institute kitchen waste recycling ; they are merely encouraged to do so .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
After eight years of hard work laying the foundation for the company , artkey executive vice-president Ivan Fan surveys the current scene and gives her analysis . After mainland China joined the World Trade Organization , intellectual property on both sides of the strait benefited from increased international protection . At the same time , another " East Asia fever " is set to grip the world as we come up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .  
According to the fee schedules set by Taipei County 's Cable TV Fee Review Committee , the cost of accessing basic channels will be NT $ 150 per month . If other channels are selected , an additional charge will apply . However , the total may not exceed the current maximum for cable television fees of NT $ 600 . As for video services , users wishing to view other movies or videos will be charged extra for these .  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
The data collected by low-elevation weather stations lacks detailed information on high altitude cloud cover and air current changes , among other things . Although it is now possible to use satellite technology , high-altitude weather balloons and other advanced technology to measure the temperature , air pressure and humidity at high altitudes , the collection of data on such things as visibility , cloud type and cloud height depends on visual observation and can not be achieved by automated instruments .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .  
Shihpai , along with neighboring areas eastward to Tienmu and westward to Kuantu , has traditionally been an epicenter of high-value real estate in Taipei . Following the current resurgence , a realty office franchise sandwiched between a bakery and a hardware store next to the Shihpai MRT station witnesses an endless flow of individuals inquiring about real estate daily from the moment the doors open at eight o'clock in the morning till they close at 11 at night .  
Seeing the industry on the decline hurt him deeply , and when he heard about the Cultural Association 's plan to try and revive it , he leapt straight in , despite not quite getting the idea himself . After reflecting on the current situation-all his children and grandchildren had moved elsewhere to work in other industries , so there would be no-one to carry on the tradition-he decided to devote himself to trying to help rebuild the old farms and give them a second shot at life .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
The world is still in a process of complicated and profound changes , with peace and development remaining the major tasks of the current world , Jiang said Peace and development are complementary and closely related to each other The UN still has much to do before lasting global peace and common development are attained , he added

The conclusions established that , in terms of its current substantive and procedural regulation , habeas corpus is extremely ineffective in protecting fundamental individual rights .  
The Council 's current practices , characterized by the closed and secret nature of the vast majority of the substantive deliberations of its members , make it ever more necessary to meet our demand for an analytical , complete and integral report .  
The panel , balanced in its representation of members , would address this initiative in the light of the current international economic , administrative , regulatory environment .  
A summary reflecting the current arrangements for the accommodation of international contractual personnel and monthly rental costs is contained in annex XI ( h ) .  
The current deficit with regard to the percentage of cases not covered by the maximum allowable expenditures level had been created under the previous methodology , whereby increases were granted on the basis of a worldwide average increase in school costs .  
How Governments and peoples , international organizations and the private sector interact and interrelate will have a major bearing on the efforts of humanity to improve the standard and quality of life for current and future generations .  
They stressed the need for a multisectoral approach and for diagnostic assessment of the current institutional arrangements and human resources capacity at the national level as a basis for formulating strategies for the future .  
For the first time , a consistent , usable , minimum level of current mineralresource information , together with estimates of total undiscovered mineral endowment , will be provided for the entire United States .  
The unencumbered balance of appropriations , $ 34,655,950 gross ( $ 35,247,050 net ) as at 31 December 1993 , will be sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining MINURSO at its current military and civilian strength for a period of some 10 months .  
Based on these logistical factors , the existing UNOSOM aircraft fleet is not sufficient to meet current military and humanitarian requirements within Somalia .  
They stressed the need for a multisectoral approach and for diagnostic assessment of the current institutional arrangements and human resources capacity at the national level as a basis for formulating strategies for the future .  
Three additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1315 ) .  
The Special Commission outlined to the Iraqi side current activities to establish as soon as feasible a workable mechanism and practical modalities for monitoring pursuant to the ongoing monitoring and verification plan approved by resolution 715 ( 1991 ) .  
Four additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1316 ) .  
There has also been a holistic review of the current and future potential of remotely sensed data ( satellite and airborne ) for identification and monitoring of illicit crops ( that is , opium poppy , cannabis and coca ) .  
The current draft guidelines for preparatory conferences in arbitral proceedings , which were intended to foster efficiency and predictability in international arbitrations , were an appropriate complement to existing UNCITRAL legal texts .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and to include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
The probability of sustained current recovery in the industrial countries would be greatly enhanced if the international community could take credible actions to realize the tremendous growth potential of developing countries .  
Such efforts should bring together those responsible for economic , financial and social policy and provide an integrated framework for guiding national and international policies aimed at meeting the current challenges of the world economy .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
It is crucial that the current complementary efforts by national and international organizations involved in mineclearing , mine awareness and education , technical assistance and assistance to the victims of mines be strengthened and accelerated ;  
International justice required independence from the decisions of political organs ; in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
We are aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a region , but there is no alternative to this path of collective self-reliance if our region is to survive in the current competitive international economic environment .  
We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
However , there is no doubt that progress towards a lasting , just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the continued , determined and coordinated efforts of the international community in the maintenance of a global approach to the current peace initiative and the continuation of the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime .  
The end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued the world during the cold war and the disappearance of the ideological demarcation line that divided the world into two camps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunity afforded us by the current transitional period to lay down new foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrow the economic gap between them .  
In the current thinking about the necessary reform measures , it is vital to keep in mind the reality of the dynamic change in the global economic and social spheres , the ever growing importance of market forces and the global nature of the changes .  
The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important in the historical development of the United Nations , not only because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional institution of universal scope , which was established to analyse , debate and seek solutions to problems of common concern to mankind , but also because current circumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the future of our Organization .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
In this spirit , before I described some specific reform recommendations my delegation is advancing in connection with the current agenda item , it would be helpful to the Assembly 's consideration of these ideas for me to preface them with four essential points : the diagnostic framework ; the historical context ; and the premises and the paramount objective that underlie our proposals .  
Therefore , in that regard , my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee , given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee 's work is progressive , innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social , economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration , and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
We have also formulated our laws and our development , economic and social policies on the basis of the principles of equality and justice and the lofty Islamic shariah , in accordance with the current changes in the international environment and in an attempt to achieve our various national objectives in the social , economic , and cultural fields .  
The Assembly , considering that nuclear testing was not consistent with undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference , deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground nuclear testing and sharing the alarm expressed internationally , regionally and nationally , would strongly deplore all current nuclear testing and urge the immediate cessation of all nuclear testing .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
It also dispatches the strong message to the countries involved in current nuclear testing that the international community neither welcomes nor approves of their outdated , digressive and intolerable behaviour .  
The Secretary-General 's report is a technical compilation of the answers received from some States , without its own input and without the views of so many competent international organizations that are daily preoccupied with current and future developments in the Balkans .  
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .

Supreme Council expressed its deep appreciation and gratitude to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman and to the Government and people of the Sultanate of Oman for the gracious hospitality and sincere sentiments of brotherhood with which the leaders of the Cooperation Council were received and commended the distinguished arrangements and important role played by His Majesty as President of the current session of the Supreme Council and his excellent conduct of the meetings , which had a major impact on arrival at the important and fruitful conclusions achieved at this session .  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
Through its current operation Israel has demonstrated once again its utter contempt for Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , as well the Charter provisions and principles of international law governing relations between States . My delegation regards this military action , which has brought about scores of casualties among the civilian population , particularly among women and children , as unconscionable . 
It is my delegation 's hope that our deliberations today , as well as the current intensive rounds of diplomatic efforts , will help bring about such an outcome , for the vicious cycle of violence and bloodshed which has bedeviled the Middle East must be broken and a comprehensive and just peace based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) must be realized .  
The view was expressed that , for financial reasons and in the interest of improved efficiency and effectiveness , subsidiary bodies that had been granted an exception to meet away from their established headquarters should be invited to review their need for the exception in the light of the current situation of their work .  
He also drew attention to some remaining difficulties such as the possible additional resources that Conference Services would need for the editing , translation and printing of the supplement , the heavy burden that the concentration of the review work within a single division would place on that division and the priority to be given to other urgent responsibilities in the current period of financial crisis and diminishing resources .  
The ever-dwindling natural resource base , global warming , persistent droughts and desertification are eloquent reminders that humankind 's current destructive processes of growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice .  
First , the current of the East Sea would have steered a drifting vessel in a northerly direction , while the North Korean submarine moved southwards , against the current , nearly 60 miles south of the demilitarized zone before running aground at our coast near Kangnung .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
If it is first and foremost up to the African countries to demonstrate that their marginalization is determined only by fate and that their current situation is merely one of those tragic aftermaths with which history has frequently sprinkled the course of human events , then it is also up to the international community as a whole , in active solidarity , to make a special commitment to supporting the efforts of the African countries to deal with the challenges before them .  
We must undertake major structural reforms , enlarge the Security Council membership in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution , and improve the functioning of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies , so that they can respond adequately to current regional and international developments .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
My delegation therefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoing discussions at the current meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the creation of a special fund aimed at considerably reducing the multilateral debt of poor countries under structural adjustment result in a successful outcome .  
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
If the developed countries are demanding protection for their sensitive domestic industries , then similar demands by developing countries with respect to their domestic industry should not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or inconsistent with current international trends .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
Looking at current economic , social and political conditions on our continent , including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin , one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
First , in the health field , action is under way to reach the target of eliminating poliomyelitis ; salt iodization is being implemented ; the rate of maternal mortality has decreased from 143 in 1989 to 107 in 1995 for every 100,000 live births ; 93 per cent of all children have been vaccinated and immunized against hepatitis ; studies and evaluations have been made to supplement current child nutrition information ; and health plans have been drawn up to promote future health care .  
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
Under no circumstances would it be politically justifiable not to promote corrective measures in all areas or to move the United Nations , at an appropriate way , closer to the effective promotion of an alternative model of development so as to ensure compatibility between the required social changes and the current opening up of our economies .  
If the amendment presented by Iraq , as contained in document A / 51 / L . 11 , concentrates only on positive aspects , we consider that operative paragraph 7 in its current formulation does not accurately reflect the delicate balance between positive and negative aspects , particularly as outlined by the Director General in his report and as stated in the IAEA resolution on the subject suggesting more positive than negative aspects .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members . The ultimate objective of reform can not be reduced to cutting costs or just addressing the current financial crisis .  
The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
Despite continuing difficulties , a basis had now been laid for a qualitatively new political and psychological climate in the region that opened the way for the peaceful coexistence of Palestinians and Israelis and the attainment of specific results in the current negotiating stage , which was both complex and sensitive . 
Capital spending has been the main engine of growth in the current cycle , with non-residential fixed investment in 1993-1995 rising at annual average rates of close to 14 per cent in real terms .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Fully convinced that an enlarged membership is desirable in order to take advantage of the current propitious international climate to negotiate and conclude , on the solid basis of a more representative participation , a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and other important agreements requiring universal adherence ,  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
Other initiatives which his delegation was presenting to the General Assembly at the current session concerned the protection of minorities , which called for enhanced international cooperation to defuse conflict situations ; attention to the specific needs of children and juveniles in conflict with the law in the context of human rights in the administration of justice ; and the plight of internally displaced persons , in respect of which the work of the Secretary-General 's representative on that question had been crucial .  
Therefore , paragraph 4 of the draft resolution stated that the General Assembly noted with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of indebtedness , stressed that non-payment of undisputed debts reflected badly on the entire diplomatic community , reaffirmed that non-compliance with contractual obligations could not be justified or condoned , and endorsed the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;  
The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
To enable timely procurement of essential goods and services required for new missions and the maintenance of ongoing missions , and in order for the Controller to exercise the authority granted under financial rule 110.6 ( Commitments against the appropriations of current and future financial periods ) , relevant criteria , restrictions and new procedures were introduced during January 1995 to facilitate requests for use of this authority in certain key areas of procurement for peace-keeping operations .  
To provide information , within the Security Commission , on the respective military and public security expenditures approved in their budgets for the current fiscal year , taking as a reference the " Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures " adopted by the United Nations on 12 December 1990 , under the provisions of article 52 ( k ) of this Treaty ; and ,  
To consider the information provided by the Governments on their respective military and security budgets for the current fiscal year and to elaborate joint proposals for the possible adaptation of future budgets , taking into account the internal situation of each State ;  
In its report to me , the team concluded that , in the current context of violence and instability , United Nations guards would not be able to guarantee the security of humanitarian personnel in Burundi ; indeed , in the present environment , the guards could themselves become potential targets for extremist groups , thus intensifying the security problems already faced by the international humanitarian effort .  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
The entire operation , encompassing both the preparation of initial studies and the subsequent review and coordinating work , is , as indicated above , carried out with resources only available after more urgent tasks have been accomplished - a situation which is the result not of a deliberate decision but of necessity , inasmuch as the demands on the Secretariat units concerned are for the most part of a current nature and can not be subordinated to work on the Repertory ;  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
It is apparent from the comparative data provided that over time , changes in the number , scope , scale and complexity of peace-keeping operations , as well as the considerations outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 above , have affected and rendered less meaningful the pragmatic validity of the current methodology and funding formula for the support account and its ability to generate a sufficient , assured and stable level of resources , which is necessary to support essential backstopping functions at Headquarters .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
My country welcomes the Secretary-General 's current report , which some contains very positive and encouraging elements regarding the United Nations Mission in Haiti and congratulates UNMIH for the progress achieved during the fulfilment of its mandate , as set out in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) , to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a safe and stable climate , to protect international personnel and essential installations , to ensure the desired conditions for the holding of elections and to create a new professional police force .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
While it was clearly stated in the draft resolution as presented that the request for additional meeting time for the Committee should be considered by the General Assembly within the overall existing budget framework , the Secretariat was obliged to make a statement on financial implications in view of the current financial situation faced by the Organization , namely , that : " In adopting the programme budget for 1996-1997 , the General Assembly decided that savings of $ 103.9-million were to be achieved in the programme budget during the biennium .  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
The Government of Guatemala considers that the foregoing reaffirms the mutual trust between the parties that characterizes the current phase of the negotiations , and reiterates its commitment to achieve as soon as possible a negotiated political solution to the internal armed confrontation , in order to strengthen the building of a firm and lasting peace .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
While the United Nations system continues to provide technical cooperation assistance and advisory services of a neutral and non-commercial nature in the field of mineral resources at the request of Member States , its ability to do so has been severely diminished owing to evolutions in the funding of technical cooperation activities , and current budgetary reductions and the financial situation in the United Nations Secretariat .  
The Committee may wish to consider these new approaches and perhaps recommend additional paths to pursue as regards the environmentally sound development of mineral resources for the purposes of implementing activities in the area of mineral resources , given the current budgetary constraints under which United Nations organizations are operating and pursuant to their specific mandates . 
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
The growth and the current vast size of the international capital markets , along with the ease of capital mobility across borders , have come to exert considerable influence on national monetary and exchange rate policies , occasionally threatening the stability of either one or the other .  
In its resolution 1995 / 27 , section II , the Council requested the Secretary-General to consider the feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national legislation in crime prevention and criminal justice and its implementation , taking into account the current and planned capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network and the activities of other United Nations entities and relevant intergovernmental organizations .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
The requested oral report on the status of an interregional workshop to formulate a pilot project ( for an appropriate region ) which should develop standard approaches to the identification and qualitative assessment of permissive tracts and be based on geographical information system technology , that would allow integration with other land management information will not be presented due to the current financial situation of the United Nations , which has prevented the workshop from being financed and prepared . 
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
In addition , the documents were prepared on the following subjects : protection aspects of UNHCR activities on behalf of internally displaced persons ; comprehensive and regional approaches to refugee problems ; recommendations of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) / UNHCR Symposium on Refugees and forced Population Displacements in Africa ; and the scope of international protection in mass influx ; as well as a note on current UNHCR activities on behalf of stateless persons .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
In keeping with the options I outlined in my report to the Council of 19 January 1996 , and pursuant to resolution 1042 ( 1996 ) , I sent a technical team last month to examine the current functions of the MINURSO military component and to determine whether its size could be reduced , while still permitting it to play an effective role in monitoring the cease-fire and verifying allegations of violations . 
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
It would be an illusion to think that this innovative model of peace-keeping will be able to succeed in Liberia , especially under current conditions , unless sufficient and reliable sources of funding are provided to ECOMOG , and unless the force is strengthened and structured in a manner that will enable it to carry out its tasks as a professional peace-keeping force .  
SORIEUL ( International Trade Law Branch ) said the text of subparagraph ( b ) would be retained in its current form ; the Guide would be amended to indicate that the definition of EDI included the manual exchange of electronic data on diskettes , provided the data was structured in a format agreed upon by the parties .  
At the same time , the financial benefits of common premises are not evident in all cases , particularly if a move into joint premises can not fully accommodate all operational requirements , or if various current premises are provided by the Government free of charge as part of its in-kind contribution to the organizations , or if opportunities for appropriate premises are scarce and initial costs of moving are significant .  
The unsatisfactory housing situation was attributed to a number of constraints , including the lack of a national housing policy and implementation strategy reflecting current and prospective economic realities , inadequate delivery of land for housing , the lack of financial mechanisms that cater to the needs of the low - and middle-income groups , and high construction costs in relation to incomes .  
ECLAC studies in international trade , transportation and the financing of development focused on the design of policies and mechanisms to foster the continued expansion and improvement of the commercial linkages of Latin America and the Caribbean with the changing world economy , particularly in view of the current trends towards globalization in production and increasing liberalization of trade and finance .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
Moreover , while the refusal to allow Argentine citizens to reside in the Malvinas Islands dated back more than a century , the current policy barring the immigration of Argentines reinforced the long-time and persistent policy of denying the entry of Argentine residents and capital , in contrast to the international trend towards regional integration and the free movement of persons , including in conflict areas .  
While these figures are lower than in previous cycles , they should not be construed as indicative of future trends , but rather as a temporary phenomenon , reflecting UNDP efforts to reposition itself to become a more responsive and effective organization as it adapts to current development realities and challenges .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
With regard to the progress that has been made since registration in relation to exploration , it is proposed that a workshop / seminar be convened to assess the current state of deep seabed mineral exploration with a view to determining if there are any outstanding technical issues to be overcome as well as to provide the Authority with a clear set of guidelines for work that may be expected of a contractor in a plan of work for exploration approved in the form of a contract ( stage I of the exploration plan ) . 
In any event , this objective will have to be pursued while preserving the current capacity of the text-processing units to ensure the timely issuance of documentation in all languages simultaneously , working with generally very short deadlines and operating within the present framework of reduced staff resources and drastic limitations in the use of overtime .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements , prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management , shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .  Today I received a copy of a message sent by the Government of Burundi to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , inviting them to increase the number of human rights observers , since the current Government ,  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The health issues included in the Platform for Action were already part of the Ninth General Programme of Work of WHO and technical programmes have continued with their activities as planned although , given current resource constraints , substantial additional funding is not anticipated .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
Activities being initiated include reviewing the current state of interpreting modelling work for sustainable development ; formulating recommendations for improving existing integrated modelling work for sustainable development ; developing a linked set of models for integrated global and regional assessments of sustainable development ; stimulating the development and use of integrated models in developing countries ; and providing support to relevant activities of different bodies . 
While the eradication strategy relied heavily on the use of insecticides to reduce or interrupt malaria transmission and attempted to eliminate infection through case detection and treatment , using the same approaches in all areas , the current strategy aims to control malaria disease through early diagnosis and prompt treatment , including improving the management of severe and complicated malaria , controlling epidemics and using preventive measures that are locally effective and sustainable .  
In its request for a legal study , the Advisory Committee envisaged a two-stage process : an examination of current procedures on the basis of which the Secretary-General , in the course of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , would develop and propose means of ensuring a simple , efficient and prompt settlement of third-party claims , of limiting the liability of the Organization , protecting its interests and allowing for a coordinated approach of all United Nations organizations , agencies and programmes .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
If steps are not taken to curb the fighting , then the current situation in the West Bank , which has turned into a grim confrontation between organized forces , may do immeasurable damage to the already shaky efforts for a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region .  
The strengthening of the monitoring , internal audit , inspection and evaluation , and investigation functions provided for in the resolution is an important and integral part of the Secretary-General 's management plan , as outlined in his current and his previous annual reports on the work of the Organization , and is all the more essential at a time of major resource constraints .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
With the increased level of insecurity producing newly displaced persons daily , the United Nations system remains concerned that current stockpiles will be depleted and major shortages of essential relief items will soon occur .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
The recommendation in paragraph 50 of the Committee 's report , to the effect that in future scales of assessment , all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum rate of 0.001 per cent , should be implemented as soon as possible .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
In the current circumstances of technical cooperation , when the demand for traditional longer-term expert assignments is decreasing while rapid-response short-term specialized consultancies are preferred , the Department is of the view that recruitment practices should not be excessively rigid .  
Some delegations , noting the current tight resource environment for multilateral development , supported the position of the Advisory Committee for Administrative and Budgetary Questions ( ACABQ ) that the additional requirements for the establishment of the country office in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the revised 1996-1997 budget , should have been absorbed within currently appropriated budgetary resources .  
Mr . MAHUGU ( Kenya ) , after endorsing the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that while current economic indicators revealed widespread world economic growth , with the developing countries having registered an aggregate GDP growth of over 5 per cent , that growth rate concealed sharp regional , subregional and national differences .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
In closing , he said that , although the current climate of stability and economic progress was promising , it would not be lasting unless it served to open opportunities for all persons and that the crucial link between economic and social development and the efforts to enhance the dignity of mankind made the Fund 's work a truly meaningful task .  
However , CPC had been unable to reach agreement on the content of that document at its session in June 1996 and had recommended that the Secretary-General be asked to present to the current session of the General Assembly , through CPC at its September session , a short and concise document to be considered for inclusion in the proposed medium-term plan based on relevant resolutions and decisions of intergovernmental bodies and taking into account the views expressed by the members of CPC .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
It is important that an effective mechanism be established , so that international actors and the authorities can discuss issues of common concern on a regular basis , share information on current activities and take joint decisions , especially on how best to meet the needs of vulnerable groups .  
While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .  
That being said , it was obvious that there were still dramatic variations between regions , and the question was whether the current relatively robust growth in the developing countries as a whole would translate itself into a widespread improvement of living conditions and especially into poverty reduction worldwide . 
With respect to article 4 of the Convention , and in the light of the current difficult economic situation , the Committee emphasizes the importance of the allocation of resources to the maximum extent possible for the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights of the child at both central and local levels , in accordance with the principles of the Convention , in particular those relating to non-discrimination and the best interests of the child ( arts . 2 and 3 ) .  
The current period has been particularly important for this new international organization : the principal organs of the Authority - the Assembly , the 36-member Council and the Secretariat - have all been established , together with the subsidiary expert bodies , and the organizational work required to assume the substantive functions entrusted to the Authority by Part XI of the Convention and by the 1994 Agreement has been initiated .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
The dispute settlement mechanism provided for in those articles represented a bold step forward in the progressive development of international law , for the doctrine on dispute settlement had traditionally been based on consent to or free choice of means of settlement , whereas the current text made recourse to conciliation compulsory if either party rejected the other options .  
I have the honour to inform you that an extraordinary session of the central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution at ministerial level was held today , 11 November 1996 , at Addis Ababa to consider the current crisis in the Great Lakes region with special reference to eastern Zaire .  
New , often very complex tasks in insecure living / working environments , especially for staff employed by humanitarian agencies , and mobility in both function and location are the main features of the current work of the international civil service .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
INCERA ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group 77 and China , said that the strengthening of oversight and audit functions was a fundamental means of achieving the efficient , transparent and responsible management of the Organization 's resources , particularly in the light of the current financial crisis .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at the 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
It is committed , independent of extreme events , to combat racism and xenophobia over the long term , producing publications ( brochures , posters and pamphlets ) every year on symbolic dates such as 21 March ( International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ) , 3 October ( German Unity Day ) and 10 December ( Human Rights Day ) , suggesting action to be taken , engaging in public relations , through statements in the press , on current topics , and submitting petitions and claims to political bodies .  
Phase 1 contains basic gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices , broken down by final expenditure and kind of economic activity .  
The Department of Public Prosecutions is taking the measures necessary to strengthen and develop the Office by increasing the number of its staff , providing it with an adequate number of highly qualified and experienced personnel to ensure the rapid performance of the administrative work concerning current cases in question being handled by the Office , and providing it with the modern technology in order to facilitate the collection and publication of statistics required for the serious monitoring of those cases .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
Bearing in mind that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to address the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking , inter alia , resettlement to reintegration programmes in order to strengthen further the process of national reconstruction and development ,  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
The following questions arose concerning the current system : the extent to which placement and promotion were tied to merit ; whether the promotion process could be improved to reward performance ; how open decision-making was in that area ; what changes were practical and desirable in policies and procedures ; whether the functioning of the appointment and promotion bodies could be improved ; and whether programme managers could be held more accountable for placement and promotion decisions .  
In this context , he felt sure that delegations had come to the current session of the Board not to fulfil routine representational formalities but , stimulated and motivated by the in-depth and solid analytical reports prepared by the secretariat , to hold a serious dialogue on issues that were of primary concern to their policy-makers .  
Developing countries ' growing leverage in the global trade system was based on raw economic power : they currently accounted for a quarter of world trade and , if current trends continued , this figure could reach 40 per cent by the year 2010 and over half by 2020 .  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
On the question whether the scope of the draft articles should be extended to include other activities not prohibited by international law that did not involve the risk of significant transboundary harm but that nevertheless caused such harm , her delegation considered that , at the current stage in the progressive development of international law , the draft articles should cover all situations that might entail the strict liability of States for lawful acts .  
Letter dated 20 November 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Zimbabwe to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General , transmitting a joint communiqu entitled " The current international trading system and prospects for the promotion of trade among developing countries " , released at the sixth meeting of the Summit Level Group of Developing Countries , held at Harare from 3 to 5 November 1996 ( A / C . 2 / 51 / 10 ) .  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
These criteria are set out in the current criteria for assignment and promotion published in administrative instruction ST / AI / 413 , which provide , inter alia , that paramount consideration must be given to performance , competence , efficiency and demonstrated potential to perform at the higher level .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
On the other hand , it has been strongly emphasized that the establishment of networks of existing small scientific facilities should also be high on the agenda for strengthening international cooperation , particularly in geomagnetic studies , electrojet current measurements , solar photometry , astrometry , galactic mapping and optical astronomy .  
A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
It is incumbent upon the international community to make a concerted effort to make sure that the Greek Cypriot side abandons its current confrontational posture before it is too late , and starts engaging in meaningful dialogue with the Turkish Cypriot side , within the framework of your good offices mission , in the interest of a peaceful solution in Cyprus .  
Revisions were made to improve data quality in the following items : ( i ) data on " children ever born " and " children living " should be collected by sex ; ( ii ) " date of birth of the last child born alive " was introduced to replace " live births within the 12 months preceding the census " to measure current fertility ; and ( iii ) " deaths in the 12 months preceding the census " was added to measure current mortality .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Some delegations expressed their thanks to JIU for preparing an excellent study and described it as a high-quality analytical document , as well as a valuable and timely contribution to the current restructuring process in the economic , social and related fields of activity of the United Nations system .  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
In view of the current serious situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , the Committee intends to encourage renewed , intensified efforts by non-governmental organizations to organize and coordinate sustained campaigns in order to inform public opinion and to promote national and international action in support of United Nations resolutions and the Committee 's objectives .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
From 1995 to the present SELA has accomplished a fundamental reorientation and adaptation in order to achieve two main objectives : first , to help the 27 members become integrated into the current international environment and , secondly , to coordinate their agendas for regional , hemispheric and international actions .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
All of these factors combined make it vitally important that the international community mobilize its efforts to achieve a rapid settlement while continuing to provide needed humanitarian and material assistance in other words , we need a comprehensive strategy for rehabilitation to go with the current ongoing efforts to settle the problem of Afghanistan .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
A paradox arises in that , while globalization may be considered desirable because of the potential beneficial effects on national economic growth , at the same time , current levels of growth and dynamism in a particular economy may determine whether the effects of globalization are positive or negative .  
Inspired by the purposes and principles of the Damascus Declaration , and on the basis of the role played by member States in promoting Arab solidarity , advancing the interests of the Arab nation and safeguarding joint national security ; in response to current requirements , and in the light of international and regional developments , particularly with regard to the peace process , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs affirmed their absolute commitment to work in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Arab Summit Conference held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June 1996 .  
The Conference welcomes the fact that the United Nations approaches racism by examining incidents characteristic of contemporary forms of racism , incidents which unfortunately seem to be on the rise throughout the world , aggravated by economic and social problems and the current universal decline in moral standards .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
The current approach to energy policy worldwide , which is characterized by a strong emphasis on energy supply , without regard to its social , economic and environmental consequences , does not meet the requirements of sustainable development .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .  
In view of the accelerated deterioration of the situation in Burundi and the current crisis afflicting the Great Lakes region , the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that , during the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , a special day should be devoted to considering all the problems confronting the subregion , culminating in the adoption of a joint resolution , in accordance with the wish expressed by the three Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
It was agreed that technical experts , including experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , should be invited to the fifteenth session of the Working Group , in 1998 , in order to identify and study the current international technical standards pertinent to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .  
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
Having completed its preliminary consideration of the legal issues and possible provisions to be considered in uniform rules on digital signatures , as reflected in part II of the present report , the Working Group noted that , for lack of sufficient time , it could not enter into any detailed discussion of the issues of incorporation by reference at the current session . 
The Director , DAMR , is concerned that the authorized level of resources are not sufficient to meet his current audit and oversight responsibilities within acceptable professional standards of an average cycle of once every five to seven years .  
The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .  
He agreed that periodic reviews of the Model Law would be desirable because of the particular nature of the subject matter and the rapid technical changes that could be expected ; for that same reason it would also be useful for the current text to be described as the " 1996 version " of the Model Law .  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
In part , this would be due to rising income and per capita consumption , overall export growth , moderate inflation and modest current account deficits projected for South , East and South-East Asian countries . 6 To some extent , it can be anticipated that there will be a further intensification of regional cooperation within the various institutional arrangements currently in existence .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .

While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
At the current stage of geological and geotechnical knowledge of the site , there are favourable prospects for the technical feasibility of the proposed tunnels at an acceptable level of assurance , this being understood in the context of the practical needs for detailed information and the practical difficulties of meeting those needs through off-shore surveying .  
At the beginning of the current decade , economic growth proved to be lower than projected in the baseline economic growth scenario , which was drawn up in the light of the trends observed during the period 1980-1990 and on which the traffic projections are based .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Noting that the current , severe maldistribution of income prevents millions from enjoying economic and social rights and that gross inequalities prevent social harmony , Mr . Eide added that the focus of his report was rather on the impact of different structures of international and national income distribution on human rights . 
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
An extensive debate encompassing a wide range of secular and religious views was in fact under way concerning assisted reproduction ; the current restrictions had been introduced by the previous Government .  
The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .  
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
Senior staff of the Buildings Management Service inspected the current office arrangements and acknowledged that there was a need for additional office space ; however , they also indicated that the Fund 's requests had to be considered in the context of the amount of space required and the desired location ( the main Secretariat building ) , and the competing requests from United Nations departments and offices for contiguous space for their operations .  
Recognizing , however , the importance of agricultural development no only for people living in rural areas but as an engine of growth , the Bank had formulated during the past year a new action plan for rural development , designed to address current problems and to provide a new and dynamic framework for future Bank activities in that area .  The plan had just been presented to the Bank 's Board of Directors .  
Those elements included the improvement of current bilateral transit agreements , the promotion of a complementary comprehensive subregional agreement and international transit conventions and agreements , the development of alternative routes , the commercialization of transit services and the development of potential for expanded subregional trade .  
I have the honour to transmit to you herewith decision 001 / 97 , dated 19 July 1997 , whereby the Constitutional Council of the Republic of the Congo , noting that it was impossible for the Government to organize the presidential elections scheduled for 27 July 1997 , decided to postpone such elections and , accordingly , to extend the mandate of the current President of the Republic until the proclamation of a successor elected by universal suffrage , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution in force in the Republic of the Congo .  
First , at no stage previously had all the available information on the issue been assembled for comparison and review ; second , no thorough study of the applicable United Nations Staff Rules had been undertaken to assist in the determination of whether the case was one of an actual conflict of interest or rather an apparent conflict of interest reflecting a common-sense application of just and reasonable behaviour ; third , the report must be detailed and legalistic to allow the United Nations to understand the insufficient nature of the current conflict of interest rules .  
It should be easy to understand why the Government of the Republic of Burundi objects to the talks being held in the United Republic of Tanzania , the fundamental reason for this objection being the current tension resulting from the problems caused by the refugee camps set up all along the shared border by the United Republic of Tanzania , just a dozen or so kilometres from Burundi , which are regularly used as bases for bloody incursions into Burundi territory . 
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
There are effective family planning programmes , with universal coverage and no account taken of marital status or whether the relationship is stable , although they could be better if we have available enough different types of contraceptive for each case , and in sufficient quantities ; supply is a problem under current economic circumstances . 
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
The mission focused on balancing real radiological risks against economic , social and psychological problems , and generating together with the authorities of the concerned countries realistic projects with a high likelihood of success , leading to measurable improvements in the current conditions under which the population was living .  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
The Commission also recalled that the current level of the ceiling ( 25 per cent of net salary ) was based on an administrative decision and that a reduction of the ceiling would be beneficial to duty stations with a large non-pensionable component since a lesser proportion of income would be considered non-pensionable and the relationship between income while in service and income after service would improve . 
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
The Dominican Republic attaches special importance to the ongoing reform process , given that it is capable , while respecting the principles and purposes that gave birth to the Organization , of ensuring a more democratic , transparent , representative and efficient system capable of facing the current challenges , especially those of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the peoples of the world .  
In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
The debate and negotiations that took place during the three sessions of the Working Group held in 1997 covered , in a balanced way , the substantive and diverse issues included in both clusters , and demonstrated the complexity of this process of reform which , despite opposing interests , the vast majority of Member States hope will produce a Security Council that represents the current composition of the Organization and effectively responds to the future challenges of the United Nations .  
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
Those who are familiar with Central American history and aware of our current efforts in the various fields of integration know that Central American union is not simply an act of faith ; it is , rather , a work of engineering , an enormous undertaking that , taking into account the unique qualities of each of our States , is the key to the exercise of joint sovereignty .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close . 
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .  
Her Government 's approach to advancing gender equality was based on the recognition that gender was a factor in the nation 's current social , economic , cultural and political systems and that the unequal status of women had its genesis in and was perpetuated by systemic causes . 
In view of its coordinating role , the Commission called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services of the Secretariat , the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , also as part of current programmes in the field of good governance and institution-building , utilizing the expertise of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
The emergence of an active biochemical prospecting market can provide an additional means of converting the potential future value of biodiversity into current income for those most responsible for , and most affected by , the preservation of biologically diverse ecosystems .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,

According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
The assessment team meets with interested parties , both governmental and non-governmental , in close cooperation with the United Nations Resident Coordinator , United Nations agencies and programmes , as well as local donors , and compiles detailed information on current policies , legislation , and human and financial capacities in key areas .

The recent statement of Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterating Israel 's absolute sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Jewish people which will never again be divided typifies the uncompromising and brazen attitude of the present Israeli leadership , not the statesmanship that would have been more appropriate , and that is expected of it in the current delicate situation .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in those areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , particularly in developing countries .  
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;

A list of the 27 agreements of continuing validity , current as at 27 November , appears in annex I . Taken together with the provisions of the Croatian Constitution , those agreements , for which the Government of Croatia has made itself internationally accountable , provide a comprehensive political and institutional framework of guarantees , which , if fully implemented , will allow the people of the region to exercise freely their rights and obligations as equal citizens of Croatia . 
At least at the current stage of the Commissions work on the topic , the functional protection extended by international organizations towards their agents should be considered along with diplomatic protection per se , since the initial results would supply the clarification needed for the subsequent adoption of a final decision on the inclusion of functional protection .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
The United Nations Security Coordinator formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Organization on current and potential security-related problems and is responsible for coordinating , planning and implementing inter-agency security and safety programmes and for acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation . 
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
Some delegations expressed their thanks to JIU for preparing an excellent study and described it as a high-quality analytical document , as well as a valuable and timely contribution to the current restructuring process in the economic , social and related fields of activity of the United Nations system .  
It is of the utmost importance that the Commission be granted the necessary financial means to start operating as soon as possible , in order to maintain the current momentum in favour of clarifying the past so that the country can move forward in the daunting tasks of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and , in the informal sector , as workers in free-trade zones , as prostitutes or as overseas contract workers .

While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;

The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
Without an effort of that scope and significance , and without a solution to such fundamental problems as the external debt of the African countries , the vast majority of those countries would be unable to overcome the difficulties arising from their current critical economic situation and the accumulation of serious social problems caused by marginalization .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .  
The Forum recognized the region 's vulnerability to natural disasters , environmental damage and unlawful challenges to national integrity and independence and reaffirmed its commitment to take a comprehensive , integrated and collaborative approach to maintaining and strengthening current mechanisms for cooperation among members in dealing with threats to the security , broadly defined , of States in the region and of the region as a whole .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .

At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .  
The unlawful acts committed in respect of all materials or items covered by the current draft also include unlawful acts committed in respect of nuclear material in peaceful use the subject matter covered by the Physical Protection Convention .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
During their extended phase , all current projects would continue to address several common themes and issues critical to enhancing impact at the grass-roots level and improving the living conditions of poor and disadvantaged people .  
Another attractive feature of the ARGOS system is the small transmitters : the average daily electric current required is as low as a few milliamperes ; miniaturized models can be as compact as a small matchbox , weighing as little as 20 grams .  
The forward rate would be free to differ from the current spot rate and a growing forward discount on the spot exchange rate ( assuming interest rates remained unchanged ) would be an indication of expected future depreciation of the spot rate .

While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .

There are many obstacles to resolving the acute problems and to raising public awareness of the need to protect the environment during the current period of financial difficulties and economic instability coupled with poverty and weak discipline .  
He said that the current economic outlook for Africa was not encouraging , as the region was suffering from the effects of the international financial crisis , reduced export demand and falling commodity prices .

The fact that Ethiopia started this current offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of the current offensive contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it .  
The fact that Ethiopia started this offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it , ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of its current offensive .  
On the contrary , Japan was of the view that , despite the changes in the world economy , the institutions which had been established at Bretton Woods had played a vital role in containing the current crisis and that , far from scrapping them , the international community should concentrate on improving them so that they could perform the functions which they were expected to perform in the new global economy .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
Follow-up action has focused on the preparation of teaching materials and the translation of the United Nations standards on criminal justice in the national language for law enforcement officials , examining current penal and banking legislation and creating an effective implementing mechanism , strengthening analytical and operational capabilities , improving inter-ministerial cooperation and enhancing international mutual assistance . 
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52 / 227 , requested the Secretary-General to take appropriate action to reduce the dependency on the current contractor and to ensure that a comprehensive programme for IMIS training is included as part of the ongoing training programme , and that adequate and qualified staff are assigned to the implementation and operation of the system at all duty stations .  
As we know full well , current armed conflicts almost always reflect historical accumulations of unsatisfied demands , in most cases aggravated by inadequate social and economic situations and by international political and economic conditions .  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
Generally speaking , however , the current extent and types of protected areas , particularly in densely populated regions , are deemed insufficient to achieve sustainable forest management due to both internal and external factors .  
Request countries , with the support of international organizations , particularly UNEP and the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , to make a comprehensive assessment of the current status of protected forest areas , including total number , extent of each area , objectives of establishment , effectiveness of management , IUCN system equivalent category , and basic biological and social information available ; 
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
Until the causes of the current vulnerability of the international economy were determined , it should not be forgotten that the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the implementation of far-reaching institutional reforms were essential for the achievement of comprehensive and equitable social and economic progress .  
The Committee is still concerned , however , that the current data _ collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
His country therefore welcomed the outcome of the intensive negotiations held in September and October 1998 and was convinced that the current draft convention represented a positive development with respect to the international communitys endeavours to prepare a universally accepted instrument to curb or eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism .  There were , however , a number of issues that needed to be clarified and settled .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .  
In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
Proceeding from strategic objectives formulated in the programmes adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women and from the countrys current state of economic and social development , the Government convened in March 1996 a national forum on women in social development , with a view to upgrading the level of competence , living conditions , education , qualification and culture of Mongolian women and to expanding their involvement in development and progress .  
Being cognizant of the importance of focusing upon the family , which is the primary unit of any society , and on economic entities in the fight against poverty , the Government orients its activities towards changing the current inert status of poor families living below the poverty line , as mere recipients of aid .  
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
At the same meeting , I reminded the Foreign Minister that the Group of Experts had carefully considered the feasibility of a national tribunal , but concluded that the Cambodian judiciary in its current state was unlikely to meet minimal international standards of justice , even with external assistance .  
We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .  
The main objective of this measure is to maintain a modern legal framework which responds to the current economic and social situation by helping to consolidate our economic and commercial liberalization process , and thus facilitating investment and trade ;  
On the current international scene , overwhelmed by an information revolution , the media must disseminate objective and impartial information , taking into account the unique social and cultural traditions of each region and acting with a sense of professionalism , ethics and responsibility .  
The negative aspects of the current economic situation must be reduced to a minimum and the enormous potential of the global market must be harnessed .  
Convinced that the magnitude of current difficulties called for additional measures for resolving the debt problems of the developing countries , Norway had launched a new national strategy which , in addition to supporting and strengthening already existing multilateral schemes , included bilateral debt reduction measures that would be implemented over and above the reductions granted under multilateral operations .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
With regard to the question posed by the delegation of the United States , he wished to make it very clear that there were two aspects to the issue of the minimum age for recruitment and that they were inseparable : the current standard was too low and must be raised , but that should not prevent it from being applied .  
It should be borne in mind that the current situation of millions of children in many parts of the world remained critical as a result of poor economic and social conditions , poverty , armed conflicts , the exploitation of child labour and the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , and that the number of children infected with HIV / AIDS had risen at an alarming rate .  
Many indigenous representatives expressed the view that the forum should be established as a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council , while other indigenous representatives considered that it should be linked to the Economic and Social Council , in one way or another , although they were not in a position to identify the exact placement in the system at the current time .  
They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .  
The status of IAEA verification activities in Iraq is unchanged from that reported in document S / 1999 / 127 , which was provided as a summary document to facilitate the work of the panel on disarmament and current and future ongoing monitoring and verification issues established pursuant to document S / 1999 / 100 of 30 January 1999 . 
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
For many transition economies , the scale of restructuring required by the shift from central planning to competitive markets is so large that the domestic economic , political and social institutions , which are also in a state of transition , are unable to cope with the adjustment costs , which in turn may generate large-scale resistance to reform ( the study of Romania in the current Survey provides a telling example of this ) .  
The 1999 World Survey provides a synoptic and statistical outline of the current economic and social status of women and of some emerging trends in the 12 critical areas of concern of the Platform for Action . 2 Based on existing data , it highlights the areas where visible progress has been achieved , compared to the situation three decades ago . 
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
Additionally , the lack of effective and cohesive institutional leadership of the United Nations Office at Geneva ( UNOG ) common services has weakened its central role in Geneva and deprived it of visibility and identity , leading to its current performance problems .  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
As indicated in paragraph 73 , as well as in table 3 , of the report of the Secretary-General , it is anticipated that , when the proposed enhanced system becomes operational , total biennial communications expenditures of the United Nations under the regular budget would amount to $ 12.5-million-4 / as compared to $ 16.1-million , and that , in respect of peace-keeping operations , current biennial expenditures for communications , which amount to $ 22.8-million , would be reduced to $ 7.2-million .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that the post had been classified internally at the P-5 level in 1992 and that the current classification action had been initiated in view of the managerial responsibilities of the post , which had grown with the increasing use of contractual services , involving an annual average of some 45,000 pages and an annual budget in excess of $ 1-million . 
The Council expressed its appreciation of the numerous dmarches and tireless and effective endeavours of President Yasser Arafat at Arab and international levels , which have produced qualitative developments in the position of every State in the world with respect to the State of Palestine , have established that State 's international legitimacy ever more firmly and have advanced its current and future relations .  
Following current practice in cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
Efforts will be intensified to secure reviews of UNDP special reports and other substantive studies in international and national development-related journals and academic periodicals in order to heighten visibility of the contribution made by UNDP to the intellectual debate on current issues of concern to such readership circles .  
It indicated that in current circumstances Iraq would be unable to export oil and petroleum products in sufficient quantities to realize the total sum established for phase IV under resolution 1154 ( 1998 ) because of the limited productive capacity of the oil sector and the sharp fall there had been in oil prices in world markets . 
Mr . Qin Huasun ( China ) ( spoke in Chinese ) : China is deeply disturbed by the current humanitarian crisis in the Balkans and has profound sympathy for the over 700,000 Kosovar refugees who have been left homeless and separated from their loved ones .  
Although globalization is driving the current economic and sociological evolution of the industrialized world , regional cultural identity still represents an extraordinarily strong force in the world .  
The Council informed Mr . Rugova of its current efforts to solve the Kosovo crisis through a political settlement that would provide for the safe return of all refugees and for substantial self-government for Kosovo within the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and help abate the overheated nationalist sentiments now prevailing in the area .  
In many countries , the United Nations ( resident coordinator / UNDP resident representative ) , the World Bank or often the two together convene meetings with donor and national government representatives to exchange information on current and planned programmes and discuss critical policy issues .  In some countries which use the consultative group mechanism , the resident coordinator chairs regular meetings of locally represented donors , while the World Bank convenes the consultative group itself .  
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .  
This has been achieved by making relevant amendments to the Access to space action area , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by it in this connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
The role of the customary areas is to be enhanced by the revision of their current uncertain legal status and by the creation of customary institutions endowed with powers at the local and national levels .  
In presenting a budget that broke through the half-billion dollar mark ( the estimated revenue for 1999 / 2000 is expected to total $ 551.6-million ) , 3 the new Finance Minister said that expenditures would be focused on improving the quality of life for all Bermudians . More than $ 511-million was to be spent out of the countrys current account , which is about $ 36-million more than the last projection . 
A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
Support to member States to improve their national statistical services has taken the form of advisory services in the areas of statistical organization and management and improvement of basic economic statistics to promote capacity-building , as well as technical publications designed to apprise countries of the region of current approaches and best practices .  
In particular , given the unsatisfactory nutritional situation prevalent in Iraq and the necessity of providing a full food basket on a monthly basis , and also taking into account the effects of the current drought , it is essential to keep under constant review the funding level of the food sector .  
In the statement , the Ministers agreed that one of the key lessons for Africa of the current crisis is the need to strengthen supervisory and regulatory mechanisms to ensure transparency in financial transaction and improve corporate governance , in consonance with the principles of financial liberalization and the development of financial and capital markets .  
She informed the Committee that the pre-session working group had before it draft lists of issues and questions prepared by the Secretariat in accordance with decision 19 / III of the Committee , based on an analytical comparison of current reports of States parties with previous reports , the Committees discussion thereon and other relevant information , including concluding observations of other treaty bodies .  
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
Secondly , such a narrow definition of treaties and treaty-making would impede ( or even preclude ) any proper account of indigenous views on these issues , simply because of the widely _ held rationale that indigenous peoples are not States in the current sense of the term in international law , regardless of their generally recognized status as sovereign entities in the era of the Law of Nations .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
Having completed his research , the Special Rapporteur considers that it may be useful to review the above list , so as to determine - at least provisionally - what would be the most practical and fruitful means ( i.e . treaty / agreement renegotiation and / or proper implementation , constructive arrangement , resort to international bodies , or some other formula ) of constructively approaching , in the future , the wide array of current situations confronting those peoples mentioned above .  
During short-term microgravity experiments on board aeroplanes , research will be conducted on the correlation between the electrophoretic direct current field and the variable gravity field with electrophoretic instruments for continuous free current stream in space and equipment for life science experiments on manned space missions will be developed and relevant scientific research initiated .  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Our current population strategy , which was defined in the declaration on population policy adopted in April 1988 and elaborated in the eleventh orientation plan for economic and social development , was also inspired by the Dakar / Ngor Declaration adopted in the capital of Senegal during the Third African Population Conference .  
This calls for new and additional resources from donor countries and international financial institutions to complement national efforts and resources for the further implementation of the noble principles of the ICPD Programme of Action and to reverse the current decline in overall official development assistance .  
Despite the fact that it has slowed in many countries , the current rate of demographic growth will , in the coming decades , have a considerable impact on economic , social and even political stability in numerous developing countries which are already enduring serious difficulties .  
The current IMF-monitored economic programme put in place in November 1998 as a follow-up to the 1997 / 98 programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and make further progress in the area of structural reform while the political situation settles , and while a possible new enhanced structural adjustment facility programme is being considered .  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
To be effective , such a policy initiative would need to backed by funds which are additional to current aid flows , and it should be accompanied by measures in the form of technical and other assistance to ensure that national administrations are in a position to effectively undertake expenditure devoted to social purposes .  
The rapid liberalization of financial transactions in developing countries without sufficient prudential regulation was an important element in the onset of the current financial and economic crisis .  
Affirms that the informal consultations on measures to ensure international protection for all who need it have proved to be a valuable forum for constructive discussion of complex protection issues in an open manner ; and requests UNHCR , in consultation with States , to continue to organize from time to time , within the limits of available resources , and with broadly based participation , informal expert consultations on protection issues of current concern .  
The Committee is concerned that the current data collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
These limited opportunities had largely been due to the fact that a significant portion of market access opportunities had been allocated to pre-selected countries , which were historical exporter countries ( according to the current access opportunity provision ) and / or countries that received preferential treatment under regional or bilateral trade preferences ; and the TRQ system had not been administered transparently and had been inefficient in achieving the full utilization of TRQs . 
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
The common overall objective among developing countries in the next negotiations , experts agreed , was to maximize the potential benefits to developing countries from the continuation of agricultural reform in the multilateral framework by correcting perceived shortcomings of the current Agreement which seemingly put developing countries at a disadvantage in international agricultural trade .  
This requires addressing difficult and controversial issues such as schoolgirl pregnancy , adaptation of the content of educational curricula and textbooks to the objective of equipping girls with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to avoid early pregnancy , and broadening the objectives and purposes of education to provide the future generations of women in Uganda with options unavailable to the past and current generations of women .  
Accelerating current initiatives and [ taking / adopting United States ] additional actions to reduce substantially the debts of [ developing countries , particularly United States would delete ] the heavily indebted low-income countries , [ by speeding up the process , by relaxing the eligibility criteria and by broadening and deepening / improving and enhancing existing measures within the current framework of Japan ] the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative ;  
In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
The main objectives outlined in the 1999 consolidated appeal process are to prevent the current humanitarian emergency situation in southern and central Somalia from developing into a dramatic famine , and to continue to foster stability , self-reliance and security in the north .  
Furthermore , participants in the conference considered that the current and future international trade agenda , such as the upcoming negotiations on trade in services , was of crucial importance for the partnership between the public and private sectors in both originating and destination countries .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
An expeditious accession process for the least developed countries which were not members of WTO , on terms consistent with their status , was seen as an integral part of their efforts to reverse their current marginalization in world trade and to become integrated into the world economy and international trading system .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
In this regard , it stressed that the current forms of cooperation involving the public and private sectors of developing countries should be built upon and expanded , and also stressed the importance of identifying barriers and restrictions to the transfer of publicly and privately owned technologies .  
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
In the current stage of global developments , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
Within its current severe financial and staffing constraints , the Institute has been able to implement a modest but promising substantive programme of work , thus demonstrating its institutional potential and proving its capability to fulfil its unique role in pursuit of the advancement of women and gender equality .  
The current political context , however , is unfavourable , particularly since those elected will in all likelihood be disinclined to take part in such a seminar until the elections have been held and parliamentary commissions established .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
At the current level of knowledge , the problem is still very much open-ended ; the available methodological approaches do not provide straightforward and unequivocal assessments ; and in the absence of sound and indisputable estimates , the level of subjective judgement is often above an acceptable threshold .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
Nor can we overlook the fact that the current unjust and unsustainable international economic order continues to treat Africa as an economically undeveloped source of natural wealth , that serves the unsustainable consumption patterns of industrialized countries , among which are included the former colonizers .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
Commodities continue to provide an important economic starting base : they have a high value-added component ; agricultural commodities are an important source of employment and offer scope for anti-poverty campaigns ; and agriculture frequently acts as a buffer against economic problems and allows the return to rural areas of urban unemployed , as in the current crisis .  
In particular , given the unsatisfactory nutritional situation prevalent in Iraq and the necessity of providing a full food basket on a monthly basis , and also taking into account the effects of the current drought , it is essential to keep under constant review the funding level of the food sector .  
The report of the second panel concerning the current humanitarian situation in Iraq ( S / 1999 / 356 , annex II ) , had referred to the qualitative dimension of the impact of the sanctions and to the cumulative effects of sustained deprivation on the psychosocial cohesion of the Iraqi population as indicated by an increase in juvenile delinquency , begging and prostitution , anxiety about the future and lack of motivation , and a rising sense of isolation .  
Expressed appreciation to the countries that participated in the current round of reviews ; to the senior officials from capitals who engaged in open , frank and meaningful dialogue and shared valuable experience with other Governments - - which could also benefit from the process - - and to the international private sector ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
Although the current scale of assessments had been blamed by some for the Organizations financial difficulties , that scale had been based on extensive negotiations among all Member States and had proved to be fair and reasonable in practice , since it basically reflected the Members capacity to pay .  
In general , however , the current international situation was propitious for enhanced economic cooperation between nations and a more determined effort to eliminate the many obstacles still standing in the way of the growth and progress of the developing countries .  
While considerable progress had been made towards the development of an open , non-discriminatory , secure , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system , much remained to be done ; his country , which was heavily dependent on foreign trade , had suffered greatly from the remaining inequities in the current system .  
Without an increase in development assistance funding , it would be impossible to meet all the current major challenges ranging from international debt , education and health to access to knowledge for the promotion of economic and social development .  
The scale of the financing required ruled out the possibility of continuing the current practice of making voluntary contributions on an ad hoc basis ; a more reasonable and transparent formula for sharing the burden would be needed .  
Providing organizations the opportunity to indicate whether they could absorb the costs of the activities being requested within current and / or successive programmes of work and budget , or whether such activities could only be carried out if additional financing was provided , would avoid the risk of diversion of resources or staff time from the programme of work and budget approved by its governing bodies , while contributing to more consistent and coherent governance by Member States .  
On one of the current sticking points the transboundary movement of living modified organisms intended for consumption or transformation her Government advocated a differentiated solution taking account of the constraints of the international market and the particular situation of developing countries .  
In order to ensure that the benefits of globalization were enjoyed by all countries , rich and poor , it was essential to adopt and promote a multilateral approach by reshaping the current structure of the existing international institutions and their regulatory mechanisms . 
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
While noting that the dimension of the IDP crisis in Colombia has turned into an overwhelming challenge for the Government , national and international participants profoundly lamented the IDP populations current situation of insufficient access to food , shelter , clothing and medical care and called upon the Government to expedite these basic services .  
It should be noted that the current proposal to include mine action in the assessed budget of the peacekeeping mission is specific to the situation in Kosovo , and the adoption of this principle will not affect or change the way in which existing mine action programmes supported by the United Nations are funded , generally through voluntary contributions to established trust funds .

The Advisory Committee notes the statement , in paragraph 4 of the note by the Secretary-General , that general temporary assistance , in addition to being used to replace staff on maternity or sick leave or to ensure adequate staffing during peak workload periods , is used to fund specific positions which are associated with some degree of uncertainty as to the need for them to be retained in the definite future , either at their current level or in their current pattern of grades and categories . 
An analysis of the adjustments in current account balances undertaken in its aftermath had suggested that they had been undertaken by the worst possible means not through a virtuous cycle of export expansion leading to market growth but through a vicious cycle of import repression , generating losses in export values because of the combined inflationary effects of demand contraction , excess supply and currency devaluations .  
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .

The Commission continues to believe that the existence of a national border in close proximity to the duty station makes Geneva a distinct situation which justifies the current post adjustment system , which was tailored to reflect that difference ; the legal , administrative , and technical difficulties associated with any of the above-described changes to the current arrangement militate strongly against implementation of those changes .  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .

Unless the imposition of cultures and artificial borders by colonial Powers is recognized as an essential historical factor in many current conflicts and unless the right to independence and self-determination is accepted and the diversity of cultures and models comprehended , conflicts will continue .

My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
The draft resolution is also silent on the current impasse in the Conference on Disarmament due to the inflexibility shown by a few delegations on the questions of nuclear disarmament and outer space , ignoring the express wishes of the vast majority of its members , which support the commencement of substantive negotiations as part of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work .

The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .

As one member of the Commission had stated , paragraph 2 in its current form was too broad and left the door open for any junior official to formulate a unilateral act that would more than likely be invalidated subsequently .

First , the peace process in the Congo has lately witnessed a number of consecutive steps that have served to maintain the current momentum aimed at implementing the Lusaka Agreement in both its military and political components and at reaching a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict , which has been tearing the Congo apart and draining the energies of its neighbours for almost three years .

Sharon and Barak through all their declared and expressed statements and positions that run counter to international law and that call for escalation and confrontation .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .

The conclusion that can be drawn at the present stage is that , despite worldwide awareness of the dangers of a pattern of globalization which , in its current form , constantly widens the gap between rich and poor and contributes to the marginalization of increasing numbers of countries , particularly in Africa , there is still no clear determination in the international community to take decisive action and devote the necessary resources to attain the noble and ambitious goals established by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit .  
After consideration of the various views expressed , the Commission decided that the question of the desirability and feasibility of preparing a model law or model legislative provisions on selected issues covered by the Legislative Guide should be considered by the Commission at its current session . 
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .

Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .

This dire prognosis is based on the analysis of the current epidemiological situation in Georgia and neighbouring countries , all of which are experiencing widespread drug abuse , increased migration , and lack of disposable medical instruments and diagnostic test systems , among other factors .  Currently , Georgia is still within the so-called window of opportunity for preventing the massive spread of HIV / AIDS .  
A salient feature of that programme was organizing periodic seminars / symposia to focus attention on specific issues falling within the framework of disarmament and development in the context of current international relations , as well as providing a forum where relevant United Nations bodies , non-governmental organizations and other international agencies could share their experience in areas of common or overlapping concerns .

Welcomes the current participation in the capacity of observers of those Non-Self-Governing Territories that are associate members of the regional commissions in United Nations world conferences in the economic and social sphere , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions , including resolutions and decisions of the Assembly and the Special Committee on specific Territories , and in the special sessions of the Assembly ;  
UNFPA agreed to organize the eighth Round Table on Communication for Development , scheduled to take place from 26 to 29 November 2001 in Managua , Nicaragua , and proposed the following three central issues : evaluating the information programmes designed to halt the HIV / AIDS pandemic ; development of methodologies to evaluate current communication programmes ; and using community radio to reach the disadvantaged .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The detailed and extensive analysis comprised aspects relating to the evolution of mercenaries over time , the means employed by mercenaries , the most visible cases of such activities , the problems raised by the current definition of mercenary under international law and ways of strengthening the United Nations in pursuing its aim to put an end to mercenary activities throughout the world .  
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
Based on experience to date , the current funding level of the operational reserve , targeted at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year , appears sufficient to meet the requirements originally included in the definition of the operational reserve .  
The Council concluded its high-level segment with the adoption of a Ministerial Declaration which expressed grave concern that if current economic trends continued , the majority of African countries would be unable to achieve international development goals .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires , inter alia , a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of ODA ) , to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
Human solidarity and social justice will ultimately win out over the egoistic , unjust conceptions that serve as pillars of the existing international economic order , aggravated by the neoliberal precepts imposed on the current globalization process . 
Cuba believes that the lack of political will on the part of a significant number of developed countries and their decision to protect the unjust foundations of the current international economic order have been the determining factors in the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Group .  
The Government of the Republic of Cuba is confident that human solidarity and social justice will prevail over the selfish and unjust concepts underpinning the current international economic order , which are aggravated by the neo-liberal theories imposed by the current process of globalization .  
These included : the worsening of the food security problem ; the structural difficulty of achieving competitiveness within the current international agricultural markets ; and the strong dependency on exports from this sector for the acquisition of hard currency .  
The current political process might seem slow , but the sensitive nature of the issues involved and the far-reaching implications for the countrys future made it vitally important that the National Convention proceed slowly and systematically in order to safeguard the interests of all the national races and to avoid replicating the shortcomings of the two previous Constitutions .  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions should strengthen their support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop borders post , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
The main goal of the interim programme is to break the inflationary spiral and put a stop to the current distortions in the economy , through a tight budgetary policy and a monetary policy compatible with the chosen goals . 
Thus the weighted average of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita ( estimated at current official exchange rates ) is estimated to be $ 0.65 per day for the total population in African LDCs and $ 0.88 per day in Asian LDCs in the late 1990s , whilst in PPP terms ( in 1985 international prices ) it is estimated to be $ 1.51 per day in African LDCs and $ 4.59 per day in Asian LDCs .  
Once the revised budgets for missions in transition ( UNMEE , UNAMSIL , MONUC and UNIFIL ) and for the support account for peacekeeping operations , with the proposed resource requirements resulting from the comprehensive review and capacity study , have been considered by the General Assembly , budget levels are projected to increase over the initial current level of $ 1.7-billion to some slightly in excess of $ 3.0-billion for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 .  
In our view , the Conference on Disarmament is a precious resource because , even in its current situation , it offers more space than any other forum for official multilateral dialogue on issues of concern .  Yet , questions are raised - for example , is the Conference on Disarmament a creature of the international security environment that awakes from its enforced hibernation only when there is adequate change in that environment ?  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions , should strengthen its support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop border posts , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
It had four guiding principles : African ownership of development goals , objectives and policies ; the mutual responsibility of African countries and their development partners for achieving shared objectives ; the provision of long-term donor support , taking into account the diversity within and among African countries ; and a bold and comprehensive plan for Africas irreversible emergence from its current fragile state .  
In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the Special Representative recognized that any assessment of the current human rights situation must take into account the degraded economic and social situation that was inherited by the democratically elected administration in October 2000 .  
Through the New African Initiative , African leaders have drawn a road map for a new relationship between Africa and its development partners based on guiding principles which include a focus on African ownership of development goals , objectives and policies ; the mutual responsibility of African countries and their development partners for achieving shared objectives ; the provision of long-term donor support , taking into account the diversity that exists within and among African countries ; and a bold and comprehensive plan for Africa 's irreversible emergence from its current fragile state .  
The Security Coordinator also formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Secretariat on current and potential security-related problems , coordinates , plans and implements inter-agency security and safety programmes and acts as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation regarding security .  
In the current conducive environment , such measures contravene all laws , principles and norms governing international relations in the field of global trade and directed towards the enhancement of extensive commercial and economic interactions among countries .  
However , favourable external conditions were equally necessary ; the current international economic system must be reformed to meet the challenges of globalization and growing interdependence among countries and made more equitable by increasing the decision-making power of the developing countries .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .

The theme of the dialogue , entitled Responding to globalization : facilitating the integration of developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century , was considered to be particularly important and timely in the context of the current global economic slowdown , and emphasized the urgent need for poverty eradication strategies .  
It is time that the necessary political will is displayed by those countries whose ambiguous positions have led the Conference on Disarmament to its current comatose state , so that the Conference can be activated to fulfil its intended role as the single multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament .  
He hoped that the Committees discussions at the current session would help to promote the role of the United Nations in designing and coordinating development policies and programmes in developing countries and to revitalize an approach to international development and social cooperation that was based on equality among peoples and the right of States to choose their own development course and achieve a better future for their societies in accordance with their independent national policies and interests .  
Given that the current difficult situation could be overcome only by a combination of adequate domestic policies and an enabling international environment , the Committee must review the main economic issues and identify areas for cooperation .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
It was therefore the urgent duty of the international community to combat two current threats to development and common security poverty and HIV / AIDS . Governments themselves must be the driving force in pursuing a policy that would embrace the economic and social factors affecting development . 
An unrepresentative and anachronistic Council that does not reflect current global realities would find it extremely difficult , notwithstanding its worthy intentions , to effectively and credibly tackle this momentous challenge to international peace and security .  
Previous global forum events organized by UNIDO have highlighted the need to address the missing links in the current international development agenda and have emphasized , in broad terms , the complementary measures that need to be taken .  
At the current session , an acceptable solution might be to have a summary prepared of the discussions held on the different budget sections in the informal consultations and to request the heads of the departments and offices concerned to be present at those consultations during the discussions on the relevant sections .  
Stresses the need for partnership among Governments of the affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized companies to promote training in , access to and use of technologies to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters , and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed ;  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .  
The role of science and engineering in the current policy-making process at national and global levels regarding the three pillars of sustainable development social , economic and ecological is insufficient .  
In order to meet the requirements of the above-mentioned grants cycle and new requests for funding received during a current year , new voluntary contributions should be paid by donors to the Fund by the end of November in order to be duly recorded by the United Nations Treasurer in advance of the annual session of the Board . Contributions which can not be recorded before the session of the Board will be carried over to the following year .  
This has been achieved by making the relevant amendments to the Access to space action area by the appropriate means and mechanisms , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by Argentina in that connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
Mexico was taking an active part in the work of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group of Ministers or Their Representatives on International Environmental Governance , whose work , which consisted of making a detailed analysis of current institutional weaknesses and future needs and options in terms of strengthening international environmental governance , would contribute significantly to the Summits preparatory process . 
At the special session of the General Assembly in 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 , it was acknowledged that considerable progress had been made at the national level but that , at the same time , there was an urgent need to address the lack of fulfilment of the international commitments voluntarily entered into by developed countries either to assist developing countries or to meet their own obligations on account of their historical industrialization as well as their current unsustainable patterns of production and consumption .  
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of all international human rights treaties , the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States and the continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration ;  
Creation of a database of regional level indicators that would make it possible to evaluate and diagnose the current state of the environment in the region ; gauge the environmental consequences of existing macroeconomic policies ; measure the economic , social and environmental costs of maintaining current development patterns ; and supply orientation for policy decisions , especially in regard to public and private investment .  
The task of preparing for the arrival of external drilling contractors for the almost 400 new wells planned is an enormous one , requiring numerous access roads , earth-moving and foundation works to allow access to the incoming drilling units and to construct , repair and maintain surface facilities required to treat current and future crude oil production flows before export or refining can be undertaken .
