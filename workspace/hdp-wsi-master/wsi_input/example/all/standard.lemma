At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade .

Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Chienkuo High School , generally recognized as a " star school , " has already determined that its outstanding selected students will not be judged exclusively by the standard of academic grades .

He has frequently gone overseas to represent his local area in international aboriginal singing and dancing performances .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
In those days everything was at a high standard of performance . Performers had to undertake formal study with a master for three years and four months .

There were also dynamic scenery and props such as " real rainwater pouring down " and " the bottomless coffin " ( so the " deceased " could get out and suddenly pop up elsewhere ) .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih .

With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired .

In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis .

Master Hongyi is the fourth major work that Siong Leng has put on since 1993 . The story line departs significantly from the typical love stories featured in most nanguan works , and Siong Leng also breaks significant new musical ground by moving beyond the standard four instruments ( pipa , dongxiao , sanxian , and erxian ) to include an entire Chinese orchestra . The group also parts from tradition by incorporating folk dances into the play .  
Take for example the class for outstanding students in math and science .

When necessary , they undertake deeper and broader learning activities . The goal is to develop students with the ability to think creatively and with a spirit of scientific research .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .

The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
And Tan Hong-hui , head of the Lee Giong-chiu Taiwanese Language Foundation , describes the debate over Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin as " an effort to decide which rotten apple is preferable . " Tan 's primary concern is that an inappropriate choice of a standard romanization system could have an adverse impact on future efforts to teach Taiwanese to school children . Hanyu Pinyin is based strictly on Mandarin , and ca n't be used to represent some of the sounds in Taiwanese .  
Entrusting the work to a " B team " was less than ideal , and managerial woes were compounded by the vast diversity of China , with its hundreds of millions of people , where any effort by the Taiwanese to impose a standard way of doing things tended to generate discord . " The way it 's done in traditional manufacturing industries in Guangdong province , using migrant workers and applying military-type management techniques , can be effective , " says Grow Lin .  
Hsiao Tsu won her case , but the judge ruled that there was no concrete basis for her NT $ 15 million claim , and also said that one can not demand future education funds in a lump sum , and consequently rejected this claim in favor of one based on a standard selected by the court .  
The standard work week when President Chen took office was 48 hours . After the new government proposed to shorten this to 44 hours , the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan one-upped the administration by passing legislation that further reduced standard working time to 84 hours over two weeks . This measure saddled businesses with an extra burden , and manufacturing operations began migrating offshore at an accelerated rate , thus contributing to increased unemployment .  
Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
Apart from a more diverse choice of agricultural produce , customs duties on imported motor vehicles will be cut by 30% , and many large supermarket chains have already signed agreements with mainland Chinese manufacturers to import large quantities of products such as electrical appliances at bargain prices .

There were also dynamic scenery and props such as " real rainwater pouring down " and " the bottomless coffin " ( so the " deceased " could get out and suddenly pop up elsewhere ) .  
Currently , the problem is that " there are no rules of the game . Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired .

In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets .

Master Hongyi is the fourth major work that Siong Leng has put on since 1993 . The story line departs significantly from the typical love stories featured in most nanguan works , and Siong Leng also breaks significant new musical ground by moving beyond the standard four instruments ( pipa , dongxiao , sanxian , and erxian ) to include an entire Chinese orchestra . The group also parts from tradition by incorporating folk dances into the play .  
Take for example the class for outstanding students in math and science . Teachers have carefully created a systematic curriculum , designed diversified teaching activities , and produced supplementary educational materials and lectures not part of the standard textbooks .

Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
And Tan Hong-hui , head of the Lee Giong-chiu Taiwanese Language Foundation , describes the debate over Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin as " an effort to decide which rotten apple is preferable . " Tan 's primary concern is that an inappropriate choice of a standard romanization system could have an adverse impact on future efforts to teach Taiwanese to school children . Hanyu Pinyin is based strictly on Mandarin , and ca n't be used to represent some of the sounds in Taiwanese .  
Entrusting the work to a " B team " was less than ideal , and managerial woes were compounded by the vast diversity of China , with its hundreds of millions of people , where any effort by the Taiwanese to impose a standard way of doing things tended to generate discord . " The way it 's done in traditional manufacturing industries in Guangdong province , using migrant workers and applying military-type management techniques , can be effective , " says Grow Lin .  
Hsiao Tsu won her case , but the judge ruled that there was no concrete basis for her NT $ 15 million claim , and also said that one can not demand future education funds in a lump sum , and consequently rejected this claim in favor of one based on a standard selected by the court .  
The standard work week when President Chen took office was 48 hours . After the new government proposed to shorten this to 44 hours , the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan one-upped the administration by passing legislation that further reduced standard working time to 84 hours over two weeks .

Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .

But social work postgraduate student Chen Chin-jung , who is writing her master 's dissertation about foreign brides , maintains that its more an exchange than a purchase . In her view both the Taiwanese bridegrooms and their foreign brides are seeking in the other an opportunity to fulfill a need of their own . The men want the opportunity to marry and start a family , while the women are seizing a chance to improve their standard of living and to better themselves . This makes each of them the best choice in the other 's eyes .  
However , an even greater breakthrough is the way the integrated curriculum redefines the " textbook . " In future both the approved textbooks now used in elementary schools , and the standard textbooks used in junior high , may be relegated from their leading classroom role to a supporting role , for " diverse teaching materials " and " school-developed courses " are another big change introduced by the new curriculum .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
One of his happier finds was a map of Formosa created in 1940 by a famous cartographer . It was an extremely important find , for this was the very map that became the standard for subsequent cartography on Taiwan .

Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
In point of fact , the development of technical and vocational education can not be considered in isolation from the motivations of broader education policy . At a time when standard universities and colleges seem unsure of their own development and are establishing an increasing number of money-making , functional departments , they have begun to impinge on a market formerly considered the preserve of vocational schools . Little wonder then that concerns have been voiced that measures introduced by the Ministry of Education will gradually result in the collapse of technical and vocational education .  
Taiwan 's recording industry took off in the 1980s . Pop songs began to come in all flavors , and the old paradigm , in which a few representative songs reflected the sentiments of a given era , fell by the wayside . Instead , talented writers began producing music and lyrics for all kinds of emotionally charged events . Even the literary community got into the act , thereby raising the standard for this kind of song .  
Luo Ta-you penned the song 's music , including its simple , fluid melody . The lyrics , meanwhile , represented the collective effort of a group that included Luo , Lee Shou-chuan , Chang Ta-chun , Sylvia Chang , Chiu Fu-sheng , and Jan Hung-tze .

In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff .

Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
On April 26 of this year , while Taiwanese society was reeling from the shock of the sudden SARS outbreak , Yeh Chin-chuan , a professor at Tzu Chi University , Hualien , received a letter asking for help from the staff of Taipei 's Ho-ping Hospital . Stirred by a physician 's urge to help others , the following day he rushed to the hospital , which had already been sealed off , to investigate the infection foci and to set up standard operating procedures to combat the epidemic .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine .
