Negotiation content include not only barter trade , but have also added items such as cash trading , economic and technological co-operation and capital and technology introduction , etc .  
The Chinese Government believes that issues like the space for Taiwan conducting external economic , cultural , and social activities which are compatible with its capacity in the international community , the political status of Taiwan authorities , and so on can all be ultimately resolved within this framework , through political negotiations , and during the process of peaceful reunification .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .  
We must regard WTO accession as a fine opportunity to augment , readjust , and perfect China 's existing laws , regulations , and policies related to external economic work , speed up the effort to build and put on a sound basis the legal system of our economic and trade laws , and make full use of the means of law to protect our legitimate interests . 
the western regions have been under large-scale development ; the country 's opening up has been expanding with each passing day ; and the day of acceding to WTO [ World Trade Organization ] is drawing near all these have provided implementing the strategy of national rejuvenation through science and education with a limitless objective demand , an inexhaustible internal motive force , and a favorable external environment .  
The key to Taiwan 's ability to maintain a relatively stable economic situation on the island under the financial crisis since July 1997 lies in the mainland 's stable economy , firm Renminbi , and vast consumer market , which have stabilized Taiwan 's trade with and investment in the mainland and thus stabilized Taiwan 's external trade to ensure normal functioning of the island 's economy .  
The garrison has introduced an external spokesman system and has regularly held Open Day at its barracks with an eye on enhancing understanding or communication between itself and the Hong Kong public .  Practice has shown that the garrison has established fine , harmonious , and mutual-trust army-government relations with the SAR government and has forcefully safeguarded a high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Hong Kong SAR in such a special environment as " One Country , Two Systems " .  
Over the last five years , in the face of all difficulties arising in the very complicated internal and external environments and economic ad social life , we have always regarded speeding up development as a basic guiding ideology in the economic work , upheld employing methods of development to revolve issues in our forging ahead , adopted a series of policies and measures to promote economic developments , and maintained relatively fast speed developments . 
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
Compared to the rather complicated and profound changes of last year , the international situation this year has been relatively stable with no major collisions .  What is particularly conspicuous is the fact that various countries have been making adjustments to their internal and external policies that are oriented to the new century .  
The government has strengthened contacts and consultations with the United States , European Union , and some other major trade partners with an eye on securing a stable external environment for Macao 's export trade .  In the meantime , the government has also actively helped transform traditional industries and has ensured that Macao 's products will keep abreast with global development and remain competitive .  
[ Dai ] According to the major tasks and work plans set by our party and country for the new century , our initial plan is that the party 's external work at the beginning of the new century should become an important component of the integrated strategy of safeguarding the country 's comprehensive security , promoting its total democracy , and realizing a complete national reunification .  
Faced with an ever-worsening internal and external security situation , Russia has carried out readjustments to its diplomatic line and pursued a more active and pragmatic foreign policy , in a bid to restore Russia 's great power status and its influential role in world and regional affairs .  
Based on the Law of Officers on Active Service in the People 's Republic of China , by implementing systems of officer selection from ordinary universities and colleges , promoting outstanding soldiers and graduates through military academies , the practices have broadened the selection resources of military officers through both channels of internal promotion : military training and external recruitment from ordinary schools of high learning .  In this way , the basic qualities of prospective officers have a sound basis .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
On 29 April , Li Ruogu , assistant president of the People 's Bank of China and deputy Chinese director of the IMF , called on developed countries to make greater effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , maintain the stability of exchange rates between major currencies , and thus create a better external environment for economic growth in developing countries .  
While China and the United States were entangled in a diplomatic stalemate due to the plane collision incident , a play was put on the stage in Washington : Jasuwant Singh , Indian minister of external affairs and concurrently defense minister , was visiting the United States at the invitation of US Secretary of State Colin Powell . The Pentagon also held a grand welcoming ceremony for him , including the reviewing of honor guards .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
In addition to the ongoing economic restructuring and the changes in the external economic environment , the worsening economic situation in Taiwan was mainly caused by the turbulent political situation , the confused financial and economic policies , the uncertainty in cross-strait relations , and the shaken confidence among the people after the new government took power .  In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
At a seminar today , Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China noted : This year , the general international economic environment is unfavorable to economic growth in developing countries , and that will have a rather great impact on economic development in major countries and regions in Asia . Therefore , Asian countries and regions should strengthen cooperation , overcome the unfavorable effects of the external environment , and strive for the steady development of their national economies .  
Dai Xianglong analyzed and said that the breakout of the Asian financial crisis had not only internal factors , but also many external factors .  After the Asian financial crisis , various Asian countries intensified their in-depth structural adjustments and financial reorganization , handled bad assets , lowered the debt rates of the enterprises , directly or indirectly promoted economic recovery and growth , and basically maintained the stability of financial operation .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
Jia Chunwang , minister of public security , recently inspected work in Guangdong and required that local authorities in all parts of the country deeply advance the strike hard anti-crime campaign aimed at cracking down on syndicated crime and criminal organizations with the Mafia characteristics , and in particular , resolutely deal blows at the infiltration of the external underworld .  
In coping with external military threats , Russia , which is resolutely opposed to NATO 's expansion to the east , has put forward a proposal for establishing , with European countries , a rapid reaction force to maintain the security of Europe . Moreover , Russia has held many large-scale military exercises with the Commonwealth of Independent States and established a " collective air-defense system " in the western part of Russia .  
As a matter of fact , in analyzing the major cause to the chaotic political situation in Taiwan , the public opinion and some political and academic figures on the island pointed out in the same way without prior consultation : First , in the past year since the leader of the Taiwan authorities took office , he has not taken actual measures to relax and improve cross-strait relations and to dispel the people 's misgiving about his seeking " Taiwan independence " and this has caused the Taiwan society to have an unstable external environment .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .  
Although the external environment for exports in China 's foreign trade in the second half of the year may become even more complicated , we should notice that the international market is still expanding and there is still room and huge potential for the country and different localities to increase exports .  To reach the 8 percent growth set for the year 's exports is completely possible if hard efforts are exerted .  
An expert said that China 's steady economic growth was not easy at a time of worldwide economic slowdown .  He said China 's economy could maintain its great vitality because of the pull from stronger internal demand when external demand was low .  
Basing ourselves on the long period of socialist construction , we have practiced new policies of reform and opening to the outside world and formulated the basic theory , line and program of our party in the initial stage of socialism after summing up both the internal and external historical experience and through hard exploration .  
For the first time , it gives a systematical reply to a series of basic questions concerning the development course of socialism , development stage of socialism , fundamental tasks of socialism , development driving forces , external conditions , political guarantees , strategic steps , the party 's leadership , the reliable forces , and the motherland 's reunification in China . It guides our party to formulate its basic line in the initial stage of socialism .  
supported the national liberation movements in other countries ; and continuously expanded its external connections and relations .  This not only won extensive international sympathy and support for the Chinese revolution , but also made our contributions to the just struggle of all peoples for social progress and liberation throughout the world .  
The questions set in the polls of the " Ministry of Foreign Affairs " did point out that " the existing system and way of life will be retained . "  However , keeping in mind the fact that Taiwan is an island and its people are afraid of losing their freedom of external connections , they emphasized that " Taiwan will not have any diplomatic power from now on , " which was also intended as a threat .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
At present this extremely reactionary view of history has not yet formed into the main current in Japanese society , and although the sound of just condemnation in society of past external aggression is not as loud as it was 20 or 30 years ago , it can not be ignored .  
Indeed , by issuing the above circular , the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom Industries has made a major move to rectify order on China 's telecommunication market , and to prevent external forces , especially those in the radio , movie , and television sector , from making a roundabout entry into the market .  Given this , it seems that China 's program for " merging three networks " has an uncertain future .  
Nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable Renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system .  If the value of Japanese yen plummets and the US dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than Renminbi itself .  
We should no longer solidify the previous examination and approval system and the industrial policies of mercantilism , and the government should change its keynote of public policies to more open-minded industrial policies , which include steady and sound macroeconomic policies , transparent legal system , and better external public conditions and facilities .  
The " one country , two systems " formula is a new attempt unprecedented in human history .  However , Hong Kong people have succeeded .  Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
Nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable Renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system .  If the value of Japanese yen plummets and the US dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than Renminbi itself .

According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
Viewing from international experiences and lessons , there should be at least two prerequisites for opening the financial industry of a country : First , the external environment is stable and safe , and the financial industry will not be subject to frequent and tremendous impacts after it is opened to the outside world ;  
In close connection with the changes in the internal and external situation , with the reality of the latest development of China 's social productive forces and the profound changes in the economic system , with the demands of the masses for new development in material and cultural life , and with the new conditions and changes in the ranks of party members and cadres , we should ponder in depth how to adhere still better to the " three represents , " and make efforts to find answers from linking theory with reality .  
Part of that , 191.053 billion yuan , was used to repay the principal and interest of internal and external debts ; 179.16 billion yuan was spent reducing the deficit for the year ; and the remaining 1.29 billion yuan was used to replenish the central fiscal sinking fund .  
Economic experts here said that the good trend of national economic operation and the smooth progress in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises are the result of the implementation of both the CPC Central Committee and State Council measure to expand domestic demand and the pro-active fiscal policy .  Measures to crack down hard on smuggling and to encourage exports have provided a favorable external environment and market space for the turnaround of state enterprises .  
They require as the basis for their generation scientific theoretical understanding , and protracted influence by rich practical experience and environment , and they can certainly not be generated by simply relying on preaching or external coercion .  Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
Ye Zhen put it frankly : China 's present economic pickup is more of a product of policy and external factors , as the economic growth is still lacking in intrinsic vitality , the insufficiency of effective social demand has not yet been fundamentally alleviated , economic structural problems are conspicuous , consumer goods market exploitation is still " obstructed , " and the growth of peasants ' income is slowing down .  
Fifth , the province should take further steps to perfect its social security system and maintain social stability ; create a favorable external environment for a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ;  
The facts are , since assuming office on 1 July 1997 , Chief Executive Tung has led the SAR government in smoothly and effectively overcoming the assaults of a string of external factors as well as the political , social , economic , and people 's livelihood problems left over from the British Hong Kong Government era to win the central government 's great trust internally and international commendation externally .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
With respect to external policy , he made great efforts to push the so-called " pragmatic diplomacy " to expand Taiwan 's " international living space , " promote Taiwan 's accession to the United Nations and other international organizations in order to seek Taiwan 's " international legal subject " and its " independent international person " status in a vain attempt to create " two Chinas , " or " one China , one Taiwan " in the world .  
Also , according to public opinion , some people from the authorities should not indulge in " performances " and instead should put the Taiwan people 's well-being above everything else and publish feasible financial and economic policies and take measures to prevent the spread of disorderliness and outbreak of crises as soon as possible so as to create an internal and external environment favorable to the stock market 's recovery .  
Putin 's diplomatic maneuvering of the last several months shows that in his foreign policy , he has a long-term strategic goal as well as strong consideration of the reality .  His overall foreign policy goal is defined as " ensuring national security " and " developing a good external environment for economic growth " to revitalize Russia .  
Resolving only the issue of poverty in developing countries is far from enough .  It is essential to create a favorable external environment for developing countries , provide them with capital , technological , and manpower support , and help them eliminate the " digital gap , " so that all countries of the world can seek common development and prosperity in the process of economic globalization .  
In light of the new situation that has occurred in maintaining and developing a healthy and pure internal relationship in the military , they should strengthen the awareness of the cadres of " taking a correct attitude and commanding the troops in a civilized manner " and the awareness of military personnel regarding " respecting cadres and obeying management , " strengthen the unity between officers and men , and improve internal and external relationships .  
The Chinese Government will do its utmost to offer a fine external environment for the international exchange of qualified personnel , will meet international standards in accession of qualified personnel , market regulations , and intermediary services , and take the road suited to its national conditions and also conforming to general international standards .  
Given the demand of our national economic development and our commitments for WTO membership , our country is bound to open up more fields to the outside world , especially such service sectors as banking , insurance , telecommunications , foreign trade , commerce , tourism , and so on , step by step , and this is bound to create a favorable external environment for positively and effectively utilizing a growing amount of foreign capital . 
He said : China has consistently pursued the principle of non-interference in other countries ' internal affairs and respected the choice of the Yugoslav people .  China believes that the Yugoslav people are fully capable of solving their current problem free from external interference .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : " Closing coal pits and reducing production " and eliminating backward production capacity are aimed at creating external conditions for helping Datong Coal Mine end deficits and eliminate difficulties .  In addition , this is also an essential requirement for Shanxi Province to adjust economic structure , raise economic efficiency , and improve the ecological environment , and is an important link for successfully running state-owned key coal enterprises .  We must be determined to firmly grasp this work well .  
Wu Bangguo said : As a traditional industry , the coal industry has to shoulder a heavy historical burden .  In the current process , in which great changes have taken place in market supply and demand and the old economic system is being changed into the new , it is difficult for coal enterprises themselves to completely overcome difficulties they have encountered .  The government must make efforts to create an essential external environment and conditions in all aspects and give them specific support and assistance .  
On the other hand , aiming at the goal of ultimately becoming an extraordinarily large high-tech transnational group with fairly strong competitiveness , actively develop external economic relations and carry out business expansion on the international scene and export of technologies and labor service to make the contributions expected of us in enabling China 's aerospace [ industry ] to rank among the first in the world .  
In addition , Cambodia 's external activities also are active .  It already has joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ ASEAN ] , improved relations with the surrounding countries , and played an active role in regional and international affairs .  
At present , Chen Shui-bian and the fundamentalist faction of the DPP have already been surrounded by Taiwan 's political and economic crises , are exposed to attacks on all sides and are plagued with both internal and external troubles .  There is no other way out for them except abandoning the " Taiwan independence " program , transforming themselves , accepting the " one-China principle , " and correcting their incorrect line and policies .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
To resolve problems that currently exist in such aspects of our work as prison , reeducation through labor , lawyer , notarization , and basic-level of legal services ; and to eliminate the contradictions of irrational structures , imperfect mechanisms , and unsatisfactory coordination between internal and external relations , a fundamental way out is to carry out the reform , and to seek and boost the development through the reform .  We must establish a correct outlook on the reform and development ;  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
China , as a friendly neighbor of Cambodia , supports the Cambodian people 's endeavor in consolidating national reconciliation , safeguarding national sovereignty , and developing the economy .  China believes that , under the leadership of King Sihanouk , the Cambodian people certainly can successfully deal with all the internal and external challenges , surmount their difficulties , and build Cambodian into a country with happy people enjoying national harmony , political stability , and economic prosperity .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
The practice in the last two years showed that a major way to foster large enterprises with international competitive power is to select a batch of large-sized and super-sized enterprises for being listed in external capital markets after reorganization and restructuring .  
Deputy Li Rixu said : To deepen reforms in state-owned enterprises and really turn them into the main entities in the market competition , it is necessary to actively explore an effective form of managing the state-owned assets , deepen the three institutional reforms inside the enterprises , establish effective incentive and self-control mechanisms ; it is also necessary to more quickly advance various supportive reforms , thus creating a benign external environment for state-owned enterprises ' reform and development .  The work of separating the government from enterprises should be further advanced .  
The CPPCC organizations at all levels should continue to carry out the basic principle of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and the eight-point proposal set forth by President Jiang Zemin , actively promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel visits , strive to unite all internal and external forces that can be united , resolutely oppose any attempt to split the motherland , and make contributions to accomplishing the great cause of reunifying the motherland .  
The IMF Mission noted that the existing policy framework , including the linked exchange rate system , prudent fiscal policy , careful supervision of the financial sector and non-interventionist approach in factor markets , has proved to be effective and resilient in withstanding external pressures on the Hong Kong market .

This had strengthened the confidence of both Hong Kong people and the international community in the future of Hong Kong .  
We held an Environmental Awareness Seminar for our senior staff in the City Hall in October 1997 , enlisting assistance from external expert key speakers .  The purpose was to introduce to our staff the total concept of protecting the environment from global , regional , local and management perspectives .

" All the favourable conditions in Hong Kong which have underpinned our robust development in the past , such as our prudent financial policy , low taxation , sound financial and banking regulation , first-rate infrastructural facilities are still there and unaffected by external factors . " 
I am confident that , with our strong fundamentals , coupled with our flexibility of adaptation to external shock , and with the extent of price and cost adjustment that our free market economy has allowed us to go through up to now , our economy should be able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums , once the regional situation has settled , and our outlook beyond that remains bright . 
" Potential dangers may arise from dilapidated canopies or defective external renderings , dangerous or abandoned advertisement signs , unauthorised building works , defective or inadequate drains and water carrying services buried in or in the vicinity of slopes , " Dr Choi said .  
Mr Ng pointed out that a total of 27 bus routes were serving the new Airport , including seven airbus routes providing more direct and premium services to the Air Passenger Terminal ; eight external routes serving both the airport terminal and the Tung Chung new town ; four overnight routes as well as other shuttle services within Chek Lap Kok . A high-speed ferry service operating between Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Chek Lap Kok Ferry Pier was introduced to meet passenger demand .  
In short , our commitment to an open and free market and to the linked exchange rate system is paramount .  We will be vigilant in safeguarding them .  And we will make sure they will continue to work well to the benefit of the public and all local and overseas investors even when external economic conditions are turbulent .  It is our duty to the local community and to the stability of the regional markets .  
This report will be based on a review of all relevant and latest technical development , local as well as overseas , publications and standards on material deterioration , methods of inspection , investigation , testing , assessment and repair of buildings with particular consideration given to the three major areas of concern under BSIS , that is , integrity of external finishes , structural stability and fire safety .  
While we will exert ourselves in achieving this objective , I believe that we also need to take account , in my view , of four main factors which will be crucial to our recovery .  These are : an improvement in the external , financial and economic environment ; a steadying of our interest rates here ; stability in the property market ; and above all , a return of public confidence .  
The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .  
In this context , we attach particular importance to developing and releasing data on the external current and capital accounts , and to publishing more timely and detailed data on fiscal developments ( including the consolidated funds ) .

The practical and theoretical considerations involved in deciding on an appropriate exchange rate system can be reduced to four broad factors : the external versus domestic orientation of the economy ; the flexibility of its cost-price structure ; the exposure to financial shocks ; and the reputation and credibility of policy makers .  
The brief issued to prospective consultants requires the successful consultant to identify any shortcomings in the existing requirements , conduct a comparative study of international and other relevant national requirements , identify special local factors that should be taken into account in formulating the new requirements , consider the integration of the new requirements with building form so as to enhance and encourage energy efficiency and to reduce external environmental impact , and propose new standards and the appropriate means of control .

While the recovery was not yet broadly based , and much would depend on external developments , as well as the speed with which the remaining domestic price adjustment was completed and corporate profitability improved , Directors believed that the outlook for 2000 and beyond was generally positive .  
There is no doubt that economic recovery in the region has gathered considerable momentum .  Economic growth for most economies has been better than expected , external balances have improved remarkably , international funds have renewed interest in the region 's asset markets , and yield spreads of Asian sovereign bond issues over the US treasuries have narrowed notably .

The positive BoP position was mainly underpinned by the improvement in the current account , as Hong Kong 's exports strengthened while imports were restrained .  This reflected the adjustment process continuing in the economy to restore external balance after the Asian financial turmoil .  
Other major topics include : labour ; industry , distribution and services ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national accounts and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; medical and health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; and the environment .  
With the exercise of a wide range of measures to stimulate economic recovery , continuous economic growth on the mainland and the overall recovery of the Southeast Asian economies , Hong Kong recorded a GDP growth of 14.3% in the first quarter of this year .  The growth was mainly driven by external trade .  Further growth has been recorded in investment and consumption .  The sign of economic recovery is now evident .  
These included the release of the first set of quarterly Gross National Product statistics for the first quarter of 1999 in December 1999 and the release of the first complete set of external direct investment statistics for 1998 in March 2000 , encompassing both the stock and flow of inward and outward direct investments .

Compared with the first quarter of 1999 , the current account surplus in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit , a sustained improvement in invisible trade surplus , a continued net inflow of external factor income , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
They involve schemes making use of various tax planning tools , such as trusts , alienation of interest income , and artificial public issues of debentures in overseas stock exchanges , for the purpose of engineering artificial interest payment situations through circular flows of funds within companies in a group without any genuine external borrowing which requires real interest expenses , " the spokesman explained . 
Since the country went ahead with reform and open door policy in 1978 , Hong Kong businesses have been actively involved in investment and trade in the coastal provinces , developing external trade in tandem with local enterprises .  Plenty of valuable experience has thus been gained which can be used for reference in the development of western region . " he added .  
Hong Kong 's market mechanism is well aligned with the world system .  The regulation of financial businesses such as banking , insurance and securities is efficient .  Professional services such as legal services , accounting and consultancy are well established .  The external networking such as trade , communication and transportation is also properly set up .  
For instance , with the prosperous development of local industries in 1960s and 1970s , domestic exports of " electronic products " , " watches and clocks " , " plastic products " and " toys and dolls " , which were the major manufacturing industries in Hong Kong at that time , occupied a prominent position in the external trade of Hong Kong .  
( g ) joint exercises with other departments be conducted to improve inter-departmental co-ordination and communication , a mobile communication system external to the local institution 's Control Room be introduced to enhance communication in emergency situation , sea transport especially during emergencies be outsourced to improve the response time in the mobilization of the CSD Emergency Support Group , and the operational manual on handling of major incidents be further reviewed and refined as appropriate .  
A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "  
JCRA 's upgrade was based on Hong Kong 's recovery from the economic recession , the extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position that were not impaired by the financial crisis , and the reforms that had strengthened the currency board arrangements and enhanced the Government 's ability to fend off speculative pressure .  
Six categories of S &amp; amp ; T statistics , which followed closely the recommendation of the OECD and with particular reference to the specific circumstances in Hong Kong , would be compiled .  They were statistics on ( i ) research and development inputs ; ( ii ) S &amp; amp ; T human resources ; ( iii ) patents ; ( iv ) external technology flows ; ( v ) S &amp; amp ; T publications ; ad ( vi ) technological innovation .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the second quarter of 2000 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit and a continued net outflow of current transfers , yet more than offset by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus and a substantial growth in net inflow of external factor income .  
While the current account continued to record a large surplus upon the export boom and the net inflow of external factor income , the financial non-reserve assets also switched back to a net inflow in the second quarter , mostly due to a substantial inflow of direct investment into Hong Kong but also upon a continued net inflow of portfolio investment fund .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the third quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by a substantial rise in invisible trade surplus .  
A Government secretariat spokesman pointed out that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the third quarter of 2000 , marked by a further increase in the current account surplus and continued net inflow of financial non-reserve assets .  
And as Hong Kong is seeing increased heart attacks , I will consider advising the Force to follow its United States counterparts by procuring automated external defibrillators so instant treatment can be applied , " he said .  " At the scene of major disasters , it is vital to have sound co-ordination of first-aid initiatives and I think officers , apart from discharging their own duties , also have a role to play . "  
For the purpose of comparison , the paper focused in particular on the recent financial crisis in Argentina , which , like Hong Kong , operated a currency board system .  The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
BL 48 gives a detailed account of the manifold functions of the CE . He is responsible for leading the government of the Region , signing bills and promulgating laws , signing budgets and issuing executive orders .  He has the power to appoint and remove judges , and report to the CPG for appointment and removal of principal officials .  He can pardon persons convicted of criminal offences or commute their penalties , and on behalf of the HKSAR , conduct external affairs as authorized by the CPG .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by an increase in invisible trade surplus .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's external payments position remained favourable in the fourth quarter of 2000 , characterised by a continued surplus in the current account and a further net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , hence yielding an overall balance of payments surplus .  
This was underpinned by both a further distinct surplus in the current account and a significant net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , amidst the strong performance of Hong Kong 's external trade and the relative robustness of Hong Kong 's stock market in that year .  
Mr Tsang cautioned that any minor cracking , spalling or bulging of cement rendering ; damage to the concrete wall surface , wall tiles or other finishes on external parts of buildings should be repaired promptly to prevent the defective and loose parts from falling onto the streets .  
It has also made developing countries more vulnerable to the impact of external economic turmoil and financial crises , as evidenced by the grave impact of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s on some Asian countries and regions . 
The spokesman cautioned that any minor cracking , damage or spalling or bulging of cement rendering , concrete surface , loose plasters , wall and delaminated mosaic tiles or other finishes on external and internal walls should be removed or repaired promptly to prevent the defective and loose parts from falling onto the streets .  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 19 areas , including population ; labour ; industry and commerce ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national accounts and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; medical and health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; and the environment .

A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the first quarter of 2001 , marked by both a continued surplus in the current account and a further considerable net inflow of financial non-reserve assets in the capital and financial account .  
Trading activity was weak in the first quarter , dampened by concern over deterioration in the external economic environment , sharp correction in the local stock market , and an ample supply of new flats coming on stream .  
Mr Leung said : " The global financial system remains under stress , given large external deficit of the US , extended deflation and weak banking system in Japan , significant correction in major equity markets , more volatility and misalignments in exchange rates , and problems in key emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey . "  
Some 3 000 overseas companies have established their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong . Two years ago we attracted the second highest amount of external direct investment in Asia , just behind the Mainland and far exceeding other places in Asia . That figure increased more than 1.5 times last year .  China 's accession to the World Trade Organisation is expected to add impetus to this momentum .  
( a ) The Linked Exchange Rate provides a stable , predictable and well understood monetary system that is well suited to Hong Kong 's highly external and flexible economy and to its position as an international financial centre .  
Despite the deterioration of the external environment which has clouded Hong Kong 's economic outlook , general insurance business continued to grow with gross premiums increasing by 11.8% to $ 15.0 billion for the first three quarters of 2001 , compared with the corresponding period for the previous year .  The first three-quarter underwriting results also improved with a modest profit of $ 109 million .  
On this comparison , the current account surplus in the third quarter of 2001 was characterised by an increase in visible trade deficit , an increase in invisible trade surplus , a marked rise in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Compared with the same quarter in 2000 , the current account surplus in the fourth quarter of 2001 was characterised by a marked decrease in visible trade deficit , a small increase in invisible trade surplus , a substantial increase in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the surplus in the current account rose markedly further in the fourth quarter of 2001 , underpinned by a surge in the combined visible and invisible trade surplus , as well as continued net external factor income inflow .  
At a time when Asian economies are showing incipient signs of recovery against an improved external environment , international capital flows are triggering back to the region but in a more cautious and discriminate manner than before .  Investors are now a lot more selective about who may lend to and where they put their money .  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 20 areas , including population ; labour ; commerce and industry ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national income and Balance of Payments statistics ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; environment ; and topical studies .  
" When TKE is opened later this year , it will more than double the capacity of the external public transport services for Tseung Kwan O . It will offer convenient , fast , frequent and reliable services to TKO residents , about 80 per cent of whom will be within walking distance to the railway stations . 
Compared with the same quarter in 2001 , the current account surplus in the first quarter of 2002 was characterised by a marked decrease in visible trade deficit , an increase in invisible trade surplus , a rise in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers .  
Moreover , the current account continued to attain a sizeable surplus in the first quarter , underpinned by a marked rise in trade surplus , as well as sustained net external factor income inflow upon notable investment income from the Mainland .  
In addition , the Pharmacy and Poisons Board proposes to relax the control of Clobetasone butyrate when contained in preparations intended for external application only at not more than 0.05% so that its sale does not require the support of a prescription but still has to be sold by authorised sellers of poisons under the direct supervision of registered pharmacists .  
Extra convenience will be provided for public housing tenants living in Harmony Blocks as the Housing Department allows an additional location for the installation of laundry racks .  Starting from August 15 , tenants may apply to erect a drying rack , at their own expenses , at a designated position to the external wall outside the living room .  They have a choice of a single or double stainless steel rods or nylon ropes .  
" We note JCRA 's recognition that Hong Kong enjoys strong external position , high level of fiscal flexibility , a resilient financial sector and a high level of autonomy in many aspects , including the financial and legal systems , and that HK 's role as an international financial centre has remained intact , " a Government spokesman said .  
( a ) For public rental housing , as at September 2002 , there are 10 324 families with a living area of less then 5.5 square metres Internal Floor Area ( Internal Floor Area ( IFA ) is the total area inside the flat measured to the internal face of external and / or party walls , i.e . common walls between two flats ) ( IFA ) per person , constituting 1.7 per cent of the total number of public rental households .  
On statistical developments , Mr Leung learned that systems to provide constant price quarterly GDP statistics by economic activity and data on international investment position and external debt had been successfully launched in 2002 , while new projects in the pipeline included the further development of statistics on science and technology and collation of data pertaining to the economic relationship between Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta .  
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
Along with continuing structural change in Hong Kong 's mode of trade , Hong Kong , apart from being engaged in traditional external trade , is also engaged in other forms of trading called " offshore trade " where the goods involved do not cross Hong Kong 's customs boundary .  
The publication covers statistical programmes in 20 areas , including population ; labour ; commerce and industry ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national income and Balance of Payments ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; food and environmental hygiene ; leisure and cultural services ; water supplies ; the environment ; and topical studies .

Members noted the publication on June 27 of the letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority , dated June 25 2003 , formally specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong : this was defined in the letter as continuing to be a stable external exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong , in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar , at around HK $ 7.80 to US $ 1 , maintained through a currency board system .  
This was largely due to a markedly reduced current account surplus , as the spread of SARS in the second quarter resulted in a distinct setback in inbound tourism and related service exports , and hence a shrinkage in invisible trade surplus , and as net external factor income inflow also contracted considerably .  
Under the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion , sections one through four of article twelve , permission will not be granted to those who : A . participate in the communist party or other rebellious organization or their activities ; B . participate in violent or terrorist organizations or their activities ; C . are suspected of involvement in important activities of internal disruption or external attacks ; D . outside the Taiwan area have been involved in serious crimes or who are habitual criminals .  
Looking at it from the point of view of the domestic and external economic situations , the outlook is not very rosy . Because just now the world economy is performing poorly , market expansion is extremely tough . At the same time there is inflationary pressure in Taiwan , so that the government can not devalue the NT dollar to enhance export competitiveness , nor can it adopt a loose money supply policy to free up capital for enterprises .  
Firstly , the Yin &amp; Yang principles described in the I-ching ( Classic of Changes ) can indicate many polarities such as the sun &amp; moon , day &amp; night , light &amp; dark , motion &amp; rest , internal &amp; external , cold &amp; heat , hard &amp; soft , and male &amp; female .  
After all , perhaps , lay people 's belief in Buddhism and Buddhist worship may stem from a worldly viewpoint of bringing them tangible success . They seek support from the bodhisattvas ' spiritual power to guard them against evil , but they fail to cultivate inner awareness or attain the inner tranquility and joy that come from dispelling selfish attachments and external concerns about fortune or misfortune . In contrast to Manjusri with his metaphysical ideas of prajna wisdom , Samantabhadra and his message of " great action " exemplifies a much more concrete aspect of Buddhism .  
Classical neo - - Mannerist architecture favors round pillars and gables , and the external walls are mostly decorated with white false stone ; it is relatively stately . Non-classical neo-Mannerist architecture includes Byzantine-style or the North European traditional brick construction ; the outside is relatively complex , luxurious , and free-wheeling .  
At present , the ROC 's total external trade is fifteenth largest in the world ; GNP is ranked 25th in the world , even exceeding Luxembourg , an OECD member ; twenty continuous years of trade surpluses have accumulated one of two largest - - if not the largest - - foreign exchange reserves in the world ; foreign investment in Southeast Asia is second only to Japan .  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
Sometimes I separate my use of black-and - white and color photographs : For external things , such as traditional street festivals , I use color , while I use black-and-white to express the unseen , what is hidden .  
And they ca n't refuse these evenings out but must attend to them like their regular duties in the office . " At the same time as paying close attention to the course of the conversation between the two main parties , they also force themselves to try to be witty and interesting , so as to make the scene more festive , " says Li Tao , director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , speaking from personal experience .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
He says that in South Africa there is a scientist who has studied black eagles for more than twenty years . The male and female black eagle are completely identical in their external physical features , but through many years of observation , she became able to distinguish the male and female of a pair of black eagles flying together , from their attitude and position .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
We discovered that China in the Year 1 was in the Han dynasty , which established the foundations of Chinese systems in many areas . It was an era also of dynastic struggles , filled with heroes and striking personalities . At the Year 1000 , the Song dynasty had reunified China . Its weakness forced it into a form of " economic diplomacy " to fend off the peoples of the north , yet at the same time this demilitarization of external relations led to splendorous achievements in culture and wealth for society as a whole .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs . Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men . A case in point : Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look . They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
Buddhism and Taoism seemed less useful than Confucianism in resolving worldly problems . Confucianism thus entered a period of creative transformation in order to meet external challenges to the state . Zhu Xi 's influence proved greater than that of other philosophers because of his work integrating various schools of thought , doing textual research , and annotating the classics . For example , prior to the Song dynasty , The Great Learning was not a very influential work in China .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
China has successfully withstood external political pressure and has scored rapid economic development , he said , adding that it has a traditional friendship with other developing countries and supports them in their demand for a just and equitable international economic order , and is providing assistance in funds and technology to them  
On the external debt issue , she said as many developing countries are still faced with the difficulties caused by heavy external debt burdens , it is imperative that further measures aimed at a comprehensive , effective and durable solution of the problem should be explored  
during the past five years , the chinese government has unswervingly pursued an independent foreign policy of peace , li said in his report on government work this not only has helped create an external environment favorable to china 's reform , opening up and modernization , but also contributed to world peace and common development  
With minimal encouragement from external sources , Somalia 's formal and informal private sector in all regions long ago began the task of breathing life into commercial and trading activities .  
Past mediation efforts have been shown to be insufficient because they were limited by a mandate lacking firmness , but also rendered more difficult by the diverse political interests of individual external forces .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
In this case , pressure from the international community , including its global and regional political bodies , and the persistent efforts of certain internal and external groups led to a series of negotiations without precedent .  
Despite earnest efforts to carry out structural adjustments in their national economic policies , most African countries have found little reprieve from the unfavourable external economic environment , harsh climatic conditions , civil war and strife .  
" Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The representative of FICSA expressed concern at the rapid change in the New York / Washington costofliving differential and hoped that it did not indicate inherent instability in the model chosen , but represented its sensitivity to real external factors .  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,

Although a larger flow of external funding and assistance to human settlements development is a desirable outcome , sustainability can only be achieved in the medium and long term by using scarce external resources in a strategic and catalytic way .  
Partnerships that link the public and private sectors ; external , national and local institutions ; and public organizations with nongovernmental organizations and community groups are essential for sustainable human settlement development .  
This programme is based on joint endeavours initiated by UNDP but led by participating countries and with a substantive participation of external partners , including bilateral donors and international and regional institutions and organizations .  
The continuing lack of accelerated growth in the regional economy is a vivid reminder that the underlying structural constraints and extreme vulnerabilities to external shocks that provoked the African crises in the first place are still very much with us .  
The difficult socioeconomic conditions , exacerbated by deteriorating and fluctuating terms of trade , external indebtedness and political instability , which induce internal , regional and international migrations ;  
During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
As all who had emerged from long periods of colonial rule were well aware , factors both internal and external could reduce independence to a mere legal formality unless it had solid economic foundations .  
The total stock of external debt in the least developed countries represented nearly three quarters of their combined gross domestic product .  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
In addition to the external disputes of international organizations , relatively important internal disputes could also arise which did not lend themselves to settlement by reference to the model established by national constitutional or administrative norms .  
The internal difficulties experienced by Yemen during the course of the year had been exploited by external forces with the objective of impeding the development of a free , democratic and prosperous society in Yemen .  
Develop economic policies to mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
It was essential that the international community should recognize the decisive role it had to play in the creation of a favourable external economic environment and improving market access for products from the developing countries .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , and considering that such assistance should be expanded further , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance ,  
Along with reform in all aspects of social life , Viet Nam has consistently pursued its foreign policy of broad openness , the thrust of which is to diversify and multilateralize its external relations in order to create a stable environment and external conditions conducive to the task of building and defending the country , and to enhance Viet Nam 's position on the international scene .  
There is a need , as a matter of priority that should be addressed with courage and creativity , to reformulate policies and solutions to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries that would help create a climate of equal opportunity amongst peoples and nations and make use of the latent potential of many parts of the world in paving the way towards balanced and comprehensive development at the threshold of the twenty-first century .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
Because the sanctions regime , in practical terms , upsets the normal and balanced functioning of the economy of whole adjoining regions , undermining their entire economic infrastructure and rupturing external economic links , we need a mechanism for the careful consideration , before any decision is taken on imposing sanctions against any country , of the potential consequences of such a step both for the country targeted by the sanctions and for third countries .  
It should be remembered that this progress has been made in an internal and external economic context that has been generally unfavourable , because of the continuing constraints that are impeding any process of stable and sustained development .  
It has been said , but can not be repeated enough and no school of thought , no economic-development specialist can contradict me that the development process in Africa will come to a standstill if the efforts of the African States continue to be bogged down by the burden of external debt , if flows of capital continue to be insufficient , if the obstacles limiting market access persist , if commodities are not diversified or changed and if the terms of trade remain depressed .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
The difficulties besetting African countries are still present : the crushing burden of external debt , the steady deterioration of the terms of trade , the scant inflow of resources and direct foreign investment and the continued degradation of the environment because of the growing , interrelated pressures of the population and poverty .  
Given much-needed support to the developing countries as they reactivate their economies and creating a favourable external environment for them are not only important conditions for the shared economic growth and common prosperity of all countries , but also a crucial guarantee for lasting peace and stability throughout the world .  
The African Group believes that the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda will provide to Africa and the international community an opportunity to conduct an in-depth assessment of the actions so far taken to implement the New Agenda and the measures needed for sustained economic growth and sustainable development beyond the 1990s , as well as to set out new and corrective policies and measures for strengthened external support .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
The programme covered areas where the secretariat had established operational capacities and addressed such specific areas as export diversification and trade development , customs and trade facilitation , trade statistics , debt management , external financial flows and investments , domestic financial markets , insurance and transport , as well as the regulatory framework affecting those areas and the business environment in general .  
Develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
It holds promise for increasing the yield , quality , efficient processing and utilization of products ; for decreasing reliance on agro-chemicals and other external inputs ; and for improving the conservation and use of genetic and other natural resources .  
Although NATCAP began without a coherent strategy and with a heavy reliance on external inputs , the current generation of NATCAP countries have evolved to a point where there is substantial national content with increased reliance on in-country task forces .  
Recognizing that the mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action is of particular significance as it will provide an opportunity to the international community to set out new and corrective policies and measures , including strengthened external support to the least developed countries in all areas , to support their efforts so as to ensure the timely , effective and full implementation of the Programme of Action during the remainder of the decade ,  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
At consultations held in 1994 at Bellagio , Italy , and Coppet , Switzerland , on the theme " Refocusing UNEP " , it was concluded that UNEP should reorient its current programme , emphasize strategic and intellectual leadership rather than operational activities and develop the substantive and managerial capacity to catalyse external resources effectively .  
The situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is marked by a complex network of external and internal factors that contribute to economic and political uncertainty and rising social tension .  
In 1993 , the total stock of external debt ( measured at current prices and exchange rates ) rose by 5 per cent - much less than gross domestic product ( GDP ) - to $ 1,630-billion , with much of this attributable to growth of debt stocks in Asia as well as to valuation effects .  
In part this is because of the role of external forces ( e.g . , economic growth and interest rates in the OECD area ) in " diverting " funds from OECD economies to the emerging markets and also because other influences are of a transient or finite nature ( e.g . , resulting from privatizations and returning flight capital ) .  
Positive and negative developments in the external and national policy environments as well as successful and unsuccessful macroeconomic and microeconomic policies are reflected in the amount of resources available for the financing of cross-sectoral issues and sectoral finance .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , and considering that such assistance should be expanded further , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance ,  
Among the problems the subprogramme will address are those related to improving international purchasing and supply management methods and practices , inappropriate procurement procedures and organizational structures , insufficient external and internal information for import planning and supply management , lack of skilled personnel and limited availability of import support services .  
At its twenty-fifth session , held in April 1994 , the Commission approved the present programme of work , paying special attention to the situation of the economies of the region , which have been characterized by expansion of economic activity with relative price stability , vast inflows of external capital and some relief from the debt burden .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
The estimated requirements of $ 19,700 , reflecting negative growth of $ 31,500 , relate to the following expenditures : ( a ) public information production : reduced requirements of $ 10,600 would cover the cost of engaging external marketing research organizations and other related contractual services with a view to ensuring that the Department 's outputs are responsive to targeted audiences and their identified needs ; and ( b ) subscription to news agency services ( $ 9,100 ) . 
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The provision ( $ 259,700 ) reflects a negative growth of $ 339,600 and would provide for the external printing costs of the Yearbook of the International Law Commission ( $ 27,700 ) ; and honoraria of the Chairman and 32 members of the Commission , one member being excluded from accepting the payment by national legislation , and additional amounts payable to 6 special rapporteurs , at the rates set by the General Assembly in its resolution 35 / 218 of 17 December 1980 ( $ 232,000 ) . 
Adjustments in this direction have involved increasing popular participation , promoting peaceful inter-State relations and enhancing regional security and stability , increasing the participation of enterprises and cooperation among them and their associations , expanding cooperation with major external partners , including in some instances through the formation of preferential trading agreements , and restructuring the policy organs and executive secretariats of groupings .  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
Such crises may save various sources , continue for varying periods of time , and disrupt governmental performance to varying degrees , but their primary characteristic is that the existing national Government is unable to meet the immediate daily requirements of its population or to build a viable basis for sustainable development without external assistance .  
Countries may experience disruption of their governmental systems from at least three major sources : massive natural disasters , such as earthquakes , cyclones , or volcanic eruptions ; internal civil strife ; or external conflict / war with neighbouring States .  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .  
The uncertain global economic climate has been accompanied by economic restructuring as well as , in a certain number of countries , persistent , unmanageable levels of external debt and structural adjustment programmes . "  Fifth sentence .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , i.e . of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In addition , the Commission requested the Executive Secretary of ECA and the Director-General of UNIDO to hold consultative meetings of sponsoring countries and organizations with indigenous and external potential investors as well as African and non-African financial institutions , for the purpose of identifying , formulating and undertaking feasibility studies and financing of specific bankable projects with basic industries .  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , that is , of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Reaffirming its resolution 48 / 165 of 21 December 1993 on the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership and 48 / 166 of 21 December 1993 on an agenda for development , Reaffirming also the urgent need for a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is required to contribute to a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also with concern the urgent need to fully address the problem of the combined external debt stock of developing countries , bearing in mind the special and critical situation of the most indebted developing countries in Africa and the least developed countries ,  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Recognizes that a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries will have a substantial impact on sustaining the strength of the global economy and will greatly contribute to efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Factors such as a strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates and have helped these countries to address some of the constraints facing their economies .  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt servicing-problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , the Prime Minister of Fiji had stressed the importance of working to redress some of the wrongs that history had wrought upon indigenous peoples and guaranteeing that external values and forces did not continue to impose political concessions , economic reforms and social changes that were not desired by indigenous people themselves .  
International Law Fellowship Programme had made a worthwhile contribution to the programme for the current biennium ; it would be desirable for the Hague Academy of International Law to have additional funds , from voluntary contributions , so that its very successful external courses could be offered more frequently and extended to more geographical areas .  
the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,

it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
The macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programmes of a wide range of least developed countries had not been successful during the first half of the current decade owing to an overall unfavourable external environment .  
The baseless accusations that have been made , including the alleged capturing of Yemeni fishermen by the Eritrean Government ; that Eritrea is being used by external forces ; and other similar inflammatory and irresponsible statements will only derail the issue into a perilous path , rendering a timely solution elusive .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
A number of societies are seriously threatened by increasing external debt , the instability of the international financial system , persistent unemployment , intractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of crime and corruption .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
The commitment that we undertook at the 1990 World Summit therefore represented a challenge that we had to accept in extremely difficult circumstances , since we entered the decade in the midst of a deep economic crisis with reduced resources , an oppressive external debt and great demands and needs for social services .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
As a country that has suffered under the heavy burden of external debt and the ensuing social and economic hardships resulting from structural adjustment , Jamaica is fully aware of the difficulties currently being confronted by our sister nations on the African continent .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
The overwhelming burden of external debt , excessive dependence on a few commodities , rapid population growth , serious deterioration of nutritional indicators , environmental degradation with the recurring problems of drought and desertification social tensions and ongoing conflicts reveal only part of the grave consequences of increasing marginalization of African countries from the world economy .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
At the two previous sessions of the General Assembly , we pointed out that the lack of visible signs of understanding and tangible measures on the part of the developed nations in assisting the new and restored democracies could be interpreted as an unfavourable external factor and have serious consequences for both national harmony and regional stability .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
In both Declarations , the international community recognized that no State has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other State , and that no State may use or encourage the use of economic , political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights or to secure from it advantages of any kind .  
Today , at a time when the reform of the system is the subject of such intense discussion , our national experience may perhaps be useful , as it is an example of cooperation that is at once respectful and dynamic , based fundamentally on internal efforts with appropriate external help .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action 1 / and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
" Run out " ( out-of-true-running ) : radial displacement in one revolution of the main spindle measured in a plane perpendicular to the spindle axis at a point on the external or internal revolving surface to be tested ( reference : " ISO " 230 Part 1-1986 , para .  NULL  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
On the one hand , Argentina , Mexico and , to some extent , Uruguay had to manage their economic policies in a climate marked by a sharp contraction of external financing , in which they faced severe slumps in domestic demand , with adverse effects on output and fiscal revenues .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
Economic reform and structural adjustment programmes designed to correct internal and external imbalances as well as to enhance efficiency and productivity , which are particularly essential in a rapidly globalizing world economy , continued to be implemented in most countries in the ESCWA region in 1995 . 
A second objective will be to increase awareness of the changing nature , volume and direction of international financial flows , propose ways and means to enhance and stabilize both official and private finance , monitor changes in the external debt situation and identify innovative approaches and strategies to resolve the difficulties of countries with debt-servicing problems ;  
To increase Governments ' understanding of the main internal and external problems and obstacles impeding the development of foreign trade and foreign direct investments in the ECE region and the implications for these areas of implementing the Uruguay Round decisions by the beginning of the twenty-first century with a view to contributing to the adoption of policies facilitating and promoting intraregional trade and investment cooperation ;  
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
The meeting invited interested developing countries and donor Governments and multilateral organizations to review policy frameworks , plans of action and basic social services programmes , with identified national and external financing requirements , in all appropriate forums , in particular consultative group and round-table meetings .  
The Executive Board also decided that the allocation of resources should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the actual needs and requirements of countries , and should take fully into consideration coherent national programmes , plans and strategies on population and development and the need for external resources to complement national financial efforts in the area of population and development ; and endorsed the procedure for categorization of countries into three groups as outlined in the report and approved the relative shares of resources among them .  
Economic development and cooperation , documents were issued on the annual survey of economic and social developments in the ESCWA region , 1994 ; stock markets in the ESCWA region ; developments and issues in the external trade and payments situation of countries of Western Asia ; developments and trends in the monetary and financial sectors ; revitalization of research and development activities in selected countries of the ESCWA region ; and techno-economic aspects of the application of new materials in the ESCWA region .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .  
UNDP has defined the conditions for success to include : objectives established and communicated ; internal and external risks identified and assessed ; policies established , communicated and practised ; and measurable performance targets and indicators included in objectives and plans .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
The preparation of such a diagnostic framework would enable each country to undertake its own analysis of the conditions specific to it ; it would allow a wide range of national factors to be taken into account , particularly the interaction of different sectoral policies , and a nation 's international obligations ; and it would draw attention , where appropriate , to those circumstances in which global or external influences were important as driving forces of change . 
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
Hope was expressed that a solution will be found as the World Bank and IMF continue their joint and ongoing efforts to bring the external debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries , including multilateral debt , to a sustainable level .  
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
International strategies of cooperation and coordination are outlined in the Habitat Agenda , chapter IV , section E . The main strategic objectives and activities presented in that section cover the establishment of an international enabling environment ; issues of international finance , external debt and trade ; the promotion of the transfer of technology and exchange of information ; and the provision of support to technical and institutional cooperation .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
Funding of humanitarian projects ; ( ii ) capacity-building ; ( iii ) internal and external training programmes ; ( iv ) creation of a conducive atmosphere for cooperation with international NGOs and United Nations agencies .  
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
Requests the Executive Director to arrange an overall independent and external evaluation of the global contraceptive commodity programme at a time to be decided by the Executive Board , particularly with regard to its impact on national capacity-building in order to provide the Board with the information required to make a decision on whether the programme should be continued or ended .  
On that occasion the General Assembly responded to drastic changes that are rapidly transforming the role and scope of government in the economy and society : the globalization of the economy , democratization , environmental pressures , corruption , national fiscal and external deficits , pressures for social justice , the information revolution and the emergence of civil society as an alternative supplier of a range of public services .  
Given that Mozambique takes off from an extremely low economic base and after factoring in population increases , the prevalence of the recent trend of lacklustre growth performance would translate into GDP per capita increases too modest to make a visible contribution to , and to sustain , the goals of poverty reduction , social sector development , reconstruction and restoration of external viability .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
Lastly , the pay-offs through greater mutual understanding and confidence gained in subregional economic cooperation and factor mobility may be intangible , but they generate substantial positive , highly visible and collective external benefits for ED , networking and integration among the collaborating or participating countries in the long run .  
The task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled " Macroeconomic policy questions " ;  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
In the context of ending 35 years of armed conflict , it emphasizes in particular the need to overhaul the security functions of the State : under a reformed Constitution , the police are to be restructured , strengthened and consolidated in a new National Civil Police , which will assume responsibility for internal security ; intelligence gathering activities are to be reorganized and regulated ; and the army will limit its role to external defence and will adjust its doctrine , training , deployment , size and budget accordingly .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
In accordance with United Nations Administrative Tribunal jurisprudence , the consolidated measures set out in administrative instruction ST / AI / 412 specified that a woman candidate , whether internal or external , should be given preference only when her qualifications met all the requirements for the vacant post and when her qualifications were substantially equal or superior to those of competing male candidates ( para .  NULL  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
" Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;

At the end of the first preambular paragraph , the words " other relevant international agreements concerning international cooperation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries " were replaced with the words " the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summit meetings held since the beginning of the 1990s " ;  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
The main objectives of the Andean Community are to promote the balanced and harmonious development of the member countries on an equal basis through integration and economic and social cooperation ; to accelerate economic and social growth and generate employment ; to reduce vulnerability to external factors and to improve the position of member countries in the global economic context ; and to strengthen subregional solidarity and reduce differences in existing levels of development among its members .  
With the successful conclusion of the military observer Mission in Guatemala , the definitive ceasefire between the Government and the URNG has established the necessary conditions for the promotion of peace and development in a subregion of the Americas which has been particularly vulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and external interference .  
Unfortunately , in our world there remain conflicts , violence , ethnic strife , religious intolerance , terrorism , drug trafficking , corruption , poverty , unjust international economic relations and a heavy external debt that continues to prove overwhelming .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
It is recognized , however , that the responsibility for coordinating external assistance , from multilateral , bilateral or other international organizations , rests first and foremost with the Government concerned .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
The development of future large water-supply systems must adopt pricing that reflects all external costs , including waterlogging ; salinization ; habitat alteration ; impact on endangered species ; long-term deterioration of water quality due to changing land-use practices in catchment areas ; cultural and social dislocation ; and the cost of imposed risks .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers .  
As they moved along the path of reform , their objectives became more complex and ambitious , shifting from the limited concerns of macroeconomic imbalances and stabilization to the promotion of development by a plethora of market-oriented reforms , including the improvement of economic efficiency , curbing of public sector intervention , encouragement of the private sector and liberalization of the external trade sector .  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
The granting of preferential access to external markets , through bilateral , regional and international agreements , would greatly enhance the investment promotion efforts of developing countries , particularly smaller economies , as a minimum market size is an important prerequisite for many investors .  
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
We undertake to continue to coordinate our positions on these issues in regional and international forums and to contribute to the work of the United Nations Decade of International Law with the goal of intensifying the analysis of the question of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national laws , strengthening multilateralism through the application of the international agreements signed by States and guiding the external conduct of our countries on the basis of international law .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance , which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed , inter alia , to increase export earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
However , even with sufficient resources , the initiative 's main goal of reaching external debt sustainability would be unattainable unless a favourable international economic climate were created to provide open access to markets , modern technologies and sources of development financing .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
The annex makes reference to the identification by the Panel of numerous practical disadvantages to independent audits and management reviews by individual Member States and to the fact that the Financial Regulations of the United Nations stipulate that the external auditors appointed by the organizations ' governing bodies are solely responsible for the conduct of audits .  
These are aggravated by , inter alia : stifling external indebtedness ; a continued deterioration of the terms of trade ; an alarming decline in official development assistance ; and an equally worrying reduction of international cooperation for development in general .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
On the one hand and thanks to the praiseworthy support of the Organization of African Unity , the League of Arab States , the French Republic and the assistance of the international community its goal was to lay the foundations for the reconstruction of a country that has for so long been buffeted by numerous acts of external aggression that have engendered enormous economic and financial difficulties that have significantly hampered its development . 
There is a need for better designed projects at the national level , with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and economic performance , together with policies aimed at creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment ( internal and external ) and donor support .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
The problem remained unsolved until external factors triggered spiralling resentment that was exploited by the elements concerned : the arrival of the Rwandan refugees in 1994 and its consequences , namely , imported violence , the international protection extended even to those guilty of genocide , environmental damage and the preferential treatment of refugees fed latent anti-Rwandan feelings . 
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
The Russian cosmonauts performed five space walks , during which they succeeded in mounting a new telescopic loading boom on the external surface of the station , together with supplementary scientific instrumentation , and also transferred fresh a solar array , fitted with United States photoelectric elements , from the docking unit to the Kvant astrophysics module .  
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas . 
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .  
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
The remark was made that the task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
Constraints to external communication and public affairs identified through the change management exercise were : ( a ) unclear policy messages in written and oral communications , which are frequently jargon-ridden and lacking in hard facts ; ( b ) uneven collaboration between DPA and line units ; ( c ) a media-shy culture in UNDP as a whole ; and ( d ) insufficient financial investment in communication .  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
While the mobilization of external resources should target and tap into the growing non-debt-creating arrangements and particularly direct foreign investment ( FDI ) , the domestic counterpart should seek to exploit the rich potential within both the urban and rural milieus .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
Moreover , the major donors stated in 1995 that the role of external partners is to help strengthen capacities in developing partner countries , and that the dominant conception of the mission of development assistance is to help countries and societies to strengthen their economic , human , social and institutional capacities for self-sustaining development .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers . on service providers . 
This exercise involved extensive external and internal consultations throughout 1994 and 1995 and culminated in the introduction in January 1996 of a modified organizational structure consisting essentially of redefined divisional responsibilities and the creation of a Corporate Strategy and Quality Assurance Section to facilitate a corporate approach to the delivery of services .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
Without an effort of that scope and significance , and without a solution to such fundamental problems as the external debt of the African countries , the vast majority of those countries would be unable to overcome the difficulties arising from their current critical economic situation and the accumulation of serious social problems caused by marginalization .  
With regard to the external debt , the initiatives taken by the Bretton Woods institutions and creditor countries to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and to find solutions to multilateral debt were insufficient and of limited scope , and the situation of middle-income countries which met their obligations promptly and in full was likewise unresolved ; hence a comprehensive and radical solution to the debt problem must be found .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  7A . 8 During the biennium the following activities will be undertaken :  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries . 
Although Nicaragua had been able to make progress in solving the problem of the external debt , through the cooperation of the international community and friendly countries , such as the Russian Federation , which had recently announced the cancellation of the debt balance , the external debt was still a very heavy burden which impeded economic growth and inhibited public and private investment .  
While the economic reform and political stability programmes had re-established confidence in the country , Cambodia still needed a considerable volume of external assistance especially in the areas of budget support , administrative reform , mine clearance , resettlement and reintegration , agriculture , social services , the maintenance of public utility services and the rehabilitation of transport systems and infrastructure .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
In order to achieve those objectives , it was necessary to establish a modern legal framework in order to protect intellectual property and attract external resources for productive investment and , lastly , to ensure the participation of civil society and the integration of society with a view to harmonious and balanced development .  
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
In 1989 , in cooperation with the World Bank , Jordan had elaborated a comprehensive economic reform programme designed to curb inflation , reduce the growing external debt and stop the decline in the gross domestic product .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
The arsenals accumulated by some of the most repressive regimes in Africa in previous decades , with either ostensible or covert support from external Powers , had particularly deleterious consequences that stretched well into the nineties .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
There is growing recognition of the essential linkages between all aspects of external support for countries afflicted by conflict , whether political , humanitarian , developmental or human rights .  
In the efforts to find a fair and effective solution to the external debt crisis , a differential approach , based on the special problems of each individual State , should be applied .  
Poverty was particularly severe on the African continent , which experienced a wide variety of epidemic and endemic diseases , a very low literacy rate , hunger and malnutrition and heavy external debt .  
He remarked that urgent measures should be taken to erase the external debts of the developing countries , many of which were so crippled by debt servicing that they were unable to provide basic economic and social services .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .  
To the extent that globalization has enabled some countries to attract external investment leading to accelerated economic growth and thus an expanded revenue base , it has had a potentially positive impact on social provision .  
One was to reject everything that was foreign , on the reasoning that each countrys situation was unique and that external influences tended to be irrelevant at best or to undermine local uniqueness and cultural identity at worst .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The high level of unhedged private external debt made the option of devaluing the baht a painful choice that was avoided until foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted in defending the exchange rate .  
We appeal to the international community for support for the internal partnership for peace a precondition for the external initiative .  Burundi must no longer be treated in an infantile , unjust , and inequitable manner .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The representative of Cuba said that orthodox liberalization and deregulation policies had been catastrophic for the East Asian economies , which were as vulnerable to external factors as they were attractive for international capital flows . 
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .

The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
As reported in this year 's Trade and Development Report , there is ample evidence to show that Africa 's external debt burden is in fact having a severe adverse effect on both public and private investment and renewed growth .  
And as FAO has noted , the complex array of internal and external pressures acting on the fisheries sector call for responsible , timely , coordinated and comprehensive responses by national fishery administrations and regional fishery bodies if governance is to be strengthened .  
With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
Concerning external debt , the agreed formulations on problems relating to debt workouts by countries hit by financial crisis and on the slow progress in the implementation of the World Bank / IMF HIPC initiative represented a significant advance in international consensus on the subject .  
Generally speaking , however , the current extent and types of protected areas , particularly in densely populated regions , are deemed insufficient to achieve sustainable forest management due to both internal and external factors .  
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .  
The Greek Cypriot administration , which tries to present itself as the champion of conservation of cultural heritage , continues , on the one hand , to show utter contempt for what is left of the Turkish-Islamic heritage in South Cyprus , where Ottoman Turkish shrines are under threat of disintegration due to total neglect , and , on the other hand , systematically blocks the flow of any external financial or technical assistance to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for conservation purposes .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
At the same meeting , I reminded the Foreign Minister that the Group of Experts had carefully considered the feasibility of a national tribunal , but concluded that the Cambodian judiciary in its current state was unlikely to meet minimal international standards of justice , even with external assistance .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
Since Africa continued to suffer from a heavy external debt burden that contributed to the increase in poverty and affected the political and social sectors , SADC reiterated its call for urgent , effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the problems of external debt and debt servicing in the developing countries .  
In collaboration with appropriate United Nations and external partners , the subprogramme will alert the world to emerging problems by initiating periodic assessments of priority environmental issues , strengthening linkages to global and national environmental observation programmes and helping to provide authoritative information for policy formulation and implementation . 
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
Some countries have included goals and policies based on those adopted at the Summit in national strategies ; others have introduced new approaches to policy development , have renewed or maintained existing institutions or have sought additional external support . 
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Refrain from any interference , direct or indirect , individual or collective , in internal and external affairs falling within the national competence of individual States , regardless of their mutual relations , and that they shall refrain from any form of armed intervention or threat with armed intervention against another member State , as well as from undertaking political economic or other coercion ;  
Finally , he wished to stress the importance of maintaining the separate and distinct roles of internal and external oversight bodies as well as the need for oversight services not to duplicate their activities and to liaise closely in order to ensure smooth and efficient coverage of the organizations concerned .  
Other areas of UNICEF action include increasing internal and external resources to water and environmental sanitation programmes at the country and regional level , advocating the commitment of higher resources to the sector , promoting subregional collaboration among countries and working to help reach the un-served by expanding coverage through participatory community-based approaches and supporting innovative financing mechanisms for sustainability and equity .  
Lessons identified through the two independent internal and external assessments of the UNDAF pilot phase and the policy guidance provided in General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , as well as comments by agencies of the United Nations system , formed the basis for the revision of the UNDAF guidelines and shaped the modalities for the gradual extension of the UNDAF exercise to other countries , approved in April 1999 .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
The discussion focused on six main subjects : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiatives ; and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
Translation of commitment to the goals of the Conference into commensurate levels of donor funding has not been forthcoming , and there is an urgent need for donor countries to renew and intensify efforts to meet the need for complementary external resources required to implement the costed elements of the Programme of Action , that is : ( in 1993 United States dollars ) $ 5.7-billion in 2000 , $ 6.1-billion in 2005 , $ 6.8 billion in 2010 and $ 7.2-billion in 2015 .

The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .  
In this respect , a negative role is played by , among other factors , the country 's particular economic structure inherited from the former Soviet Union , which is incapable of meeting the requirements of a market economy ; Tajikistan 's geographic remoteness , which has a significant detrimental effect on external economic activity ; and mountainous terrain that makes a mere 7 per cent of our country suitable for human settlement .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The Directors stressed that the successful implementation of the financial programme , including the clearance of external and domestic arrears , would hinge crucially on a sustained increase in budget revenue and the timely implementation of agreed measures .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
That combination could only be created and maintained for so long because of the perverse mechanism that linked it to external markets ( in the northern states of the USA , by contrast , slavery never took a hold because the ecological conditions for export crops based on plantations were absent ) .  
The time has now come to offer , within the broad framework of the HIPC initiative , a rapid and complete writing off of external debt to those countries prepared to channel the resulting budget savings into an internationally recognized programme for expanding essential services in health and knowledge infrastructure - in particular education and training .  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
While the Committee is aware of the efforts undertaken by the State party to allocate substantial financial resources for the benefit of children , it reiterates its concern ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 24 , para . 8 ) that stringent budgetary measures and external debt , as well as the persistence of widespread poverty and uneven income distribution , are still having a negative impact on the situation of children in the State party .  
Under investment costs , the Secretary stated that the resource growth related , in the main , to the contractual requirements in respect of the advisory and custodial fees and for rental charges for the office space provided to the Investment Management Service ; the proposals under audit costs related to the Funds share of the costs for internal and external audits of its operations .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Inspections provide the High Commissioner with comprehensive and systematic assessments of UNHCR operations , focusing on those factors , both internal and external to UNHCR , considered most relevant to the effective and efficient discharge of UNHCRs responsibilities .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
By the same token , access to global markets that are expanding at a steady , sustained rate is crucial in allowing countries confronting external payment difficulties to undertake positive adjustment in the context of economic expansion rather than contraction .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The discussion focused on six main issues : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiative and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
In canton 6 , based on a full operational review of the Ministry of Interior and all municipal police administrations , UNMIBH has developed a " three-point plan " of concrete steps for the creation of a multi-ethnic , fully integrated professional police force , which is insulated from inappropriate external influences .  
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
In order to ensure that it can contribute to laying the foundations for enduring and coherent development , intensified international cooperation as well as countries = own national and collective efforts will be essential to address effectively the shortcomings of the external environment and the constraints of underdevelopment .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
In the area of the mobilization of external resources for development , the challenges ahead include the following : mobilizing enhanced and more stable sources of international investment flows towards a larger number of recipient developing countries ; strengthening international cooperation aimed at a reversal of the decline in ODA ; and finding lasting solutions to the debt problems of developing countries .  
Since my seventh report to the Council ( S / 1999 / 788 ) , events in the Central African Republic have been dominated to a large extent by the preparations for the presidential election by the Mixed and Independent Electoral Commission ( CEMI ) , which was assisted by MINURCA and various external donors , the campaign by political parties and the first round of the election , which took place on 19 September after two consecutive postponements .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Successful elements of those strategies included increasing penetration of external markets ; facilitating access to imported inputs ; creating an enabling environment ; improving universal primary education and access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology ; promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the competence of the civil service .  
As far as the external debt crisis was concerned , the Group of 77 and China welcomed the Cologne initiative and the enhanced HIPC framework which had been adopted at the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and which held out the promise of faster , deeper and broader relief ; a critical factor to its success would be the provision of adequate financing . 
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
The task force has divided its activities into two parts : on the one hand , the internal activities necessary to ensure the readiness of the International Bureau and the smooth functioning of all its essential systems during the year-end transition and , on the other hand , the external activities directed towards the postal administrations that are members of UPU .  
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
The Haitian National Police remains an extremely fragile institution , weakened by internal shortcomings ( administrative , disciplinary and operational ) and external pressures ( ebbing public support and an aggressive Fanmi Lavalas campaign against its leadership ) .  
In recognition of the crushing burden that external debt placed on developing nations and the resultant inability of those countries to attend to social and environmental issues , the Initiative used debt relief as an instrument for resolving many of the social and developmental problems faced by such countries .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
The problem of external debt , structural adjustment programmes , economic globalization , unequal access to commercial markets , the collapse of basic commodity prices and speculation in hard currencies are obstacles to development and are detrimental not only to the political independence of developing countries but also to their economic and development policies and their ability to forecast the evolution of their economic situation at the national and international levels .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may be either inadequate or unavailable ,  
In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
The economic weaknesses of small island developing States were well known : narrow economic base , low levels of diversification , heavy dependence on external trade ; shortage of skilled manpower ; and the brain drain .  
The new guidelines , intended for use by statistical compilers , data users and policy officials , will provide methodological standards for the compilation of statistics on external debt based on the international investment position framework and concept ; practical guidance for the compilation of these statistics ; and selected topics on the use of external debt data in the analysis of macroeconomic sustainability and external vulnerability .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
While rich countries have the transnational corporations that control over one third of all of the worlds exports , we poor countries have the asphyxiating burden of external debt , which has risen to the level of $ 2-trillion and continues to grow , devouring almost 25 per cent of our export earnings just to service our debt.How can development be possible under these conditions ? 
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
In this connection , improved terms of trade , access to international markets , increased direct foreign investments , alleviation of the external debt burden and an expanded resource base are some of the crucial issues that have to be seriously considered .  
Similarly , the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement , held at Durban in September 1998 , reiterated the Movements position , that the international community must oppose all acts of interference , external intervention and coercive economic measures and other measures , including extraterritorial laws and regulations that affect the sovereignty of States , the legitimate interests of entities and persons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and of navigation .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
The Committee considered that , since the EVI could give only a partial and approximate measure of the relative level of vulnerability of a country , a document to be called a country vulnerability profile should be prepared , for some countries , to provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of external economic and natural shocks on their economic performance and economic structure .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
National decisions and the capacity to manage land resources sustainably can also be constrained by external factors and the impacts of inappropriate development strategies pursued in the past , including unequal negotiations for rights to exploit natural resources by national and foreign companies , and poorly designed projects financed by donors which have been based on purely economic considerations .  
The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
The three-wall system is composed of a thin external layer made of aluminium spaced with an intermediate bumper made of a combination of ceramic fibres and high-strength fabric mixed with Epoxy resin ; the internal wall made of aluminium alloy is the module structure to be protected .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for further implementation in an effective , equitable and development-oriented way of existing mechanisms for the treatment of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens , and , in this context , stressing the need to agree upon equitable burden-sharing among the international public creditor community ,  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
This new Government will concentrate on implementing vigorous measures aimed at increasing State income so that the State can honour its obligations , both internal ( payment of salaries , pensions and scholarships and provision of basic social services ) and external ( particularly to the Bretton Woods institutions ) within a context of transparent management of the civil service and State enterprises . 
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
Consultations and coordination with UNCTAD , the regional commissions , IMF and the World Bank ; provision of improved global on-line access to the Project Link model for other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  
Also noteworthy was another triangular initiative in support of Cuba ' s economic recovery , under which expertise was transferred from Brazil , Chile and Mexico , with triangular support provided by Norway , in macroeconomic policy formulation , national budgeting , central banking accounting , treasury functions , commercial banking and external debt management .  
The analysis seems to support the conclusion that TCDC has been more successful in those countries where government has put in place explicit TCDC policy linked with national development planning process ; established a strong TCDC focal point with the necessary supporting structure ; and earmarked national budgetary allocations or devised means for innovative use of external assistance , including triangular cooperation .  
While SADC welcomed debt-relief initiatives , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt initiative , it believed that the international community should start writing off the external debt of those countries that had made visible and sustainable progress in the implementation of tough structural adjustment measures and political reforms , so that they could invest the resources thus freed up in social sectors .  
The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .  
The Commission had stressed the need for promoting increased transparency and appropriate accountability for the implementation of sound national and corporate development policies , which enhance a country ' s abilities to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and volatile flows of short-term capital . 
Access to the markets of developed countries , the reduction in the external debt of heavily indebted developing countries , together with an increase in ODA , should be the key elements of any credible international policy designed to find a lasting solution to the problem of financing for development .  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
Although , he recognized the views expressed by some Governments and academics that the right to self-determination included both an external and an internal aspect and that the latter applied to groups within existing States , he argued that there was not yet international consensus in that respect .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
With regard to the external world , the United Arab Emirates has signed a number of agreements and memorandums of understanding and arranged cultural and informational exchanges in the area of education at the bilateral , regional and international level .  
As the main determinants of transparency , environmental reports of TNCs , internal and external , voluntary and mandatory , must provide a credible portrait of their global activities .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Such factors were exacerbated by shortsighted international trade and financial practices , the unsustainable external debt burden , uncontrolled economic growth , particularly in urban areas , and the growing inequality among countries .  
United by strong natural , historic , social and cultural ties , that community would offer a single focus for investment and tourism and a single market with a common external tariff and would facilitate the free flow of goods , services and people .  
SADC was firmly resolved to reduce poverty through sustained and broadbased economic growth and equitable distribution of social services , but the enormous burden of external debt inhibited the full economic and social development of the region . 
The Territory was unique in that the shift of national power to external agents during the century or so of colonialism had had little practical impact on everyday life , for the political and cultural reality that everyone knew and understood was the village .  
However , while economic growth has remained positive on average , the rate of growth has not been sustainable because it was based on external factors such as good weather and favourable commodity prices .  
The LDCs continued to be marginalized in global economic activities , ODA had declined substantially and the external debt burden had reached alarming proportions , while foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and exports and imports had been reduced .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
In the economic sphere , specific aspects , such as internal and external financing , modern services , and variations in the value of physical and financial stocks will be considered . 
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
As a postconflict country , Liberia is still a fragile political setting , with limited internal resources , growing poverty , and dwindling external assistance , which constitute important factors militating against smooth transition .  
The underlying weakness of the social services in a number of LDCs is that they were established or instituted on the availability of external loans and grants rather than on the basis of strong , vibrant and growing domestic production and economic base .  
We are exposed to sudden external shocks , such as regional conflicts , increases in international oil prices , declines in copper prices , harsh weather patterns and financial crises .  
The Divisions main role is to ensure that UNHCR communicates a coherent , consistent and convincing message to the external environment , thereby mobilizing public , political and financial support for the work of the Office .  
The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
There was a need for financial investment , free access to markets , and improved external conditions for trade , financial and economic activities ; it was also imperative that such countries should benefit from additional official development assistance .  
Finally , he said that Governments , organizations and the entire international community must work together to create favourable internal and external conditions for gradual economic growth and successful , socially oriented sustainable growth for all States .  
What has been missing is the supportive external economic environment that has been considered critical to ensure accelerated development in developing countries .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
In response to those changes in the internal and external environment , the United Nations had elaborated a set of core values and competencies , improved human resources planning , streamlined the personnel manual and expanded the staff training program .  
While this debt may be manageable under rapid growth circumstances and in an otherwise favourable economic environment , their situation leaves them very vulnerable to abrupt changes in internal or external factors .  
To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety , international civil servants must not accept , without authorization from the executive head , any honour , decoration , gift , remuneration , favour or economic benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations ; it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and other entities .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
It consists of the need to help the people of Afghanistan establish a responsible , representative , accountable and stable Government which enjoys internal and external legitimacy ; is committed to respecting and promoting the rights of all its men , women and children ; enjoys peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbours ; and is able to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be used as a breeding and staging ground for terrorists or drug-traffickers .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
While international efforts could create conducive conditions for economic development , the primary responsibility for a nations development lay with its Government and people , and discussions on financing growth the development should focus on how to help LDCs mobilize domestic financial resources and attract external resources .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
The objectives and expected accomplishments detailed in table 27A . 8 above are expected to be achieved on the assumption that : ( a ) sufficient financial resources will be made available for maintaining adequate technical infrastructure and monitoring mechanisms ; and ( b ) programme managers will be supportive of the Oversight Support Unit efforts and extend their full cooperation in the implementation of recommendations of the external oversight bodies .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Translating and revising documents , official correspondence and publications ; providing quality control of in-house and contractual translation ; providing reference and terminology services for translators , interpreters and editors , as well as for external contractors ; outsourcing translation , editing , proof-reading , typesetting , typing and other work ; providing assistance and feedback to contractors ; coordinating the quality-control system for outsourced jobs ; maintaining , updating and expanding the roster of individual and corporate contractors ; preparing contracts ; and providing the requisite administrative data ; ( b ) Editorial services . 
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
The Unit is the only system-wide independent external oversight body , and it is accountable to the General Assembly and the competent legislative organs of the specialized agencies and other international organizations within the United Nations system that accept its statute .  
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Based on common international understandings that respect diversity and specific country circumstances , these national efforts should be supported by an enabling international environment , including good international financial and trade governance and adequate external resources mobilization .  
Others for different reasons , including domestic economic mismanagement , conflicts , natural catastrophes and external economic shocks , such as terms of trade changes , international interest rate hikes or contagion are faced with difficult or even unbearable debt burdens .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
In addition , it had found that the frequent rotation of senior managers had had a detrimental effect on key policing projects and alliances formed with external agencies and community leaders , and had determined that such managers should consequently be employed for longer periods .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
Declining availability of financial resources , domestic and external , including ODA , a heavy and unsustainable debt burden , falling or volatile commodity prices , complex trade barriers , lack of economic and export diversification and market access for key products which LDCs benefit from , as well as supply-side constraints , have seriously affected the growth and development prospects of LDCs .  
It is recognized that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals . 
To protect the poor in the short run and sustain progress already achieved towards the international development goals , Fund-supported programmes continue to include social safety nets to cushion the negative impact of economic reforms and external shocks on vulnerable groups .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires , inter alia , a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of ODA ) , to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
Despite new measures taken to adjust course , the new Government has inherited runaway inflation , monetary instability , a persistent fiscal deficit , a very heavy external debt and a climate of great social tension .  
In implementing its interim programme , the Government thus faces a serious problem of external financing , which is essential in view of the countrys meagre domestic resources and the unresolved problem of its external debt arrears , which stands in the way of conventional official development assistance mechanisms .  
It calls for the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative on the basis of mutual agreement and commitment by donors and least developed countries , and recognizes that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and from external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
Several challenges which faced the implementation of commitments and for monitoring included : the need to reverse the declining trend in the levels of external resources , including the need for a substantial increase in the UNCTAD LDCs Trust Fund ; and the need to improve the measurement tools through the strengthening of national statistical systems to generate and manage relevant data in LDCs , as recognized in the Programme of Action .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
Poverty , along with other situations of marginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the worlds people , including the denial of human dignity , the lack of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , social dislocation , intolerable refugee situations , internal and external displacement and physical and psychological oppression , are breeding grounds just waiting to be exploited by terrorists .  
However , favourable external conditions were equally necessary ; the current international economic system must be reformed to meet the challenges of globalization and growing interdependence among countries and made more equitable by increasing the decision-making power of the developing countries .  
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
First of all , an equitable international economic order should be established which did not blindly impose globalization on developing countries but instead included an equitable trading system , reform of the international financial institutions and a solution to the external debt problem .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
The new format , which was intended to reflect an approach that was more qualitative than quantitative , set forth the objectives around which each programme had been designed , as well as expected accomplishments , indicators of achievement and external factors that could affect the level of success in meeting those expectations .  
Welcomes the convening of the donor meetings for East Timor at Tokyo in December 1999 , at Lisbon in June 2000 , at Brussels in December 2000 , at Canberra in June 2001 and at Oslo in December 2001 , which focused on the national budget and the transition towards independence in East Timor in four key areas : political , public administration , public finances , and economic and social reconstruction , and urges the international community to fulfil its pledges to meet the external requirements for rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities for East Timor ;  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
The meeting noted ( a ) the importance of adopting poverty monitoring plans agreed by all stakeholders , with external assistance to promote the dialogue ; ( b ) the need for strategic statistical plans to be jointly developed by all stakeholders , including planners , civil society , donors and the international community ; and ( c ) that the generation of community-level statistics was facilitated through cost-sharing , for example , when local authorities funded the field costs of surveys in their locality .  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
In this way Bahrain criminalizes terrorist acts , and they constitute a crime against the external or internal security of the State whether the offence is committed in Bahrain or elsewhere , whether by a national or an alien and whether the person concerned is a primary perpetrator or an accessory to the crime .  
Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
The task of preparing for the arrival of external drilling contractors for the almost 400 new wells planned is an enormous one , requiring numerous access roads , earth-moving and foundation works to allow access to the incoming drilling units and to construct , repair and maintain surface facilities required to treat current and future crude oil production flows before export or refining can be undertaken .

The key to Taiwan 's ability to maintain a relatively stable economic situation on the island under the financial crisis since July 1997 lies in the mainland 's stable economy , firm Renminbi , and vast consumer market , which have stabilized Taiwan 's trade with and investment in the mainland and thus stabilized Taiwan 's external trade to ensure normal functioning of the island 's economy .  
The garrison has introduced an external spokesman system and has regularly held Open Day at its barracks with an eye on enhancing understanding or communication between itself and the Hong Kong public .  Practice has shown that the garrison has established fine , harmonious , and mutual-trust army-government relations with the SAR government and has forcefully safeguarded a high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Hong Kong SAR in such a special environment as " One Country , Two Systems " .  
Over the last five years , in the face of all difficulties arising in the very complicated internal and external environments and economic ad social life , we have always regarded speeding up development as a basic guiding ideology in the economic work , upheld employing methods of development to revolve issues in our forging ahead , adopted a series of policies and measures to promote economic developments , and maintained relatively fast speed developments . 
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
Compared to the rather complicated and profound changes of last year , the international situation this year has been relatively stable with no major collisions .  What is particularly conspicuous is the fact that various countries have been making adjustments to their internal and external policies that are oriented to the new century .  
The government has strengthened contacts and consultations with the United States , European Union , and some other major trade partners with an eye on securing a stable external environment for Macao 's export trade .  In the meantime , the government has also actively helped transform traditional industries and has ensured that Macao 's products will keep abreast with global development and remain competitive .  
[ Dai ] According to the major tasks and work plans set by our party and country for the new century , our initial plan is that the party 's external work at the beginning of the new century should become an important component of the integrated strategy of safeguarding the country 's comprehensive security , promoting its total democracy , and realizing a complete national reunification .

Based on the Law of Officers on Active Service in the People 's Republic of China , by implementing systems of officer selection from ordinary universities and colleges , promoting outstanding soldiers and graduates through military academies , the practices have broadened the selection resources of military officers through both channels of internal promotion : military training and external recruitment from ordinary schools of high learning .  In this way , the basic qualities of prospective officers have a sound basis .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
On 29 April , Li Ruogu , assistant president of the People 's Bank of China and deputy Chinese director of the IMF , called on developed countries to make greater effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , maintain the stability of exchange rates between major currencies , and thus create a better external environment for economic growth in developing countries .

In addition to the ongoing economic restructuring and the changes in the external economic environment , the worsening economic situation in Taiwan was mainly caused by the turbulent political situation , the confused financial and economic policies , the uncertainty in cross-strait relations , and the shaken confidence among the people after the new government took power .  In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
At a seminar today , Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China noted : This year , the general international economic environment is unfavorable to economic growth in developing countries , and that will have a rather great impact on economic development in major countries and regions in Asia . Therefore , Asian countries and regions should strengthen cooperation , overcome the unfavorable effects of the external environment , and strive for the steady development of their national economies .  
Dai Xianglong analyzed and said that the breakout of the Asian financial crisis had not only internal factors , but also many external factors .  After the Asian financial crisis , various Asian countries intensified their in-depth structural adjustments and financial reorganization , handled bad assets , lowered the debt rates of the enterprises , directly or indirectly promoted economic recovery and growth , and basically maintained the stability of financial operation .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
Jia Chunwang , minister of public security , recently inspected work in Guangdong and required that local authorities in all parts of the country deeply advance the strike hard anti-crime campaign aimed at cracking down on syndicated crime and criminal organizations with the Mafia characteristics , and in particular , resolutely deal blows at the infiltration of the external underworld .  
In coping with external military threats , Russia , which is resolutely opposed to NATO 's expansion to the east , has put forward a proposal for establishing , with European countries , a rapid reaction force to maintain the security of Europe . Moreover , Russia has held many large-scale military exercises with the Commonwealth of Independent States and established a " collective air-defense system " in the western part of Russia .  
As a matter of fact , in analyzing the major cause to the chaotic political situation in Taiwan , the public opinion and some political and academic figures on the island pointed out in the same way without prior consultation : First , in the past year since the leader of the Taiwan authorities took office , he has not taken actual measures to relax and improve cross-strait relations and to dispel the people 's misgiving about his seeking " Taiwan independence " and this has caused the Taiwan society to have an unstable external environment .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .  
Although the external environment for exports in China 's foreign trade in the second half of the year may become even more complicated , we should notice that the international market is still expanding and there is still room and huge potential for the country and different localities to increase exports .

An expert said that China 's steady economic growth was not easy at a time of worldwide economic slowdown .  He said China 's economy could maintain its great vitality because of the pull from stronger internal demand when external demand was low .  
Basing ourselves on the long period of socialist construction , we have practiced new policies of reform and opening to the outside world and formulated the basic theory , line and program of our party in the initial stage of socialism after summing up both the internal and external historical experience and through hard exploration .  
For the first time , it gives a systematical reply to a series of basic questions concerning the development course of socialism , development stage of socialism , fundamental tasks of socialism , development driving forces , external conditions , political guarantees , strategic steps , the party 's leadership , the reliable forces , and the motherland 's reunification in China .

The questions set in the polls of the " Ministry of Foreign Affairs " did point out that " the existing system and way of life will be retained . "  However , keeping in mind the fact that Taiwan is an island and its people are afraid of losing their freedom of external connections , they emphasized that " Taiwan will not have any diplomatic power from now on , " which was also intended as a threat .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
At present this extremely reactionary view of history has not yet formed into the main current in Japanese society , and although the sound of just condemnation in society of past external aggression is not as loud as it was 20 or 30 years ago , it can not be ignored .  
Indeed , by issuing the above circular , the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom Industries has made a major move to rectify order on China 's telecommunication market , and to prevent external forces , especially those in the radio , movie , and television sector , from making a roundabout entry into the market .  Given this , it seems that China 's program for " merging three networks " has an uncertain future .  
Nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable Renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system .  If the value of Japanese yen plummets and the US dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than Renminbi itself .  
We should no longer solidify the previous examination and approval system and the industrial policies of mercantilism , and the government should change its keynote of public policies to more open-minded industrial policies , which include steady and sound macroeconomic policies , transparent legal system , and better external public conditions and facilities .  
The " one country , two systems " formula is a new attempt unprecedented in human history .  However , Hong Kong people have succeeded .  Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .

According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
Viewing from international experiences and lessons , there should be at least two prerequisites for opening the financial industry of a country : First , the external environment is stable and safe , and the financial industry will not be subject to frequent and tremendous impacts after it is opened to the outside world ;  
In close connection with the changes in the internal and external situation , with the reality of the latest development of China 's social productive forces and the profound changes in the economic system , with the demands of the masses for new development in material and cultural life , and with the new conditions and changes in the ranks of party members and cadres , we should ponder in depth how to adhere still better to the " three represents , " and make efforts to find answers from linking theory with reality .  
Part of that , 191.053 billion yuan , was used to repay the principal and interest of internal and external debts ; 179.16 billion yuan was spent reducing the deficit for the year ; and the remaining 1.29 billion yuan was used to replenish the central fiscal sinking fund .  
Economic experts here said that the good trend of national economic operation and the smooth progress in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises are the result of the implementation of both the CPC Central Committee and State Council measure to expand domestic demand and the pro-active fiscal policy .  Measures to crack down hard on smuggling and to encourage exports have provided a favorable external environment and market space for the turnaround of state enterprises .  
They require as the basis for their generation scientific theoretical understanding , and protracted influence by rich practical experience and environment , and they can certainly not be generated by simply relying on preaching or external coercion .  Education in ideals and beliefs , therefore , must be closely connected to the actual state of mind of the cadres and masses , and it particularly necessary to make an issue of " the new problems , " have definite objects in view , and carry out the education in a fair and reasonable way .  
Ye Zhen put it frankly : China 's present economic pickup is more of a product of policy and external factors , as the economic growth is still lacking in intrinsic vitality , the insufficiency of effective social demand has not yet been fundamentally alleviated , economic structural problems are conspicuous , consumer goods market exploitation is still " obstructed , " and the growth of peasants ' income is slowing down .  
Fifth , the province should take further steps to perfect its social security system and maintain social stability ; create a favorable external environment for a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ;  
The facts are , since assuming office on 1 July 1997 , Chief Executive Tung has led the SAR government in smoothly and effectively overcoming the assaults of a string of external factors as well as the political , social , economic , and people 's livelihood problems left over from the British Hong Kong Government era to win the central government 's great trust internally and international commendation externally .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
With respect to external policy , he made great efforts to push the so-called " pragmatic diplomacy " to expand Taiwan 's " international living space , " promote Taiwan 's accession to the United Nations and other international organizations in order to seek Taiwan 's " international legal subject " and its " independent international person " status in a vain attempt to create " two Chinas , " or " one China , one Taiwan " in the world .  
Also , according to public opinion , some people from the authorities should not indulge in " performances " and instead should put the Taiwan people 's well-being above everything else and publish feasible financial and economic policies and take measures to prevent the spread of disorderliness and outbreak of crises as soon as possible so as to create an internal and external environment favorable to the stock market 's recovery .  
Putin 's diplomatic maneuvering of the last several months shows that in his foreign policy , he has a long-term strategic goal as well as strong consideration of the reality .  His overall foreign policy goal is defined as " ensuring national security " and " developing a good external environment for economic growth " to revitalize Russia .  
Resolving only the issue of poverty in developing countries is far from enough .  It is essential to create a favorable external environment for developing countries , provide them with capital , technological , and manpower support , and help them eliminate the " digital gap , " so that all countries of the world can seek common development and prosperity in the process of economic globalization .  
In light of the new situation that has occurred in maintaining and developing a healthy and pure internal relationship in the military , they should strengthen the awareness of the cadres of " taking a correct attitude and commanding the troops in a civilized manner " and the awareness of military personnel regarding " respecting cadres and obeying management , " strengthen the unity between officers and men , and improve internal and external relationships .  
The Chinese Government will do its utmost to offer a fine external environment for the international exchange of qualified personnel , will meet international standards in accession of qualified personnel , market regulations , and intermediary services , and take the road suited to its national conditions and also conforming to general international standards .  
Given the demand of our national economic development and our commitments for WTO membership , our country is bound to open up more fields to the outside world , especially such service sectors as banking , insurance , telecommunications , foreign trade , commerce , tourism , and so on , step by step , and this is bound to create a favorable external environment for positively and effectively utilizing a growing amount of foreign capital . 
He said : China has consistently pursued the principle of non-interference in other countries ' internal affairs and respected the choice of the Yugoslav people .  China believes that the Yugoslav people are fully capable of solving their current problem free from external interference .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : " Closing coal pits and reducing production " and eliminating backward production capacity are aimed at creating external conditions for helping Datong Coal Mine end deficits and eliminate difficulties .  In addition , this is also an essential requirement for Shanxi Province to adjust economic structure , raise economic efficiency , and improve the ecological environment , and is an important link for successfully running state-owned key coal enterprises .  We must be determined to firmly grasp this work well .  
Wu Bangguo said : As a traditional industry , the coal industry has to shoulder a heavy historical burden .  In the current process , in which great changes have taken place in market supply and demand and the old economic system is being changed into the new , it is difficult for coal enterprises themselves to completely overcome difficulties they have encountered .  The government must make efforts to create an essential external environment and conditions in all aspects and give them specific support and assistance .  
On the other hand , aiming at the goal of ultimately becoming an extraordinarily large high-tech transnational group with fairly strong competitiveness , actively develop external economic relations and carry out business expansion on the international scene and export of technologies and labor service to make the contributions expected of us in enabling China 's aerospace [ industry ] to rank among the first in the world .

At present , Chen Shui-bian and the fundamentalist faction of the DPP have already been surrounded by Taiwan 's political and economic crises , are exposed to attacks on all sides and are plagued with both internal and external troubles .  There is no other way out for them except abandoning the " Taiwan independence " program , transforming themselves , accepting the " one-China principle , " and correcting their incorrect line and policies .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
To resolve problems that currently exist in such aspects of our work as prison , reeducation through labor , lawyer , notarization , and basic-level of legal services ; and to eliminate the contradictions of irrational structures , imperfect mechanisms , and unsatisfactory coordination between internal and external relations , a fundamental way out is to carry out the reform , and to seek and boost the development through the reform .  We must establish a correct outlook on the reform and development ;  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
China , as a friendly neighbor of Cambodia , supports the Cambodian people 's endeavor in consolidating national reconciliation , safeguarding national sovereignty , and developing the economy .  China believes that , under the leadership of King Sihanouk , the Cambodian people certainly can successfully deal with all the internal and external challenges , surmount their difficulties , and build Cambodian into a country with happy people enjoying national harmony , political stability , and economic prosperity .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
The practice in the last two years showed that a major way to foster large enterprises with international competitive power is to select a batch of large-sized and super-sized enterprises for being listed in external capital markets after reorganization and restructuring .  
Deputy Li Rixu said : To deepen reforms in state-owned enterprises and really turn them into the main entities in the market competition , it is necessary to actively explore an effective form of managing the state-owned assets , deepen the three institutional reforms inside the enterprises , establish effective incentive and self-control mechanisms ; it is also necessary to more quickly advance various supportive reforms , thus creating a benign external environment for state-owned enterprises ' reform and development .  The work of separating the government from enterprises should be further advanced .  
The CPPCC organizations at all levels should continue to carry out the basic principle of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and the eight-point proposal set forth by President Jiang Zemin , actively promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel visits , strive to unite all internal and external forces that can be united , resolutely oppose any attempt to split the motherland , and make contributions to accomplishing the great cause of reunifying the motherland .

" All the favourable conditions in Hong Kong which have underpinned our robust development in the past , such as our prudent financial policy , low taxation , sound financial and banking regulation , first-rate infrastructural facilities are still there and unaffected by external factors . " 
I am confident that , with our strong fundamentals , coupled with our flexibility of adaptation to external shock , and with the extent of price and cost adjustment that our free market economy has allowed us to go through up to now , our economy should be able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums , once the regional situation has settled , and our outlook beyond that remains bright . 
" Potential dangers may arise from dilapidated canopies or defective external renderings , dangerous or abandoned advertisement signs , unauthorised building works , defective or inadequate drains and water carrying services buried in or in the vicinity of slopes , " Dr Choi said .

While we will exert ourselves in achieving this objective , I believe that we also need to take account , in my view , of four main factors which will be crucial to our recovery .  These are : an improvement in the external , financial and economic environment ; a steadying of our interest rates here ; stability in the property market ; and above all , a return of public confidence .

Since the country went ahead with reform and open door policy in 1978 , Hong Kong businesses have been actively involved in investment and trade in the coastal provinces , developing external trade in tandem with local enterprises .

While the current account continued to record a large surplus upon the export boom and the net inflow of external factor income , the financial non-reserve assets also switched back to a net inflow in the second quarter , mostly due to a substantial inflow of direct investment into Hong Kong but also upon a continued net inflow of portfolio investment fund .  
Compared with the same quarter in 1999 , the current account surplus in the third quarter of 2000 was characterised by a marked increase in visible trade deficit , a decrease in net external factor income inflow , and a continued net outflow of current transfers , which were offset in part by a substantial rise in invisible trade surplus .

Looking at it from the point of view of the domestic and external economic situations , the outlook is not very rosy . Because just now the world economy is performing poorly , market expansion is extremely tough .

Firstly , the Yin &amp; Yang principles described in the I-ching ( Classic of Changes ) can indicate many polarities such as the sun &amp; moon , day &amp; night , light &amp; dark , motion &amp; rest , internal &amp; external , cold &amp; heat , hard &amp; soft , and male &amp; female .  
After all , perhaps , lay people 's belief in Buddhism and Buddhist worship may stem from a worldly viewpoint of bringing them tangible success . They seek support from the bodhisattvas ' spiritual power to guard them against evil , but they fail to cultivate inner awareness or attain the inner tranquility and joy that come from dispelling selfish attachments and external concerns about fortune or misfortune . In contrast to Manjusri with his metaphysical ideas of prajna wisdom , Samantabhadra and his message of " great action " exemplifies a much more concrete aspect of Buddhism .  
Classical neo - - Mannerist architecture favors round pillars and gables , and the external walls are mostly decorated with white false stone ; it is relatively stately . Non-classical neo-Mannerist architecture includes Byzantine-style or the North European traditional brick construction ; the outside is relatively complex , luxurious , and free-wheeling .  
At present , the ROC 's total external trade is fifteenth largest in the world ; GNP is ranked 25th in the world , even exceeding Luxembourg , an OECD member ; twenty continuous years of trade surpluses have accumulated one of two largest - - if not the largest - - foreign exchange reserves in the world ; foreign investment in Southeast Asia is second only to Japan .  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
Sometimes I separate my use of black-and - white and color photographs : For external things , such as traditional street festivals , I use color , while I use black-and-white to express the unseen , what is hidden .  
And they ca n't refuse these evenings out but must attend to them like their regular duties in the office . " At the same time as paying close attention to the course of the conversation between the two main parties , they also force themselves to try to be witty and interesting , so as to make the scene more festive , " says Li Tao , director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , speaking from personal experience .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
He says that in South Africa there is a scientist who has studied black eagles for more than twenty years . The male and female black eagle are completely identical in their external physical features , but through many years of observation , she became able to distinguish the male and female of a pair of black eagles flying together , from their attitude and position .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
We discovered that China in the Year 1 was in the Han dynasty , which established the foundations of Chinese systems in many areas . It was an era also of dynastic struggles , filled with heroes and striking personalities . At the Year 1000 , the Song dynasty had reunified China . Its weakness forced it into a form of " economic diplomacy " to fend off the peoples of the north , yet at the same time this demilitarization of external relations led to splendorous achievements in culture and wealth for society as a whole .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs . Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men . A case in point : Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look . They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .  
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . But do n't overdo it . It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .  
Buddhism and Taoism seemed less useful than Confucianism in resolving worldly problems . Confucianism thus entered a period of creative transformation in order to meet external challenges to the state . Zhu Xi 's influence proved greater than that of other philosophers because of his work integrating various schools of thought , doing textual research , and annotating the classics . For example , prior to the Song dynasty , The Great Learning was not a very influential work in China .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
China has successfully withstood external political pressure and has scored rapid economic development , he said , adding that it has a traditional friendship with other developing countries and supports them in their demand for a just and equitable international economic order , and is providing assistance in funds and technology to them  
On the external debt issue , she said as many developing countries are still faced with the difficulties caused by heavy external debt burdens , it is imperative that further measures aimed at a comprehensive , effective and durable solution of the problem should be explored  
during the past five years , the chinese government has unswervingly pursued an independent foreign policy of peace , li said in his report on government work this not only has helped create an external environment favorable to china 's reform , opening up and modernization , but also contributed to world peace and common development  
With minimal encouragement from external sources , Somalia 's formal and informal private sector in all regions long ago began the task of breathing life into commercial and trading activities .  
Past mediation efforts have been shown to be insufficient because they were limited by a mandate lacking firmness , but also rendered more difficult by the diverse political interests of individual external forces .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
In this case , pressure from the international community , including its global and regional political bodies , and the persistent efforts of certain internal and external groups led to a series of negotiations without precedent .  
Despite earnest efforts to carry out structural adjustments in their national economic policies , most African countries have found little reprieve from the unfavourable external economic environment , harsh climatic conditions , civil war and strife .

Although a larger flow of external funding and assistance to human settlements development is a desirable outcome , sustainability can only be achieved in the medium and long term by using scarce external resources in a strategic and catalytic way .  
Partnerships that link the public and private sectors ; external , national and local institutions ; and public organizations with nongovernmental organizations and community groups are essential for sustainable human settlement development .  
This programme is based on joint endeavours initiated by UNDP but led by participating countries and with a substantive participation of external partners , including bilateral donors and international and regional institutions and organizations .  
The continuing lack of accelerated growth in the regional economy is a vivid reminder that the underlying structural constraints and extreme vulnerabilities to external shocks that provoked the African crises in the first place are still very much with us .  
The difficult socioeconomic conditions , exacerbated by deteriorating and fluctuating terms of trade , external indebtedness and political instability , which induce internal , regional and international migrations ;  
During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
As all who had emerged from long periods of colonial rule were well aware , factors both internal and external could reduce independence to a mere legal formality unless it had solid economic foundations .  
The total stock of external debt in the least developed countries represented nearly three quarters of their combined gross domestic product .  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
In addition to the external disputes of international organizations , relatively important internal disputes could also arise which did not lend themselves to settlement by reference to the model established by national constitutional or administrative norms .  
The internal difficulties experienced by Yemen during the course of the year had been exploited by external forces with the objective of impeding the development of a free , democratic and prosperous society in Yemen .  
Develop economic policies to mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
It was essential that the international community should recognize the decisive role it had to play in the creation of a favourable external economic environment and improving market access for products from the developing countries .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,

Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , and considering that such assistance should be expanded further , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance ,  
Along with reform in all aspects of social life , Viet Nam has consistently pursued its foreign policy of broad openness , the thrust of which is to diversify and multilateralize its external relations in order to create a stable environment and external conditions conducive to the task of building and defending the country , and to enhance Viet Nam 's position on the international scene .  
There is a need , as a matter of priority that should be addressed with courage and creativity , to reformulate policies and solutions to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries that would help create a climate of equal opportunity amongst peoples and nations and make use of the latent potential of many parts of the world in paving the way towards balanced and comprehensive development at the threshold of the twenty-first century .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
Because the sanctions regime , in practical terms , upsets the normal and balanced functioning of the economy of whole adjoining regions , undermining their entire economic infrastructure and rupturing external economic links , we need a mechanism for the careful consideration , before any decision is taken on imposing sanctions against any country , of the potential consequences of such a step both for the country targeted by the sanctions and for third countries .  
It should be remembered that this progress has been made in an internal and external economic context that has been generally unfavourable , because of the continuing constraints that are impeding any process of stable and sustained development .  
It has been said , but can not be repeated enough and no school of thought , no economic-development specialist can contradict me that the development process in Africa will come to a standstill if the efforts of the African States continue to be bogged down by the burden of external debt , if flows of capital continue to be insufficient , if the obstacles limiting market access persist , if commodities are not diversified or changed and if the terms of trade remain depressed .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
The difficulties besetting African countries are still present : the crushing burden of external debt , the steady deterioration of the terms of trade , the scant inflow of resources and direct foreign investment and the continued degradation of the environment because of the growing , interrelated pressures of the population and poverty .  
Given much-needed support to the developing countries as they reactivate their economies and creating a favourable external environment for them are not only important conditions for the shared economic growth and common prosperity of all countries , but also a crucial guarantee for lasting peace and stability throughout the world .  
The African Group believes that the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda will provide to Africa and the international community an opportunity to conduct an in-depth assessment of the actions so far taken to implement the New Agenda and the measures needed for sustained economic growth and sustainable development beyond the 1990s , as well as to set out new and corrective policies and measures for strengthened external support .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
The programme covered areas where the secretariat had established operational capacities and addressed such specific areas as export diversification and trade development , customs and trade facilitation , trade statistics , debt management , external financial flows and investments , domestic financial markets , insurance and transport , as well as the regulatory framework affecting those areas and the business environment in general .  
Develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
It holds promise for increasing the yield , quality , efficient processing and utilization of products ; for decreasing reliance on agro-chemicals and other external inputs ; and for improving the conservation and use of genetic and other natural resources .  
Although NATCAP began without a coherent strategy and with a heavy reliance on external inputs , the current generation of NATCAP countries have evolved to a point where there is substantial national content with increased reliance on in-country task forces .  
Recognizing that the mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action is of particular significance as it will provide an opportunity to the international community to set out new and corrective policies and measures , including strengthened external support to the least developed countries in all areas , to support their efforts so as to ensure the timely , effective and full implementation of the Programme of Action during the remainder of the decade ,  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
At consultations held in 1994 at Bellagio , Italy , and Coppet , Switzerland , on the theme " Refocusing UNEP " , it was concluded that UNEP should reorient its current programme , emphasize strategic and intellectual leadership rather than operational activities and develop the substantive and managerial capacity to catalyse external resources effectively .  
The situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is marked by a complex network of external and internal factors that contribute to economic and political uncertainty and rising social tension .  
In 1993 , the total stock of external debt ( measured at current prices and exchange rates ) rose by 5 per cent - much less than gross domestic product ( GDP ) - to $ 1,630-billion , with much of this attributable to growth of debt stocks in Asia as well as to valuation effects .  
In part this is because of the role of external forces ( e.g . , economic growth and interest rates in the OECD area ) in " diverting " funds from OECD economies to the emerging markets and also because other influences are of a transient or finite nature ( e.g . , resulting from privatizations and returning flight capital ) .  
Positive and negative developments in the external and national policy environments as well as successful and unsuccessful macroeconomic and microeconomic policies are reflected in the amount of resources available for the financing of cross-sectoral issues and sectoral finance .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , and considering that such assistance should be expanded further , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance ,  
Among the problems the subprogramme will address are those related to improving international purchasing and supply management methods and practices , inappropriate procurement procedures and organizational structures , insufficient external and internal information for import planning and supply management , lack of skilled personnel and limited availability of import support services .  
At its twenty-fifth session , held in April 1994 , the Commission approved the present programme of work , paying special attention to the situation of the economies of the region , which have been characterized by expansion of economic activity with relative price stability , vast inflows of external capital and some relief from the debt burden .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
The estimated requirements of $ 19,700 , reflecting negative growth of $ 31,500 , relate to the following expenditures : ( a ) public information production : reduced requirements of $ 10,600 would cover the cost of engaging external marketing research organizations and other related contractual services with a view to ensuring that the Department 's outputs are responsive to targeted audiences and their identified needs ; and ( b ) subscription to news agency services ( $ 9,100 ) . 
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The provision ( $ 259,700 ) reflects a negative growth of $ 339,600 and would provide for the external printing costs of the Yearbook of the International Law Commission ( $ 27,700 ) ; and honoraria of the Chairman and 32 members of the Commission , one member being excluded from accepting the payment by national legislation , and additional amounts payable to 6 special rapporteurs , at the rates set by the General Assembly in its resolution 35 / 218 of 17 December 1980 ( $ 232,000 ) . 
Adjustments in this direction have involved increasing popular participation , promoting peaceful inter-State relations and enhancing regional security and stability , increasing the participation of enterprises and cooperation among them and their associations , expanding cooperation with major external partners , including in some instances through the formation of preferential trading agreements , and restructuring the policy organs and executive secretariats of groupings .  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
Such crises may save various sources , continue for varying periods of time , and disrupt governmental performance to varying degrees , but their primary characteristic is that the existing national Government is unable to meet the immediate daily requirements of its population or to build a viable basis for sustainable development without external assistance .  
Countries may experience disruption of their governmental systems from at least three major sources : massive natural disasters , such as earthquakes , cyclones , or volcanic eruptions ; internal civil strife ; or external conflict / war with neighbouring States .  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .  
The uncertain global economic climate has been accompanied by economic restructuring as well as , in a certain number of countries , persistent , unmanageable levels of external debt and structural adjustment programmes . "  Fifth sentence .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
They continued to suffer the effects of an unfavourable economic environment characterized by the ongoing deterioration in the terms of trade , their staggering external debt burden and currency devaluations imposed under structural adjustment programmes , and aggravated by the negative impact of the agreements resulting from multilateral trade negotiations .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , i.e . of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In addition , the Commission requested the Executive Secretary of ECA and the Director-General of UNIDO to hold consultative meetings of sponsoring countries and organizations with indigenous and external potential investors as well as African and non-African financial institutions , for the purpose of identifying , formulating and undertaking feasibility studies and financing of specific bankable projects with basic industries .  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , that is , of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Reaffirming its resolution 48 / 165 of 21 December 1993 on the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership and 48 / 166 of 21 December 1993 on an agenda for development , Reaffirming also the urgent need for a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is required to contribute to a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also with concern the urgent need to fully address the problem of the combined external debt stock of developing countries , bearing in mind the special and critical situation of the most indebted developing countries in Africa and the least developed countries ,  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Recognizes that a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries will have a substantial impact on sustaining the strength of the global economy and will greatly contribute to efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Factors such as a strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates and have helped these countries to address some of the constraints facing their economies .  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt servicing-problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , the Prime Minister of Fiji had stressed the importance of working to redress some of the wrongs that history had wrought upon indigenous peoples and guaranteeing that external values and forces did not continue to impose political concessions , economic reforms and social changes that were not desired by indigenous people themselves .  
International Law Fellowship Programme had made a worthwhile contribution to the programme for the current biennium ; it would be desirable for the Hague Academy of International Law to have additional funds , from voluntary contributions , so that its very successful external courses could be offered more frequently and extended to more geographical areas .  
the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,

it was true that the staff representatives had contacted the external employers to dissuade them from participating in a badly organized survey , at the same time they had informed the employers that an appeal had already been launched and that any unfavourable results would lead to an additional appeal , during the course of which the data and results would have to be discussed , thereby laying any anomaly open to public scrutiny .  
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
The macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programmes of a wide range of least developed countries had not been successful during the first half of the current decade owing to an overall unfavourable external environment .  
The baseless accusations that have been made , including the alleged capturing of Yemeni fishermen by the Eritrean Government ; that Eritrea is being used by external forces ; and other similar inflammatory and irresponsible statements will only derail the issue into a perilous path , rendering a timely solution elusive .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
A number of societies are seriously threatened by increasing external debt , the instability of the international financial system , persistent unemployment , intractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of crime and corruption .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
The commitment that we undertook at the 1990 World Summit therefore represented a challenge that we had to accept in extremely difficult circumstances , since we entered the decade in the midst of a deep economic crisis with reduced resources , an oppressive external debt and great demands and needs for social services .  
With regard to Africa , the report states that it is the only region in which the total external debt is greater than the gross national product and that low economic growth and insufficient public resources are such that they have had negative implications for children .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
As a country that has suffered under the heavy burden of external debt and the ensuing social and economic hardships resulting from structural adjustment , Jamaica is fully aware of the difficulties currently being confronted by our sister nations on the African continent .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
The overwhelming burden of external debt , excessive dependence on a few commodities , rapid population growth , serious deterioration of nutritional indicators , environmental degradation with the recurring problems of drought and desertification social tensions and ongoing conflicts reveal only part of the grave consequences of increasing marginalization of African countries from the world economy .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
At the two previous sessions of the General Assembly , we pointed out that the lack of visible signs of understanding and tangible measures on the part of the developed nations in assisting the new and restored democracies could be interpreted as an unfavourable external factor and have serious consequences for both national harmony and regional stability .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
In both Declarations , the international community recognized that no State has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other State , and that no State may use or encourage the use of economic , political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights or to secure from it advantages of any kind .  
Today , at a time when the reform of the system is the subject of such intense discussion , our national experience may perhaps be useful , as it is an example of cooperation that is at once respectful and dynamic , based fundamentally on internal efforts with appropriate external help .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
The difficulties many LDCs have in meeting their external obligations , in the context of the critical current economic situation and their poor export performance , is reflected in the relatively low levels of debt service paid in relation to scheduled payments .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action 1 / and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
" Run out " ( out-of-true-running ) : radial displacement in one revolution of the main spindle measured in a plane perpendicular to the spindle axis at a point on the external or internal revolving surface to be tested ( reference : " ISO " 230 Part 1-1986 , para .  NULL  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
On the one hand , Argentina , Mexico and , to some extent , Uruguay had to manage their economic policies in a climate marked by a sharp contraction of external financing , in which they faced severe slumps in domestic demand , with adverse effects on output and fiscal revenues .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
Economic reform and structural adjustment programmes designed to correct internal and external imbalances as well as to enhance efficiency and productivity , which are particularly essential in a rapidly globalizing world economy , continued to be implemented in most countries in the ESCWA region in 1995 . 
A second objective will be to increase awareness of the changing nature , volume and direction of international financial flows , propose ways and means to enhance and stabilize both official and private finance , monitor changes in the external debt situation and identify innovative approaches and strategies to resolve the difficulties of countries with debt-servicing problems ;  
To increase Governments ' understanding of the main internal and external problems and obstacles impeding the development of foreign trade and foreign direct investments in the ECE region and the implications for these areas of implementing the Uruguay Round decisions by the beginning of the twenty-first century with a view to contributing to the adoption of policies facilitating and promoting intraregional trade and investment cooperation ;  
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
The meeting invited interested developing countries and donor Governments and multilateral organizations to review policy frameworks , plans of action and basic social services programmes , with identified national and external financing requirements , in all appropriate forums , in particular consultative group and round-table meetings .  
The Executive Board also decided that the allocation of resources should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the actual needs and requirements of countries , and should take fully into consideration coherent national programmes , plans and strategies on population and development and the need for external resources to complement national financial efforts in the area of population and development ; and endorsed the procedure for categorization of countries into three groups as outlined in the report and approved the relative shares of resources among them .  
Economic development and cooperation , documents were issued on the annual survey of economic and social developments in the ESCWA region , 1994 ; stock markets in the ESCWA region ; developments and issues in the external trade and payments situation of countries of Western Asia ; developments and trends in the monetary and financial sectors ; revitalization of research and development activities in selected countries of the ESCWA region ; and techno-economic aspects of the application of new materials in the ESCWA region .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .  
UNDP has defined the conditions for success to include : objectives established and communicated ; internal and external risks identified and assessed ; policies established , communicated and practised ; and measurable performance targets and indicators included in objectives and plans .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
The preparation of such a diagnostic framework would enable each country to undertake its own analysis of the conditions specific to it ; it would allow a wide range of national factors to be taken into account , particularly the interaction of different sectoral policies , and a nation 's international obligations ; and it would draw attention , where appropriate , to those circumstances in which global or external influences were important as driving forces of change . 
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
Hope was expressed that a solution will be found as the World Bank and IMF continue their joint and ongoing efforts to bring the external debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries , including multilateral debt , to a sustainable level .  
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
International strategies of cooperation and coordination are outlined in the Habitat Agenda , chapter IV , section E . The main strategic objectives and activities presented in that section cover the establishment of an international enabling environment ; issues of international finance , external debt and trade ; the promotion of the transfer of technology and exchange of information ; and the provision of support to technical and institutional cooperation .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
Funding of humanitarian projects ; ( ii ) capacity-building ; ( iii ) internal and external training programmes ; ( iv ) creation of a conducive atmosphere for cooperation with international NGOs and United Nations agencies .  
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
Requests the Executive Director to arrange an overall independent and external evaluation of the global contraceptive commodity programme at a time to be decided by the Executive Board , particularly with regard to its impact on national capacity-building in order to provide the Board with the information required to make a decision on whether the programme should be continued or ended .  
On that occasion the General Assembly responded to drastic changes that are rapidly transforming the role and scope of government in the economy and society : the globalization of the economy , democratization , environmental pressures , corruption , national fiscal and external deficits , pressures for social justice , the information revolution and the emergence of civil society as an alternative supplier of a range of public services .  
Given that Mozambique takes off from an extremely low economic base and after factoring in population increases , the prevalence of the recent trend of lacklustre growth performance would translate into GDP per capita increases too modest to make a visible contribution to , and to sustain , the goals of poverty reduction , social sector development , reconstruction and restoration of external viability .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
Lastly , the pay-offs through greater mutual understanding and confidence gained in subregional economic cooperation and factor mobility may be intangible , but they generate substantial positive , highly visible and collective external benefits for ED , networking and integration among the collaborating or participating countries in the long run .  
The task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled " Macroeconomic policy questions " ;  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
In the context of ending 35 years of armed conflict , it emphasizes in particular the need to overhaul the security functions of the State : under a reformed Constitution , the police are to be restructured , strengthened and consolidated in a new National Civil Police , which will assume responsibility for internal security ; intelligence gathering activities are to be reorganized and regulated ; and the army will limit its role to external defence and will adjust its doctrine , training , deployment , size and budget accordingly .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
In accordance with United Nations Administrative Tribunal jurisprudence , the consolidated measures set out in administrative instruction ST / AI / 412 specified that a woman candidate , whether internal or external , should be given preference only when her qualifications met all the requirements for the vacant post and when her qualifications were substantially equal or superior to those of competing male candidates ( para .  NULL  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
" Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the need for the Secretary-General to monitor closely the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative on multilateral debts , so that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session is ably guided in its deliberations on the sub-item on the external debt crisis and development to be included in the provisional agenda of that session of the Assembly , under the item entitled ' Macroeconomic policy questions ' ;  
At the end of the first preambular paragraph , the words " other relevant international agreements concerning international cooperation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries " were replaced with the words " the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summit meetings held since the beginning of the 1990s " ;  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
The main objectives of the Andean Community are to promote the balanced and harmonious development of the member countries on an equal basis through integration and economic and social cooperation ; to accelerate economic and social growth and generate employment ; to reduce vulnerability to external factors and to improve the position of member countries in the global economic context ; and to strengthen subregional solidarity and reduce differences in existing levels of development among its members .  
With the successful conclusion of the military observer Mission in Guatemala , the definitive ceasefire between the Government and the URNG has established the necessary conditions for the promotion of peace and development in a subregion of the Americas which has been particularly vulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and external interference .  
Unfortunately , in our world there remain conflicts , violence , ethnic strife , religious intolerance , terrorism , drug trafficking , corruption , poverty , unjust international economic relations and a heavy external debt that continues to prove overwhelming .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
It is recognized , however , that the responsibility for coordinating external assistance , from multilateral , bilateral or other international organizations , rests first and foremost with the Government concerned .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
The development of future large water-supply systems must adopt pricing that reflects all external costs , including waterlogging ; salinization ; habitat alteration ; impact on endangered species ; long-term deterioration of water quality due to changing land-use practices in catchment areas ; cultural and social dislocation ; and the cost of imposed risks .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers .  
As they moved along the path of reform , their objectives became more complex and ambitious , shifting from the limited concerns of macroeconomic imbalances and stabilization to the promotion of development by a plethora of market-oriented reforms , including the improvement of economic efficiency , curbing of public sector intervention , encouragement of the private sector and liberalization of the external trade sector .  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
The granting of preferential access to external markets , through bilateral , regional and international agreements , would greatly enhance the investment promotion efforts of developing countries , particularly smaller economies , as a minimum market size is an important prerequisite for many investors .  
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
We undertake to continue to coordinate our positions on these issues in regional and international forums and to contribute to the work of the United Nations Decade of International Law with the goal of intensifying the analysis of the question of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national laws , strengthening multilateralism through the application of the international agreements signed by States and guiding the external conduct of our countries on the basis of international law .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .

However , even with sufficient resources , the initiative 's main goal of reaching external debt sustainability would be unattainable unless a favourable international economic climate were created to provide open access to markets , modern technologies and sources of development financing .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
The annex makes reference to the identification by the Panel of numerous practical disadvantages to independent audits and management reviews by individual Member States and to the fact that the Financial Regulations of the United Nations stipulate that the external auditors appointed by the organizations ' governing bodies are solely responsible for the conduct of audits .  
These are aggravated by , inter alia : stifling external indebtedness ; a continued deterioration of the terms of trade ; an alarming decline in official development assistance ; and an equally worrying reduction of international cooperation for development in general .  
However , if one were to consider these few achievements against the background of an extremely fragile economy deprived of natural resources , and a high dependency on tourism and fisheries both of which are susceptible to global economic change and environmental and other external factors the whole scenario could easily change from a happy and promising one to an obscure and insecure one .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
On the one hand and thanks to the praiseworthy support of the Organization of African Unity , the League of Arab States , the French Republic and the assistance of the international community its goal was to lay the foundations for the reconstruction of a country that has for so long been buffeted by numerous acts of external aggression that have engendered enormous economic and financial difficulties that have significantly hampered its development . 
There is a need for better designed projects at the national level , with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and economic performance , together with policies aimed at creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment ( internal and external ) and donor support .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
The problem remained unsolved until external factors triggered spiralling resentment that was exploited by the elements concerned : the arrival of the Rwandan refugees in 1994 and its consequences , namely , imported violence , the international protection extended even to those guilty of genocide , environmental damage and the preferential treatment of refugees fed latent anti-Rwandan feelings . 
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
The Russian cosmonauts performed five space walks , during which they succeeded in mounting a new telescopic loading boom on the external surface of the station , together with supplementary scientific instrumentation , and also transferred fresh a solar array , fitted with United States photoelectric elements , from the docking unit to the Kvant astrophysics module .  
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas . 
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .  
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
The remark was made that the task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
Constraints to external communication and public affairs identified through the change management exercise were : ( a ) unclear policy messages in written and oral communications , which are frequently jargon-ridden and lacking in hard facts ; ( b ) uneven collaboration between DPA and line units ; ( c ) a media-shy culture in UNDP as a whole ; and ( d ) insufficient financial investment in communication .  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
While the mobilization of external resources should target and tap into the growing non-debt-creating arrangements and particularly direct foreign investment ( FDI ) , the domestic counterpart should seek to exploit the rich potential within both the urban and rural milieus .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
Moreover , the major donors stated in 1995 that the role of external partners is to help strengthen capacities in developing partner countries , and that the dominant conception of the mission of development assistance is to help countries and societies to strengthen their economic , human , social and institutional capacities for self-sustaining development .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers . on service providers . 
This exercise involved extensive external and internal consultations throughout 1994 and 1995 and culminated in the introduction in January 1996 of a modified organizational structure consisting essentially of redefined divisional responsibilities and the creation of a Corporate Strategy and Quality Assurance Section to facilitate a corporate approach to the delivery of services .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
Without an effort of that scope and significance , and without a solution to such fundamental problems as the external debt of the African countries , the vast majority of those countries would be unable to overcome the difficulties arising from their current critical economic situation and the accumulation of serious social problems caused by marginalization .  
With regard to the external debt , the initiatives taken by the Bretton Woods institutions and creditor countries to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and to find solutions to multilateral debt were insufficient and of limited scope , and the situation of middle-income countries which met their obligations promptly and in full was likewise unresolved ; hence a comprehensive and radical solution to the debt problem must be found .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  7A . 8 During the biennium the following activities will be undertaken :  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries . 
Although Nicaragua had been able to make progress in solving the problem of the external debt , through the cooperation of the international community and friendly countries , such as the Russian Federation , which had recently announced the cancellation of the debt balance , the external debt was still a very heavy burden which impeded economic growth and inhibited public and private investment .  
While the economic reform and political stability programmes had re-established confidence in the country , Cambodia still needed a considerable volume of external assistance especially in the areas of budget support , administrative reform , mine clearance , resettlement and reintegration , agriculture , social services , the maintenance of public utility services and the rehabilitation of transport systems and infrastructure .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
In order to achieve those objectives , it was necessary to establish a modern legal framework in order to protect intellectual property and attract external resources for productive investment and , lastly , to ensure the participation of civil society and the integration of society with a view to harmonious and balanced development .  
In order to be operational , however , such a global model should comprise large-scale national models that should be designed to cover domestic economy , external sector and supply-side response to external shocks such as coercive economic measures .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
In 1989 , in cooperation with the World Bank , Jordan had elaborated a comprehensive economic reform programme designed to curb inflation , reduce the growing external debt and stop the decline in the gross domestic product .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
The arsenals accumulated by some of the most repressive regimes in Africa in previous decades , with either ostensible or covert support from external Powers , had particularly deleterious consequences that stretched well into the nineties .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
There is growing recognition of the essential linkages between all aspects of external support for countries afflicted by conflict , whether political , humanitarian , developmental or human rights .  
In the efforts to find a fair and effective solution to the external debt crisis , a differential approach , based on the special problems of each individual State , should be applied .  
Poverty was particularly severe on the African continent , which experienced a wide variety of epidemic and endemic diseases , a very low literacy rate , hunger and malnutrition and heavy external debt .  
He remarked that urgent measures should be taken to erase the external debts of the developing countries , many of which were so crippled by debt servicing that they were unable to provide basic economic and social services .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .  
To the extent that globalization has enabled some countries to attract external investment leading to accelerated economic growth and thus an expanded revenue base , it has had a potentially positive impact on social provision .  
One was to reject everything that was foreign , on the reasoning that each countrys situation was unique and that external influences tended to be irrelevant at best or to undermine local uniqueness and cultural identity at worst .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The high level of unhedged private external debt made the option of devaluing the baht a painful choice that was avoided until foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted in defending the exchange rate .  
We appeal to the international community for support for the internal partnership for peace a precondition for the external initiative .  Burundi must no longer be treated in an infantile , unjust , and inequitable manner .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The representative of Cuba said that orthodox liberalization and deregulation policies had been catastrophic for the East Asian economies , which were as vulnerable to external factors as they were attractive for international capital flows . 
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .

The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
As reported in this year 's Trade and Development Report , there is ample evidence to show that Africa 's external debt burden is in fact having a severe adverse effect on both public and private investment and renewed growth .  
And as FAO has noted , the complex array of internal and external pressures acting on the fisheries sector call for responsible , timely , coordinated and comprehensive responses by national fishery administrations and regional fishery bodies if governance is to be strengthened .  
With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
Concerning external debt , the agreed formulations on problems relating to debt workouts by countries hit by financial crisis and on the slow progress in the implementation of the World Bank / IMF HIPC initiative represented a significant advance in international consensus on the subject .  
Generally speaking , however , the current extent and types of protected areas , particularly in densely populated regions , are deemed insufficient to achieve sustainable forest management due to both internal and external factors .  
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .  
The Greek Cypriot administration , which tries to present itself as the champion of conservation of cultural heritage , continues , on the one hand , to show utter contempt for what is left of the Turkish-Islamic heritage in South Cyprus , where Ottoman Turkish shrines are under threat of disintegration due to total neglect , and , on the other hand , systematically blocks the flow of any external financial or technical assistance to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for conservation purposes .  
However , their prospects for sustained economic growth and development continued to be dampened by their increased vulnerability to the unfavourable external economic environment , a situation that was even more critical for the least developed countries .  
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
At the same meeting , I reminded the Foreign Minister that the Group of Experts had carefully considered the feasibility of a national tribunal , but concluded that the Cambodian judiciary in its current state was unlikely to meet minimal international standards of justice , even with external assistance .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
Since Africa continued to suffer from a heavy external debt burden that contributed to the increase in poverty and affected the political and social sectors , SADC reiterated its call for urgent , effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the problems of external debt and debt servicing in the developing countries .  
In collaboration with appropriate United Nations and external partners , the subprogramme will alert the world to emerging problems by initiating periodic assessments of priority environmental issues , strengthening linkages to global and national environmental observation programmes and helping to provide authoritative information for policy formulation and implementation . 
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
Some countries have included goals and policies based on those adopted at the Summit in national strategies ; others have introduced new approaches to policy development , have renewed or maintained existing institutions or have sought additional external support . 
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Refrain from any interference , direct or indirect , individual or collective , in internal and external affairs falling within the national competence of individual States , regardless of their mutual relations , and that they shall refrain from any form of armed intervention or threat with armed intervention against another member State , as well as from undertaking political economic or other coercion ;  
Finally , he wished to stress the importance of maintaining the separate and distinct roles of internal and external oversight bodies as well as the need for oversight services not to duplicate their activities and to liaise closely in order to ensure smooth and efficient coverage of the organizations concerned .  
Other areas of UNICEF action include increasing internal and external resources to water and environmental sanitation programmes at the country and regional level , advocating the commitment of higher resources to the sector , promoting subregional collaboration among countries and working to help reach the un-served by expanding coverage through participatory community-based approaches and supporting innovative financing mechanisms for sustainability and equity .  
Lessons identified through the two independent internal and external assessments of the UNDAF pilot phase and the policy guidance provided in General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , as well as comments by agencies of the United Nations system , formed the basis for the revision of the UNDAF guidelines and shaped the modalities for the gradual extension of the UNDAF exercise to other countries , approved in April 1999 .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
The discussion focused on six main subjects : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiatives ; and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
Translation of commitment to the goals of the Conference into commensurate levels of donor funding has not been forthcoming , and there is an urgent need for donor countries to renew and intensify efforts to meet the need for complementary external resources required to implement the costed elements of the Programme of Action , that is : ( in 1993 United States dollars ) $ 5.7-billion in 2000 , $ 6.1-billion in 2005 , $ 6.8 billion in 2010 and $ 7.2-billion in 2015 .

The country 's narrow economic base , with tourism and fisheries contributing about 40 per cent of the gross domestic product , leaves the country excessively vulnerable to external shocks .  
The external circumstances that also impose challenges include the prospect of low prices for bananas , dwindling development assistance in the form of grants from traditional donors , stringent conditions on multilateral loan funding and increasing competition on the international market as a result of the trends towards globalization in all its aspects .  
In this respect , a negative role is played by , among other factors , the country 's particular economic structure inherited from the former Soviet Union , which is incapable of meeting the requirements of a market economy ; Tajikistan 's geographic remoteness , which has a significant detrimental effect on external economic activity ; and mountainous terrain that makes a mere 7 per cent of our country suitable for human settlement .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The Directors stressed that the successful implementation of the financial programme , including the clearance of external and domestic arrears , would hinge crucially on a sustained increase in budget revenue and the timely implementation of agreed measures .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
That combination could only be created and maintained for so long because of the perverse mechanism that linked it to external markets ( in the northern states of the USA , by contrast , slavery never took a hold because the ecological conditions for export crops based on plantations were absent ) .  
The time has now come to offer , within the broad framework of the HIPC initiative , a rapid and complete writing off of external debt to those countries prepared to channel the resulting budget savings into an internationally recognized programme for expanding essential services in health and knowledge infrastructure - in particular education and training .  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
While the Committee is aware of the efforts undertaken by the State party to allocate substantial financial resources for the benefit of children , it reiterates its concern ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 24 , para . 8 ) that stringent budgetary measures and external debt , as well as the persistence of widespread poverty and uneven income distribution , are still having a negative impact on the situation of children in the State party .  
Under investment costs , the Secretary stated that the resource growth related , in the main , to the contractual requirements in respect of the advisory and custodial fees and for rental charges for the office space provided to the Investment Management Service ; the proposals under audit costs related to the Funds share of the costs for internal and external audits of its operations .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Inspections provide the High Commissioner with comprehensive and systematic assessments of UNHCR operations , focusing on those factors , both internal and external to UNHCR , considered most relevant to the effective and efficient discharge of UNHCRs responsibilities .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
By the same token , access to global markets that are expanding at a steady , sustained rate is crucial in allowing countries confronting external payment difficulties to undertake positive adjustment in the context of economic expansion rather than contraction .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The discussion focused on six main issues : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiative and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
In canton 6 , based on a full operational review of the Ministry of Interior and all municipal police administrations , UNMIBH has developed a " three-point plan " of concrete steps for the creation of a multi-ethnic , fully integrated professional police force , which is insulated from inappropriate external influences .  
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
In order to ensure that it can contribute to laying the foundations for enduring and coherent development , intensified international cooperation as well as countries = own national and collective efforts will be essential to address effectively the shortcomings of the external environment and the constraints of underdevelopment .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
In the area of the mobilization of external resources for development , the challenges ahead include the following : mobilizing enhanced and more stable sources of international investment flows towards a larger number of recipient developing countries ; strengthening international cooperation aimed at a reversal of the decline in ODA ; and finding lasting solutions to the debt problems of developing countries .  
Since my seventh report to the Council ( S / 1999 / 788 ) , events in the Central African Republic have been dominated to a large extent by the preparations for the presidential election by the Mixed and Independent Electoral Commission ( CEMI ) , which was assisted by MINURCA and various external donors , the campaign by political parties and the first round of the election , which took place on 19 September after two consecutive postponements .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Successful elements of those strategies included increasing penetration of external markets ; facilitating access to imported inputs ; creating an enabling environment ; improving universal primary education and access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology ; promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the competence of the civil service .  
As far as the external debt crisis was concerned , the Group of 77 and China welcomed the Cologne initiative and the enhanced HIPC framework which had been adopted at the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and which held out the promise of faster , deeper and broader relief ; a critical factor to its success would be the provision of adequate financing . 
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
The task force has divided its activities into two parts : on the one hand , the internal activities necessary to ensure the readiness of the International Bureau and the smooth functioning of all its essential systems during the year-end transition and , on the other hand , the external activities directed towards the postal administrations that are members of UPU .  
Ms . Wong ( Singapore ) said that as a small island State with no natural resources , her country was acutely aware of the impact on its environmental well-being of external factors , and was committed to playing a proactive role in supporting regional and global initiatives to protect the environment .  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
The Haitian National Police remains an extremely fragile institution , weakened by internal shortcomings ( administrative , disciplinary and operational ) and external pressures ( ebbing public support and an aggressive Fanmi Lavalas campaign against its leadership ) .  
In recognition of the crushing burden that external debt placed on developing nations and the resultant inability of those countries to attend to social and environmental issues , the Initiative used debt relief as an instrument for resolving many of the social and developmental problems faced by such countries .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
The problem of external debt , structural adjustment programmes , economic globalization , unequal access to commercial markets , the collapse of basic commodity prices and speculation in hard currencies are obstacles to development and are detrimental not only to the political independence of developing countries but also to their economic and development policies and their ability to forecast the evolution of their economic situation at the national and international levels .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may be either inadequate or unavailable ,  
In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
The economic weaknesses of small island developing States were well known : narrow economic base , low levels of diversification , heavy dependence on external trade ; shortage of skilled manpower ; and the brain drain .  
The new guidelines , intended for use by statistical compilers , data users and policy officials , will provide methodological standards for the compilation of statistics on external debt based on the international investment position framework and concept ; practical guidance for the compilation of these statistics ; and selected topics on the use of external debt data in the analysis of macroeconomic sustainability and external vulnerability .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
While rich countries have the transnational corporations that control over one third of all of the worlds exports , we poor countries have the asphyxiating burden of external debt , which has risen to the level of $ 2-trillion and continues to grow , devouring almost 25 per cent of our export earnings just to service our debt.How can development be possible under these conditions ? 
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
In this connection , improved terms of trade , access to international markets , increased direct foreign investments , alleviation of the external debt burden and an expanded resource base are some of the crucial issues that have to be seriously considered .  
Similarly , the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement , held at Durban in September 1998 , reiterated the Movements position , that the international community must oppose all acts of interference , external intervention and coercive economic measures and other measures , including extraterritorial laws and regulations that affect the sovereignty of States , the legitimate interests of entities and persons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and of navigation .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
The Committee considered that , since the EVI could give only a partial and approximate measure of the relative level of vulnerability of a country , a document to be called a country vulnerability profile should be prepared , for some countries , to provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of external economic and natural shocks on their economic performance and economic structure .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
National decisions and the capacity to manage land resources sustainably can also be constrained by external factors and the impacts of inappropriate development strategies pursued in the past , including unequal negotiations for rights to exploit natural resources by national and foreign companies , and poorly designed projects financed by donors which have been based on purely economic considerations .  
The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
The three-wall system is composed of a thin external layer made of aluminium spaced with an intermediate bumper made of a combination of ceramic fibres and high-strength fabric mixed with Epoxy resin ; the internal wall made of aluminium alloy is the module structure to be protected .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for further implementation in an effective , equitable and development-oriented way of existing mechanisms for the treatment of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens , and , in this context , stressing the need to agree upon equitable burden-sharing among the international public creditor community ,  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
This new Government will concentrate on implementing vigorous measures aimed at increasing State income so that the State can honour its obligations , both internal ( payment of salaries , pensions and scholarships and provision of basic social services ) and external ( particularly to the Bretton Woods institutions ) within a context of transparent management of the civil service and State enterprises . 
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
Consultations and coordination with UNCTAD , the regional commissions , IMF and the World Bank ; provision of improved global on-line access to the Project Link model for other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; and external relations with academic , governmental and non-governmental economic research institutes through the exchange of background papers and consultations .  
Also noteworthy was another triangular initiative in support of Cuba ' s economic recovery , under which expertise was transferred from Brazil , Chile and Mexico , with triangular support provided by Norway , in macroeconomic policy formulation , national budgeting , central banking accounting , treasury functions , commercial banking and external debt management .  
The analysis seems to support the conclusion that TCDC has been more successful in those countries where government has put in place explicit TCDC policy linked with national development planning process ; established a strong TCDC focal point with the necessary supporting structure ; and earmarked national budgetary allocations or devised means for innovative use of external assistance , including triangular cooperation .  
While SADC welcomed debt-relief initiatives , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt initiative , it believed that the international community should start writing off the external debt of those countries that had made visible and sustainable progress in the implementation of tough structural adjustment measures and political reforms , so that they could invest the resources thus freed up in social sectors .  
The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .  
The Commission had stressed the need for promoting increased transparency and appropriate accountability for the implementation of sound national and corporate development policies , which enhance a country ' s abilities to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and volatile flows of short-term capital . 
Access to the markets of developed countries , the reduction in the external debt of heavily indebted developing countries , together with an increase in ODA , should be the key elements of any credible international policy designed to find a lasting solution to the problem of financing for development .  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
Although , he recognized the views expressed by some Governments and academics that the right to self-determination included both an external and an internal aspect and that the latter applied to groups within existing States , he argued that there was not yet international consensus in that respect .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
With regard to the external world , the United Arab Emirates has signed a number of agreements and memorandums of understanding and arranged cultural and informational exchanges in the area of education at the bilateral , regional and international level .  
As the main determinants of transparency , environmental reports of TNCs , internal and external , voluntary and mandatory , must provide a credible portrait of their global activities .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Such factors were exacerbated by shortsighted international trade and financial practices , the unsustainable external debt burden , uncontrolled economic growth , particularly in urban areas , and the growing inequality among countries .  
United by strong natural , historic , social and cultural ties , that community would offer a single focus for investment and tourism and a single market with a common external tariff and would facilitate the free flow of goods , services and people .  
SADC was firmly resolved to reduce poverty through sustained and broadbased economic growth and equitable distribution of social services , but the enormous burden of external debt inhibited the full economic and social development of the region . 
The Territory was unique in that the shift of national power to external agents during the century or so of colonialism had had little practical impact on everyday life , for the political and cultural reality that everyone knew and understood was the village .  
However , while economic growth has remained positive on average , the rate of growth has not been sustainable because it was based on external factors such as good weather and favourable commodity prices .  
The LDCs continued to be marginalized in global economic activities , ODA had declined substantially and the external debt burden had reached alarming proportions , while foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and exports and imports had been reduced .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
In the economic sphere , specific aspects , such as internal and external financing , modern services , and variations in the value of physical and financial stocks will be considered . 
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
As a postconflict country , Liberia is still a fragile political setting , with limited internal resources , growing poverty , and dwindling external assistance , which constitute important factors militating against smooth transition .  
The underlying weakness of the social services in a number of LDCs is that they were established or instituted on the availability of external loans and grants rather than on the basis of strong , vibrant and growing domestic production and economic base .  
We are exposed to sudden external shocks , such as regional conflicts , increases in international oil prices , declines in copper prices , harsh weather patterns and financial crises .  
The Divisions main role is to ensure that UNHCR communicates a coherent , consistent and convincing message to the external environment , thereby mobilizing public , political and financial support for the work of the Office .  
The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
There was a need for financial investment , free access to markets , and improved external conditions for trade , financial and economic activities ; it was also imperative that such countries should benefit from additional official development assistance .  
Finally , he said that Governments , organizations and the entire international community must work together to create favourable internal and external conditions for gradual economic growth and successful , socially oriented sustainable growth for all States .  
What has been missing is the supportive external economic environment that has been considered critical to ensure accelerated development in developing countries .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
In response to those changes in the internal and external environment , the United Nations had elaborated a set of core values and competencies , improved human resources planning , streamlined the personnel manual and expanded the staff training program .  
While this debt may be manageable under rapid growth circumstances and in an otherwise favourable economic environment , their situation leaves them very vulnerable to abrupt changes in internal or external factors .  
To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety , international civil servants must not accept , without authorization from the executive head , any honour , decoration , gift , remuneration , favour or economic benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations ; it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and other entities .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
It consists of the need to help the people of Afghanistan establish a responsible , representative , accountable and stable Government which enjoys internal and external legitimacy ; is committed to respecting and promoting the rights of all its men , women and children ; enjoys peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbours ; and is able to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be used as a breeding and staging ground for terrorists or drug-traffickers .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
While international efforts could create conducive conditions for economic development , the primary responsibility for a nations development lay with its Government and people , and discussions on financing growth the development should focus on how to help LDCs mobilize domestic financial resources and attract external resources .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
The objectives and expected accomplishments detailed in table 27A . 8 above are expected to be achieved on the assumption that : ( a ) sufficient financial resources will be made available for maintaining adequate technical infrastructure and monitoring mechanisms ; and ( b ) programme managers will be supportive of the Oversight Support Unit efforts and extend their full cooperation in the implementation of recommendations of the external oversight bodies .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Translating and revising documents , official correspondence and publications ; providing quality control of in-house and contractual translation ; providing reference and terminology services for translators , interpreters and editors , as well as for external contractors ; outsourcing translation , editing , proof-reading , typesetting , typing and other work ; providing assistance and feedback to contractors ; coordinating the quality-control system for outsourced jobs ; maintaining , updating and expanding the roster of individual and corporate contractors ; preparing contracts ; and providing the requisite administrative data ; ( b ) Editorial services . 
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
The Unit is the only system-wide independent external oversight body , and it is accountable to the General Assembly and the competent legislative organs of the specialized agencies and other international organizations within the United Nations system that accept its statute .  
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Based on common international understandings that respect diversity and specific country circumstances , these national efforts should be supported by an enabling international environment , including good international financial and trade governance and adequate external resources mobilization .  
Others for different reasons , including domestic economic mismanagement , conflicts , natural catastrophes and external economic shocks , such as terms of trade changes , international interest rate hikes or contagion are faced with difficult or even unbearable debt burdens .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
In addition , it had found that the frequent rotation of senior managers had had a detrimental effect on key policing projects and alliances formed with external agencies and community leaders , and had determined that such managers should consequently be employed for longer periods .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
Declining availability of financial resources , domestic and external , including ODA , a heavy and unsustainable debt burden , falling or volatile commodity prices , complex trade barriers , lack of economic and export diversification and market access for key products which LDCs benefit from , as well as supply-side constraints , have seriously affected the growth and development prospects of LDCs .  
It is recognized that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals . 
To protect the poor in the short run and sustain progress already achieved towards the international development goals , Fund-supported programmes continue to include social safety nets to cushion the negative impact of economic reforms and external shocks on vulnerable groups .  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires , inter alia , a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of ODA ) , to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
Despite new measures taken to adjust course , the new Government has inherited runaway inflation , monetary instability , a persistent fiscal deficit , a very heavy external debt and a climate of great social tension .  
In implementing its interim programme , the Government thus faces a serious problem of external financing , which is essential in view of the countrys meagre domestic resources and the unresolved problem of its external debt arrears , which stands in the way of conventional official development assistance mechanisms .  
It calls for the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative on the basis of mutual agreement and commitment by donors and least developed countries , and recognizes that this initiative is important in mobilizing new and additional resources , both from domestic and from external sources , with a view to facilitating universal access to basic social services .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
Several challenges which faced the implementation of commitments and for monitoring included : the need to reverse the declining trend in the levels of external resources , including the need for a substantial increase in the UNCTAD LDCs Trust Fund ; and the need to improve the measurement tools through the strengthening of national statistical systems to generate and manage relevant data in LDCs , as recognized in the Programme of Action .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
Poverty , along with other situations of marginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the worlds people , including the denial of human dignity , the lack of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , social dislocation , intolerable refugee situations , internal and external displacement and physical and psychological oppression , are breeding grounds just waiting to be exploited by terrorists .  
However , favourable external conditions were equally necessary ; the current international economic system must be reformed to meet the challenges of globalization and growing interdependence among countries and made more equitable by increasing the decision-making power of the developing countries .  
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
First of all , an equitable international economic order should be established which did not blindly impose globalization on developing countries but instead included an equitable trading system , reform of the international financial institutions and a solution to the external debt problem .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
The new format , which was intended to reflect an approach that was more qualitative than quantitative , set forth the objectives around which each programme had been designed , as well as expected accomplishments , indicators of achievement and external factors that could affect the level of success in meeting those expectations .  
Welcomes the convening of the donor meetings for East Timor at Tokyo in December 1999 , at Lisbon in June 2000 , at Brussels in December 2000 , at Canberra in June 2001 and at Oslo in December 2001 , which focused on the national budget and the transition towards independence in East Timor in four key areas : political , public administration , public finances , and economic and social reconstruction , and urges the international community to fulfil its pledges to meet the external requirements for rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities for East Timor ;  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
The meeting noted ( a ) the importance of adopting poverty monitoring plans agreed by all stakeholders , with external assistance to promote the dialogue ; ( b ) the need for strategic statistical plans to be jointly developed by all stakeholders , including planners , civil society , donors and the international community ; and ( c ) that the generation of community-level statistics was facilitated through cost-sharing , for example , when local authorities funded the field costs of surveys in their locality .  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
In this way Bahrain criminalizes terrorist acts , and they constitute a crime against the external or internal security of the State whether the offence is committed in Bahrain or elsewhere , whether by a national or an alien and whether the person concerned is a primary perpetrator or an accessory to the crime .  
Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
The task of preparing for the arrival of external drilling contractors for the almost 400 new wells planned is an enormous one , requiring numerous access roads , earth-moving and foundation works to allow access to the incoming drilling units and to construct , repair and maintain surface facilities required to treat current and future crude oil production flows before export or refining can be undertaken .
