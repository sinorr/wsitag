The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "

Comrade Mao Zedong said during the rectification campaign in Yanan : Only when we master Marxism can our contingent be consolidated , can our cadres be enhanced in quality , and can we have the ability to meet and to have control over a future bright world .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
The department has carried out rectification and reform at a deeper level , strengthened investigation and study , closely integrated " looking back " with " looking forward , " thought of , discussed and grasped big things , paid greater attention to future work , and further enhanced its political sensitiveness and ability to distinguish political matters .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
It can create " future " wars based on the general law of development governing hi-tech wars and by taking into full consideration China 's security posture , international influence , political and geographical environment , national characteristics , and other distinct features .  
By means of virtual reality , we can transform the future into the present as the direct subject of thinking and achieve the " seamless linkage " between the past , the present , and the future in the realm of thinking .  This brings the mode of thinking more in sync with the systematic , comprehensive , and multidimensional characteristics of military thinking .  
We should concentrate our manpower as well as financial and material resources on building a group of high-ranking academies and universities that have clear-cut military characteristics .  We should give priority to supporting a group of academic departments and laboratories that have utmost bearing on future wars .  These academic departments and laboratories will play a role as an initiator and demonstrator for all military academies .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .

Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
In the light of the characteristics that the new ground-to-air missiles are mobile and have quick flying speed and strong low-altitude defense capacity , they have established the method of organizing the air defense brigade into " two groups and one team " to cope with future operations , and studied the combat tactics of combining the efforts to resist and fight back with the efforts to hold back and intercept the incoming aircraft .  
Bearing in mind Dandong 's key antichemical warfare work targets , the antichemical warfare detachment of the local troops conducted the exploratory drill to counter possible direct or indirect use of chemical weapons by the enemy in future warfare .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
As we look back at the narcotics control course traveled by the Chinese nation and view the changing anti-drug situation in the world , we soberly realize that the numerous social problems caused by illegal drugs are posing increasing threats to China 's economic development and social life and to the future of the Chinese nation .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .

"  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .

The new leader of the Taiwan authorities stressed that in its long-term development prospects , the Taiwan navy must have the strategic goals of being a " crack , small , and strong force " , meaning that it should advance in the following ways : First , it must focus its vision on the distant future and draw up as soon as possible its mid and long-term manpower building plans ;  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
The units involved have summed up and popularized the achievements that the army has made in scientific and technological troops training in recent years .  Through repeated attempts for improvement , innovation , and development , they have eventually solved knotty problems that have puzzled the army for a long time regarding operations under future hi-tech conditions .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .  
The meticulous strategic setup that the United States worked out in Russia 's neighboring countries was not only designed to squeeze Russia 's strategic space but also to set up in advance an effective strategic support platform to interfere in the Euro-Asian region affairs in future .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
The fishermen are skilful at operating their vessels and are familiar with sea conditions , sea routes , and the geographical conditions of harbors , thus laying a strong foundation for them to carry out their future task of participating in battles and supporting the battlefront at sea .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
They have insisted on gearing toward the need of a future war and tried to integrate the armament work in peacetime with the armament work in wartime " .  For example , a certain armored division has reorganized its repair personnel according to the current establishment system .  These repair personnel have been assigned to work in accompanying teams , advance teams , and mobile supply teams .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
The rapid and drastic development of infrastructure and basic industries have basically resolved the bottlenecked restrictions for the economic and social developments and further strengthened the momentum for long-term development in the future .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Party committees at all levels must uphold a strong sense of being responsible for the party 's cause and the military 's construction , think of the future , make long-term plans , devote prolonged effort , and be responsible to generations to come even if they themselves are only in the position for one term .  Party committees at all levels must devote meticulous , long lasting , and permanent effort to building up the foundation and to daily implementation so as to realize overall improvement through overall consolidation and pursue comprehensive implementation through comprehensive progress .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
Chen Shui-bian expressed his belief that the leaders on both sides of the strait have sufficient wisdom and creativity , and are absolutely able to find some " common ground " and consensus acceptable to both sides , so as to jointly handle the issue of " a future one China " based on " existing foundations " .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
After viewing the experimental demonstration on management of computer network security conducted by the PLA Security Committee at the Jinan Military Region and after hearing the experiences introduced by various military units , Deputy Chief of General Staff Qian Shugen emphasized that ensuring the network security is by no means a simple issue of security , but is an essential mission to prepare for " winning the war . "  He added that ensuring the network security is a key guarantee for winning the future wars , and therefore maintaining secret means " winning the wars . "  
Only thus can we avoid making subjective judgments and acting blindly .  Only by persisting in seeking truth from facts can the content of arduous struggle be unceasingly renewed , the hardworking spirit be passed on to future generations , and the banner of arduous struggle attract , amass , and inspire the people .  
In light of characteristics of a hi-tech war in future , the unit had decided to hold in an unfamiliar water area a training exercise centered on several highly difficult training topics , such as rapid camouflage on the sea , protecting itself against an enemy 's electronic jamming , countering an enemy 's hi-tech reconnaissance , and so on .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .

US President Bush recently issued a series of tough statements regarding cross-strait affairs and US support for Taiwan . In the wake of these statements , Communist China 's authoritative personages in charge of Taiwan affairs said that Communist China 's high-ranking personnel are paying close attention to the future actions on the part of the United States . If the United States continues getting involved in cross-strait affairs , Communist China might be forced to resolve the Taiwan issue ahead of its schedule by resorting to tough means .

Reviewing the course of struggle and the basic experience over the past 80 years and looking into the arduous tasks and bright future in the new century , our party should continue to stand in the forefront of the times and lead the people in marching from victory to victory .  In a word , we must always represent the development needs of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China .

The " Speech " has integrated theory with practice , and the ideal with reality ; and has expounded the dialectical relations between the maximum program and the minimum program of the party .  While unfolding before us the bright future of a communist society , he has also stressed that the realization of communism is a very long historical process of struggle , and has urged the whole party to devote continued efforts to a successful fulfillment of both the basic program and the historical tasks of the party at the present stage .  
Summing up the course of endeavor and basic experiences over 80 years , and looking to the arduous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must - - in sum - - always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
requires that the entire party membership think of danger in times of peace and keep a stronger sense of crisis , guard against arrogance and rashness , continue to work hard for implementing the party 's basic line and fulfilling the party 's historical tasks .

According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .

Over the past year since political power changed hands , however , it is most regrettable to find that the SEF has been totally frozen out , and the public can no longer see the scenes of Director Koo Chen-fu , surrounded by reporters , narrating his optimistic views on the future prospects of cross-strait relations in a mild yet firm tone . 
While celebrating the 80th anniversary of CPC founding and marching toward the future , we must , as is required by the three represents , ? closely center round the basic issue of what kind of party to build and how under the new historical conditions and closely grasp the two major historic subjects of enhancing the party abilities of administration and art of leadership and resisting corruption , guarding against degeneration and warding off risks , and push party building to a new stage .

This kind of powerful strategic goal , together with the relatively rigid policy of President-elect George W .

Our military has put in place defense and relevant security measures on the offshore islands .  Having inferred possible scenarios , the MND has concluded that there is no need to adjust the military strength on the offshore islands in the near future .

In negotiating with the Guangdong Authority for an agreement on future water supply , the Hong Kong Government will carefully review the annual supply quantities according to the latest estimate of our freshwater demand .  We will also seek to incorporate more flexible provisions into the agreement so that the quantities of raw water imported may be reduced in wet seasons and suitably increased in dry seasons .  
" The Steering Committee has accepted that the proposed major arts and cultural facilities should be of world class standard , should complement existing and future cultural facilities in Hong Kong and should be based broadly on the conceptual plan submitted by the team led by Foster and Partners , " he said .  
Ladies and gentlemen , I have enormous faith in our future .  That confidence is not based on wishful thinking .  It 's based on what I have just outlined - a clear understanding of our positioning , and a whole range of initiatives coming on stream over the next few years .  
" With the help of dedicated health care professionals who have treated and cared for SARS patients and relentless researchers who have been engaged in identifying and understanding the virus and nature of the disease , 1,255 patients out of a total of 1,724 recovered and were discharged .  We expect more discharges in the future , " he said .  
A proper understanding of the existing law , and of the changes proposed by the Administration will , I believe , demonstrate that there is no cause to fear that human rights will be eroded , that the legislation will have a " chilling effect " on the media , that June 4 protests will be banned in the future , and so on . 
With such result and not least the tremendous effect by a very competent local staff , there is no doubt we took the right decision to set up our regional base in Hong Kong and we will continue to expand here in the coming future . " 
Comprising 11 international , mainland and local experts , the committee was appointed by the Chief Executive to carry out a detailed and expert study into the SARS outbreak , and to make recommendations on areas of improvement so that Hong Kong 's public health system could be better prepared in the future for a possible resurgence of SARS and other infectious diseases .  
The SARS Expert Committee , comprising 11 international , mainland and local experts , was appointed by the Chief Executive on May 28 , 2003 to carry out a comprehensive and expert study into the SARS outbreak earlier in Hong Kong , and to make recommendations on areas of improvement so that Hong Kong 's public health system could be better prepared in the future for a possible return of SARS or other infectious diseases .  
The Committee with 11 renowned experts from the UK , US , Australia , Mainland China and Hong Kong selected for their wide range of relevant experience was set up on May 28 .  It was tasked to conduct a review on the management and control of the epidemic and identify lessons to be learned to better prepare Hong Kong for any future outbreaks .

Full of enthusiasm , the people are prepared to work for a brighter future .  It also demonstrates that the nation 's grand objective to scale new heights can be achieved . "  
In this era of globalisation , as the world 's freest economy and a premier international finance , shipping and business centre , Hong Kong maintains constant exchanges with other economies and major cities around the world .  Many of these have become our steadfast business partners .  These global connections are crucial to Hong Kong 's future .  We must push ahead in this direction to reinforce our global market network .  
Eighty per cent of Taiwan 's highway traffic is concentrated on the long western plain . The existing west coast highway , which carries 80% of the north-south bound traffic , will not be able to meet the demands of future transportation and of balanced economic development .  
Love for learning is a proud tradition as well as a powerful motive force responsible for the rapid growth of our publishing industry . With close cooperation between the publishing and printing industries and whole-hearted support for each other , cultural and educational circles of the Republic of China look to an encouraging future . It can be foretold that , the publishers will turn out more and better books for the knowledge-hungry population .  
During the eight years after she moved with the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan , she was the principal of the primary school affiliated to the Taiwan Provincial Hsinchu Junior Teachers ' College , and set the future direction for physical and mental hygiene education for primary school children .  
From initial eagerness to break the barriers of the past , to a falling away from the associations as success came to the individuals who composed them , to the nostalgic exhibition held this year in Taipei , the early forerunners of modern art in Taiwan showed that despite changing circumstances , they still hold a deep interest in remembering the past and encouraging young artists towards the future .

Limited land and natural resources creates real problems for directing future industrial development of the nation 's economy . This , however , is offset by a fabulous pool of human resources reflected in a highly educated population and proportionally high percentage of skilled engineers .  
Taiwan has graduated from the labor intensive , living-room factory economy to the sophisticated economy of capital intensive industries , computer components and massive investment in R &amp; D . Industry and government realized that in order to maintain profit margins in this new and highly competitive environment , Management Science would have to assume a greater role in directing the development of Taiwan 's economic future .  
A city with a diverse and rich history finds itself regaining some of its former grandeur and majesty . The road will not be easy for Chang Hua and her 200,000 inhabitants , but the new mayor is determined to bring back the past in order to enter the future . Chang Hua is situated in the central part of Taiwan where traditions change slowly , matching the pace of life there .  
Below the stage stand a crowd of older people , chewing on betel nuts . These patrons of puppet theatre are joined by the four puppet troupes left in Taiwan , who abandon their traditional competitive stance to come together and view the play . Professors and others concerned about the future of folk art as well as reporters and photographers with flash cameras are on the scene .  
Independent , decisive , and energetic in their careers , and in personal relationships caring , understanding , and tolerant - - people combining these traits , be they women or men , will adapt best to the changing society of the future .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
The frequency of its light waves was orderly , and could be projected in a straight line until it was collected by a lens . It finally paved the way for a bright future for optic communication .  
The technology involved in making optical fiber cables is rather developed and can be employed commercially on a mass production basis , but scientists are still hard at work day and night working to create a highly advanced technology for the future . (  
There have been evident achievements over the last thirty years enabling traditional thought to compete on good terms with the current of practical thinking , which gives hope that it will be able to become the leading current in the future .  
Today there is yet another " transitional period , " which calls for yet again undertaking deep examination - - only by balancing the wisdom accumulated over time with the flourishing development of material culture from the West can we assure a peaceful and prosperous future for mankind .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
It does the last because it allows ROC citizens to practically comprehend the mainland , and allows the country 's future to be decided by open discussion ; in this way there slowly takes shape a consensus . Given Taiwan 's objective and subjective conditions , there is no way to accept either reunification under Chinese communist rule or absolute independence . It is necessary to undertake , under the current structure , maximum democratization internally and moderate , cautious exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , to achieve the objective of peaceful evolution .  
For us " China fever " raises a number of interesting questions . From the land of marvels described by Marco Polo , through the utopia pictured by philosophers of the Enlightenment and the Sick Man of Asia coveted by imperialists , to the future world power predicted by Arnold Toynbee , just what attitudes have Westerners held toward this ancient country isolated by oceans on one side and forbidding plains on the other ? And why ? The Western Powers removed many cultural treasures from the country during the course of the nineteenth century .  
A : I only focus on how to do the job that I am doing at the current time . I have never considered the problem of future office . Because I personally believe that the Kuomintang has many talented people , the Kuomintang should select someone of accomplishment and moral fortitude to serve as the president 's main assistant .  
Under present circumstances , some areas can not be reported to you yet but there is one point that we should understand concerning the future development of the countries , centered around the newly industrialized countries . Viewed from the perspective of economic development , it is an undeniable fact that the center of the entire economy of the Pacific region has slowly shifted from the United States to the Western Pacific region , and the potential for the future development of economic power in this region is , in fact , fairly large .  
Thus , the three major government planning departments should use an integrated method for a long-term plan and not only use economic planning to cope with future social change . Only then can there be a " social miracle " to create a true People 's Livelihood " welfare state . " ( 2 ) A planning law should be established and interchange between planning personnel and line agencies strengthened .  
Wang served with Yin Chung-jung , K . T . Li , Chao Yao-tung , and other famous leading figures in the world of economics and finance . He can rely on a rich background and thirty years ' training at mediating views to handle the coordination and communications among the various economic and financial ministries . This will enable Premier Lee to focus on mapping out the nation 's political and economic future .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
Mr . Chien said the government has stressed economic development in the past , and neglected cultural and social construction . , In the future it will try to compensate , and looks forward to achieving the following indicators by the year 2000 : * Price increases will not exceed 3.5% annually ; * The economic growth rate will reach 6.5% annually ; * Per capita GNP will reach US $ 20,000 ; * Trade volume will reach US $ 350 billion .  
The formation of regional economic organizations that is now in the ascendant will certainly create trade barriers , deepening the intensity of competition . - - The effect of newly industrialized countries entering the international trade battlefield with their rich forces in the future can not be overlooked . - - The foreign debt of the Third World continues to grow , forming another variable that is deeply troubling to all countries of the world .  
ConclusionThe four major programs and eleven key areas reported on above are the most salient of the government 's current administrative plans , aimed in essence at outlining a blueprint for future national development , and I hope you will be unsparing in your criticism and suggestions with regard to any points that may be inappropriate .  
Once public consciousness has been raised to a new level , then hand-in-hand , with heads held high and chests thrust forward , all the citizens of China can join in the march to the future . Before making his oral report on administration to the Executive Yuan , premier Lee Huan instructed the Government Information Office to edit a report entitled " So Proudly We Hail ! Salute to the 21st Century " . A copy of the report was given to each legislator at the time of the administrative report . .  
In recent years it has become the custom to erect museums , galleries , and exhibition halls through private subsidy and ownership as opposed to setting up state-run facilities . Bands , dance troupes , orchestras , and puppet shows will continue to spring up and flourish at an astonishing pace . A prominent feature of our program for the future is the construction of libraries and audio-visual centers for every township and every rural district or village .  
Development of National EducationOur educational system has endowed the general public with the ancient Greek ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body . This has produced a source of efficient manpower , and it points out the future direction which national education should take .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
Currently , the government has already ordered that the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion be terminated . In the foreseeable future , cases involving the two sides will develop in the direction of " private international law . " That is , Taiwan and the mainland will be treated as two separate " legal jurisdictions " and the concepts for dealing with " conflicts of law between two jurisdictions " will be employed .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired . The discussion revolved around living in a foreign land , coming to terms with the new land and the old , where the future of China was headed and so forth . Everyone talked in full confidence , unable to stop , and the seminar did n't break up until one o'clock at night .  
After a bleak period lasting some years radio is back on its feet again , and facing the future with renewed optimism . Television is the chief adversary of radio among the broadcast media , but surveys reveal that the most popular radio presenter over the last two years has been Lo Hsiao-yun , whose program Intimate Listening airs six evenings a week from eight to ten o'clock - - which happens to be television 's prime time .  
In other words , the elderly lack a sense of security about the future and do n't want to wait idly for death , so they need another stage on which to play out the remainder of their lives . " Hsieh Tseng Fang-lan believes services of this kind have a promising future , and the response from outside has been most gratifying . The manpower bank has yet to be officially registered but enquiries are pouring in , with a need for services ranging from technical advisers for refrigeration and air-conditioning to electricity meter readers .  
Ever since the early days Li has relied on a makeshift approach , surviving from one show to the next with profits serving as funding for the following production . In this way the company has put together eighteen productions with over 400 individual performances , and earned a surplus of NT $ 2 million . Information about their future works that appears in the program notes also indicates how well they plan the year in advance .  
" Opposition from the minority engaged in fisheries was understandable , " says Lin Chong-min , engineer with the firm of consultants , " but otherwise the project involved no appropriation of private holdings and no removal of people 's homes . Also there would be no pollution from the project after its completion , and in the future it could even bring a boom to the area . Yet most respondents neither supported nor were opposed to the plan . "  
The main difference between the two blueprints is that Kaohsiung City Government , which is the landlord and is carrying out the initial sea reclamation work , hopes to find a new face for the city in the new land , and is wary of letting it fall into the hands of outsiders . The Ministry of Communications , however , which operates the international port at the same location and is responsible for overall future on-site development , emphasizes the national interest and sees the new territory in terms of energy resources and transportation infrastructure .  
Huang Wen-po has other ideas : " No matter whether the artistic status is crude or refined , these new style chen-t'ou are all products of a given era , have social significance , and deserve to be recorded . As for whether they can survive in the future , that 's for the market to decide . " He continues , " These type of chen-t'ou are refreshing , and at the very least are lots of fun , so there 's no point in attacking them . "  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
" When the current eight secondgeneration warships are completed , we will have the capability for independently designed and produced large-scale warships , which in the future can be sold abroad , " explains a high ranking officer from the naval construction development center , indicating confidence in the project scheduling .  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed . So there are many areas where the military authorities and local government will have to work together in the future .  
Q . Some People are worried that with the use of cheap and abundant mainland labor , some of our labor-intensive industries will transfer investment and set up factories on the mainland which could influence the speed of our own industrial upgrading . They are also worried that when the mainland has absorbed our technology and capital , in the future they can turn around and destroy Taiwan 's native industries . What is your view ?  
But the detailed contents - - whether or not in the future an agency specially responsible for foreign aid will be established , exactly what the foreign aid ratio should be , whether diplomatic or economic considerations should be predominant - - have not yet been determined .  
From Peachwood Charms to New Year 's Scrolls : Ever since ancient times , everybody from high officials to lowly peddlers has used these scrolls to display their literary proficiency or express their yearnings for the future . The joyous red-scribed scrolls , their contents ranging across the spectrum of hopes and propitious wishes , never fail to get the spring season off to a rousing start .  
One unmarried social worker is worried that if she marries , it will affect her current employment . Another is worried about the problem of educating her children in the future , and keeps putting off getting married . Yet another , a single woman who owns an interior design business , quite frankly sticks to a philosophy of remaining single as a way to reduce the responsibilities of housework , " states the Cheng-Liao study .  
He satirizes feminine pettiness and cupidity , but he 's afraid to get into other areas . Playing the opposite sex is even tougher to bring off since guardians of public morality keep a close watch on the airwaves , and audiences are growing a little tired of it from overuse , what with Auntie Tung , Sister Wai , Old Lady Yang , and so forth , on practically every show . Hsiao Tung will gradually " recover his manhood " in the future , Pai Mei-hung reveals .  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
Planning has been completed on a second science-based industrial park , designed to be a future stronghold of high-tech industry . The Ministry of Economic Affairs is promoting the development of 64 promising key technologies such as liquid crystal displays and compact disk drives .  
It 's a new field , developed only five or six years ago , where we are n't that far behind other countries and where there are wide prospects for future applications . Although some scholars are worried they wo n't fit in with other industries , " high-temperature superconductors do n't require a huge investment , and as long as we keep at it , there 's a good chance we can hold our own with any other country , " Hsu Shiang-kueen says .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
This was a time of deep reflection . When I looked at things in worldly terms , it seemed that I lacked nothing . From a happy home , I had no problems with my studies , and in appearance and ability I was no worse off than most other people . It seemed that my future was clear cut - - start a career , get married and have children and pass what would be considered to be a perfect and happy life .  
Alliance case study number four - - palmtop computers . Although the main trend for the future seems to be small , specialized R &amp; D centers belonging exclusively to a single industry , the Industrial Technology Research Institute - - which has been in a league by itself for the past nineteen years and has accumulated countless resources - - is still the center of attention .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds . His lively and fine depictions of Chinese birds and their habitats has led many people , including some ecologists , to exclaim : " The Chinese have not been good at giving realistic renderings of birds and their habitats , which is something they should strive hard to do in the future . "  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
On the one hand he hoped that his eldest daughter , who once dyed her hair purple and even planned to get herself tattooed , would start acting less like a foreigner and more like a Chinese ; but more importantly , over the last decade the North American economy had been going steadily downhill , while Taiwan had been developing far better than he had ever expected , and with family and contacts here , he thought that if his children returned they would have better chances for the future .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
Seeking for strong potential : According to data from the Directorate-General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics , Executive Yuan , the proportion of over-65s in the Taiwan region will reach 7.1 percent next year , meaning that the ROC meets the United Nations definition for an elderly society . The future will inevitably bring an increase in rates of chronic disease , and transdermal patches can provide a more effective , simpler means of medical treatment . "  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
In order to gain a more prosperous future , Buhe applied at his research institute last September for a sabbatical leave of one year . He is looking into starting a partnership with his friend exporting steel , hoping to make a little extra money to secure his future life . Naturally , because of the toils of hard work , he has not had time to practice his music .  
Give future scholars opportunities to do research , " One enjoys an antique , generally speaking , by admiring fine workmanship , a well-reasoned structure , the luster and grain of beautiful wood . Is it of magnificent appearance , at once stately and full of energy ? Is the workmanship of its embellishments wise - - outstanding without overwhelming its basic shape ? Are its lines smooth and pleasing to the eye ?  
I really feel that this is unfair to the workers of the Water Conservancy Bureau . I am also greatly concerned that no scenic places will be left for our future generations . I implore the various relevant agencies to do away with their own opinions , to put aside egotistical , improper behavior , and to think more of the generations to come !  
It 's just unfortunate that no interdisciplinary study of facial tattoos was carried out in years past . A lack of pictures for future research and analysis is particularly vexing . Frustratingly , all one can do is sit and watch as respected tribal elders pass away one after another .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
When Tsai Ming-liang went up on stage on December 10 to collect his Golden Horse for best director , he said , choking with emotion , that he hoped his actors would have his good luck in the future . Back stage , he could n't hold back , crying for longer than the film 's famous lachrymose last scene . Finally , calming down and returning to his jocular self , Tsai said , " I had n't known how powerful the Golden Horse Award was , that it would make me cry for so long . "  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
Kung Peng-cheng , now a professor in the Graduate Institute of History at Chung Cheng University and tapped to be president of the future Fo Kuang University , sees part of the problem as being innate to education in a capitalist system . Students pay tuition , while professors are paid by the credit . " It 's ridiculous to ask the students to respect the teachers in a situation where knowledge is assigned a monetary value . "  
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
This is particularly because the marriage market has subtle self-regulating abilities : not only is there flexibility in the age at which people marry , but with today 's increasing numbers of divorced , remarried and single people , marriage has broken away from its traditional form , and concern that future Adams will find no Eve seems unnecessary .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
We want to guide the new generation to understand their homeland , love their country and develop a broad international perspective . Thus fortified , they can better meet international challenges and map out a bright future for their country in an increasingly competitive global village .  
Another oral history of note is that of the musician and actor Liu Chin , a member of the Taiwanese opera troupe of the legendary " Ilan Ying . " Liu 's seventy-year lifespan has essentially coincided with the rise and fall of Taiwanese opera . Because Liu was very familiar with the late Ilan Ying , through interviews with Liu the character and personality of Ilan Ying are vividly depicted , yielding valuable first - hand information for future researchers studying the history of Taiwanese opera in Ilan .  
" Assuming that the initial French recording process was in violation of the law , then all future uses of this unauthorized material , including those by Enigma and the IOC , would all be unlawful as well , " explains Huang Hsiu-lan , Difag 's attorney , in a firm tone of voice . She has received approval from Difag to use " the most intensive legal methods " to handle the case .  
While the rates of adjustment varied , they could be as high as 100% - for example , the fee for " partial liver removal " was raised from NT $ 4000-plus to NT $ 8000-plus . As for complaints by surgeons that they are " low-wage labor , " Parng states that in the future the main focus of adjustments in universal health insurance pay schedules will be on respecting doctors ' special skills .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
Far from his native place , Su looked back on his frustrated career and felt he had spent 30 years in a dream of illusory glory . On awakening he now found himself mired in the mud of human politics , his future uncertain . He felt like a fish caught on a hook , unable to swim up or down .  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
Without a degree , they ca n't become teachers . And the special coaching program has been discontinued . Many weightlifting instructors at the primary level are serving in the guise of " substitute teachers . " These primary-level teams are the training ground for " fresh troops " for the national team in the future .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
Remembering the day five years ago when Wei-wei was diagnosed as a hyperactive child by a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , Ho says , " I sat in the car and the tears just would n't stop falling , regretting the past , worrying about the future . . . . I was pained by the number of times our boy had been hit even though he was innocent . It hurt me that I had made so many wrong choices and that our son had been wrongly accused so many times .  
If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
If the scope of liberalization is too broad , problems will result . If there is total liberalization , then future owners need not actually farm the land . Given that illegal use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes is already widespread , it would be almost impossible to regulate future use at all if land need not be owned by farmers themselves . Rampant speculation , a food crisis , or other severe problems might ensue .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
Huang Chien-yi also reveals that in a future textbook edition which is still at the experimental stage , historical and mythical exemplary personages have almost disappeared , and the few remaining representative persons are all taken from daily life . The old style of teaching loyalty and filial piety by expecting children to model themselves on saints and sages is to disappear .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
This second limitation means that some 2.6 million " workers with no fixed employer " and self-employed people will be excluded from the unemployment insurance system . Their loss will be compensated by their being excused from paying the 1% of Labor Insurance contributions earmarked for unemployment insurance , and they will continue to be eligible for the existing assistance such as vocational training and new-job bonuses and loans . CLA chairman Chan Huo-sheng also promises that in the future , unemployment insurance will be gradually extended to cover these workers .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
There are still many tasks for the future . Among the feasible directions for the gay movement would be establishing an information hotline especially for gay issues , making the homosexual movement broader and more in touch with the grass roots level , coordinating groups at various levels , and developing social commentary with a uniquely gay perspective .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
In response to the global trend of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , the government is encouraging large-scale reforestation . But rapid planting of single-species forests in previously cleared areas implies that in the future , each such area will contain only one producer species , thus limiting biodiversity and creating incomplete and fragmentary food chains .  
Later , in Singapore , Chiu and Tang Shubei , vice chairman of ARATS , repeatedly emphasized the " four natures " of the Koo-Wang talks : non-governmental , economic , pragmatic , and functional . The two parties agreed to put aside relatively sensitive political issues that they disagreed on . Obviously these " four natures " referred not only to the Koo-Wang talks , but could also be seen as guiding principles for future handling of cross-strait relations by the associations .  
What concrete suggestions could be applied to future Koo-Wang talks ? This question is the subject of the third and last part of this paper . At present , the ROC National Reunification Guidelines provide the guiding principles in facing pressure from Communist China . Although they are not perfect , if their basic spirit is grasped , and they are flexibly used , I believe they can best serve the national interest of our country .  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
Ho Chun-jui continues : " There are other aspects as well , such as smashing ' the virgin complex , ' resisting domestic violence , and gay activism . Everywhere you can see that gender self-awareness does n't have to be taught , that it is flowing through society . A future in which everyone is conscious of gender issues is not only inevitable , it is to be looked forward to . "  
Tenray Chou was director of reporting at the China Times in 1979 , when Swun Yun-hsuan was ROC premier , and Taiwan 's first television show in which government officials faced the camera to explain government policy was being aired . Chou planned the show jointly with the directors of reporting for the Central Daily News and the United Daily News . Even then Chou had a dim sense that the future lay with electronic media .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Also , in the future , whole historic settlements or streets can be considered monuments to be preserved . Finally , a law governing control and treatment of rare diseases , will allow importation of appropriate medications , treatments , and essential life-saving nutritional supplements for those suffering from tens of unusual ailments .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
And he appointed Tang Fei , a member of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and a four-star general , to become premier . As a result , Chen 's standing with the public has shot upward . A Gallup poll showed that 81% of respondents were satisfied with Chen 's performance thus far , and had great hope for the future .  
On the day after his inauguration , during a visit to Kinmen , Chen pointed out that under the precondition of ensuring national security , the new government would , based on the laws of the market and the principle of reciprocal and proportional benefit , reexamine the three links . The Executive Yuan is in fact already engaged in an urgent discussion of the three links . Human rights diplomacy In the future , the government plans to make economic relations the main axis of cross-strait policy .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
While in prison she kept herself occupied by studying philosophy , writing novels , and doing embroidery , but it was a very bleak time . She was still in jail when her mother died . The sadness of that occasion , along with worry about the future , triggered a relapse of her thyroid cancer . She received medical parole and soon thereafter applied to go abroad .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable . As WAP equipment becomes widely available , you will be able to get important Internet information anywhere , condensed by transcoding technology into a form suitable for display on small devices . The open-source Linux operating system , which has appeared in the last several years , will make it easy for all types of platforms to be conveniently connected to one another .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
And Tan Hong-hui , head of the Lee Giong-chiu Taiwanese Language Foundation , describes the debate over Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin as " an effort to decide which rotten apple is preferable . " Tan 's primary concern is that an inappropriate choice of a standard romanization system could have an adverse impact on future efforts to teach Taiwanese to school children . Hanyu Pinyin is based strictly on Mandarin , and ca n't be used to represent some of the sounds in Taiwanese .  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent . Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
Again and again the young woman enters and exits the subway , trying to feel or imagine the world which is being obscured by the dark . She is in a complex emotional state-she is made uncomfortable by stares , afraid of the future , panicky . A facade of happiness hides a deeper sadness . But in the midst of disappointment , hope is reborn ; despair gives rise to a fresh chance at life .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
Hsiao Tsu won her case , but the judge ruled that there was no concrete basis for her NT $ 15 million claim , and also said that one can not demand future education funds in a lump sum , and consequently rejected this claim in favor of one based on a standard selected by the court .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
Outline : Some Amis who have come from Hualien and Taitung to seek work in the urban areas of northern Taiwan , but who can not forget their ways of living close to nature back home , have chanced to come together and settle on some unoccupied land behind Yuan Ze University in Chungli , Taoyuan County . Here over ten families work , fish , gather vegetables , chat and sing together . The contrast between their uncertain future and their happy-go-lucky attitude of living in the present adds a poignancy to otherwise amusing events .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
Chiueh Tzi-hong is confident that future astronomy programs will naturally come to generate more " added value . " He quotes the example of the participation of the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Physics in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) program led by ethnic Chinese Nobel laureate Professor Samuel Ting . The AMS instrument , which is designed to detect antimatter cosmic rays in space , will fly on the International Space Station , and Taiwan is responsible for manufacturing some of the electronic circuitry .  
On a more concrete level , points of consensus included : Mainland investment policy will be guided by the principle " proactive opening , effective supervision . " This marks the end of the era of " no haste , be patient . " In the future , a schedule will be established for allowing investment in mainland China for specific sectors and products .  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
Joining the WTO may be an inevitable trend , but at a time when all countries are eager to conquer new territories overseas and put up a protective umbrella for their weaker domestic industries , perhaps Taiwan too should be giving more balanced attention to the future of different sectors of society .  
Shih points out , " Fries , tropical fish , and high-end salt water fish have already become the three main pillars of future aquaculture in Taiwan . " Taiwan 's aquacultural technology is cutting edge . Its foundation in the development of tropical fish strains and the breeding of fries is solid .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery . In the future , there will be a demand of US $ 2 billion for fries in the Asia-Pacific region . As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
However , an even greater breakthrough is the way the integrated curriculum redefines the " textbook . " In future both the approved textbooks now used in elementary schools , and the standard textbooks used in junior high , may be relegated from their leading classroom role to a supporting role , for " diverse teaching materials " and " school-developed courses " are another big change introduced by the new curriculum .  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
Ever curious about foreigners , the rural children were always bashful . In their eyes , in which black and white were so finely contrasted , and in their candid smiles , you could see the hope and future of their country . However , when they opened their mouths , it always made me feel uneasy , for they would always say , " Amiga !  
According to Steven Chang , " Green spaces , books , cafes . . . regardless of where knowledge-workers are from , they all want a leisurely , comfortable , liberal environment in which they can explore the limits of their creativity . " He says that the creation of an outstanding living environment is critical to Taiwan 's future economic competitiveness .  
I want to emphasize that in the future Taiwan industry must , on the foundation of a sound manufacturing sector , continue to extend outward to the two ends of the " smiling curve , " moving toward a strategy of increasing added value , and producing smaller volumes of more diversified and differentiated products . There must also be movement toward upstream R &amp; D and innovation , as well as downstream marketing and distribution .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
Examination Yuan vice president nominee Chang stated that if endorsed she would assist in civil service system reform by advocating professional and effective management of government agencies . In the future , public officials would need to be certified , and those that failed to meet the new criteria would be phased out .  
Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible . In fact , they are often at cross-purposes , and the resulting confusion has made it still more difficult for Taiwan to chart a course for the future .  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
It seems clear that in the future , once technologies such as streaming media , wireless networking , digital TV and broadband transmission have matured , all human activities will be able to be satisfied in the digital world .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
Moreover , there is national financial distress with the government deficit exceeding NT $ 3 trillion . If loans are raised to hire unemployed workers , then a balanced budget will not be attainable within the foreseeable future . This bill would also dampen the improving economy and delay financial reform efforts , and the misallocation of resources would influence larger government projects , and be detrimental to long-term economic growth .  
Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment . This valuable investment would assist them in gradually becoming more productive and finding suitable work . The intangible " social capital " that would accumulate is not something readily measured by GNP .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
In consideration of this , on March 3rd the Executive Yuan convened an inter-departmental meeting on " Promoting and Maintaining Tourism and Traveler Safety . " The purpose was to require all publicly operated scenic recreational areas to implement comprehensive inspections and to upgrade safety standards to international levels . This would include reinforcing inspection systems , adopting inspection certificates , establishing inspection teams to conduct periodic random inspections , and strengthening public accident insurance , all to prevent future tragedies from occurring .  
At the end of April , Huang Jung-tsun reported the latest developments in elementary and junior high school English education to the Legislative Yuan . He emphasized that the MOE has consistently opposed the teaching of English at the first and second grade level . Furthermore , he warned that schools who persist in teaching English to first and second graders would automatically be disqualified from receiving any MOE subsidies in the future . Presumably , if these schools have the resources to hire the extra teachers , then they are not in need of government assistance .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
Traditional crafts often represent the lonely road to the land of the starving artist . Yet the young Chen Chih-hang was steadfast in choosing this path . " Tinsmithing , to be sure , has fallen on hard times , " he thought to himself , " but because it 's not a crowded field there is more room for new thinking and creativity . Therefore , its future ought to be pretty good . "  
In the past Taiwan placed excessive importance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and created a monopoly of electrical power supply , thereby excluding opportunities for development of renewable sources of energy . Thus the President emphasized , " In the future we should , acting through liberalization of the power market and various subsidy measures , increase incentives for diversification of sources of energy . "  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
" Although you could n't really say that the number of contracts actually signed is huge , we 're setting ourselves up for the future as a kind of consultant , helping integrate and strengthen each individual client according to their respective distribution weaknesses , " says Choice Group vice-chairman Jimmy Cheng . Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
For Chiang Wei-shui personally , the 144 days that he spent in prison as a result of his two arrests connected with the incident provided him with an opportunity to do more reading and thinking . During this time he immersed himself in the theory of political and social movements and laid a solid foundation for the future development of such activities in Taiwan .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
At the end of November , the Legislative Yuan was buzzing as legislators rushed to get key bills affecting the nation 's future and the economy passed . Legislative assistants ( LAs ) , responsible for helping their respective party caucuses negotiate the content of legislation and then mobilize legislators to vote on it , lost track of time and many could be found wandering around enveloped in a haze of exhaustion .  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams . The main path for the children of working class families was to finish primary school and get a job in a factory . Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
After you go abroad , broaden your world-view and get to know more people , you become more independent and confident . I am no longer nervous when I have to speak in front of crowds . I am always looking forward to meeting new friends anytime and anywhere . I have developed a new attitude toward my future life , and my English has surely improved very much .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Writer Li Ang was n't bothered that she was unable to make it to the top this time . She figured this was a perfect foreshadowing of a future trip up the mountain when the azaleas would be in bloom . " I 've traveled all over the world . I never imagined that the most beautiful spot was right here under my feet . "  
" In the past some licensing companies just did n't care and forced artists to sign licensing agreements that covered ' all ' of their works . And you know , this ' all ' included creative work done in the past , present and future . They really strongarmed them , " says Ivan Fan , deeply upset at this unfair treatment of the artists .  
Of particular importance was the fact that although the hydroelectric plant was to be donated gratis to the local community , the community would then be responsible for all future management and upkeep . This was deemed the only way to ensure sustainable operation and prevent the facility falling into disrepair for lack of maintenance as soon as the aid team left .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
The rapid advance of genetic research is giving substance to the medical world 's high hopes for the future . As the function and interactions of our 35,000 genes are analyzed and explained , genetic screening will facilitate effective disease prevention and drug treatment at every step of human development , from the embryonic stage to old age . The age of personalized medicine seems sure to arrive , with all the benefits it will bring .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .

This summer two typhoons hit Tai - wan in close succession , washing away homes and crops , destroying roads , and killing people , demonstrating again the awesome power of nature . Besides rescuing citizens and repairing roads , another response to the disasters has been renewed discussion about excessive use of mountain slopeland . The Executive Yuan has announced that it will begin studying new land-use regulations , and in future it is possible that development , agriculture , and residential construction will all be banned from mountain slopes .  
Over a decade ago , a program was developed here that balances conservation and agricultural use through a " shelterbelt / base / facilities " approach . Can this approach , along with the increasingly successful development of ecotourism , help create a new future for the controversial highland farming industry ?  
Typhoon Herb 's furious assault on central Taiwan in 1996 provoked waves of criticism of the overexploitation of hillside land areas . In view of social trends and the impact of Taiwan 's future accession to the WTO , it was decided that the NTU farm would switch to eco-experience tours and environmental education : thus was born the " Meifeng Eco-Experience Camp . "  
Looking to the future , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that NHI premiums will have to increase to ensure that hospitals can survive , the public can get needed medical care , and the NHI program itself can stay solvent . The caveat is that besides increasing revenues , restraining expenditures and eliminating waste are the only viable long-term options for saving the program , and the only means of achieving a satisfactory result for the government , the health care sector , and the public .

Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
Let us suppose , then , that the world of the future will have to be shaped according to regions , or large integrated groups or communities , regional or otherwise , that have a common cultural origin and wish to be identified with the others , because of the particular characteristics of their culture , such as tradition , language , religion and even mixed blood . 
Panama , which is today a stable and secure democracy respectful of human rights , with a Government that represents with full legitimacy a people determined to shape for itself a great future of peace and well-being , wishes to remain the cross-roads of international trade , open to all parts of the world , where , in an era of globalization and market integration , the goods and services that are the principal wealth produced by nations can circulate .  
The need to stabilize the political situation in that country is strictly linked to the future prospects of the ongoing political stabilization in neighbouring Rwanda , where mankind has recently witnessed horrible crimes and the untold suffering of innocent civilians . 
Nevertheless , we continue to hold the view that unless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the international community , no meaningful progress for the next 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future by the developing countries , especially the least developed among them .  
It is but a means to an end , and it will only be meaningful if we are united in the view that a strengthened and revitalized United Nations is an imperative , given the inescapable reality of today 's global village ; that the world of the future will need more , not fewer , effective international collaborative mechanisms to confront common threats ; and that the United Nations remains the only available instrument for the necessary global effort required to tackle these challenges .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
We must now assuage our hurt by rising above our differences and coalesce into a strong , unified nation , determined to move forward to a better and prosperous future .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
We are increasingly becoming aware that the world is one family , and that if we are to assure a brighter and better future for coming generations , we have no other choice than to continue our efforts towards preserving and promoting a strong United Nations that will be able to pursue a common purpose for a world of equity , justice and shared economic progress .  
The entire civilized world , with great concern and indeed with growing alarm about what will happen to future generations , has been observing increasing incidents of international terrorism , religious fanaticism and ultra-nationalism .  
Mohammed Bedjaoui , whose name , renown and work are intimately linked with the noble objective of strengthening the rule of law based on justice and equity , has shared with the Assembly his exemplary reflections , which will naturally find their proper place in the plans being developed by Member States with a view to launching the United Nations into the next century with the certainty of a future that is brighter than the tumultuous past 50 years of its existence . 
We , the leaders of the modern world , are faced with a great responsibility : we must be united and rise above our distinct personal , party and national interests , and seek the vision of a new world which will hold a future for every individual , every nation and State , for the universality of spirit and for the tolerance of the different .  
We have moved from an authoritarian Central America divided by war to a democratic and united Central America which today is building its future through a regional alliance for sustainable development .  
Riera Escudero ( Paraguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Republic of Paraguay , which has a long history of authoritarian Governments , has enjoyed full civil and political freedoms for more than six years now , as part of a democratic process which , slowly but surely , is being consolidated and strengthened , with the consensus of a noble , peace-loving and hard-working people that makes daily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its children . 
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important in the historical development of the United Nations , not only because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional institution of universal scope , which was established to analyse , debate and seek solutions to problems of common concern to mankind , but also because current circumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the future of our Organization .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
In this fiftieth anniversary year , the United Nations has reached a critical turning-point in appraising its past and in charting a viable course for its future , based on the renewed commitment , trust and consensus of its Member States . \ x { e51c } o save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .

The adoption and future implementation of the prototype for the new format of the medium-term plan for the period 1998 to 2001 , the introduction of a transparent and efficient system of accountability and responsibility , and the decentralization of regional economic commissions and of social and economic activities : all these are reform measures that foster administrative and financial efficiency in the Organization in the economic and social spheres .  
The United Nations must tirelessly continue to demonstrate to the men and women of this era that the prevailing openness in the world offers a formidable opportunity for the future , an unexpected chance to transcend our differences in order to attain what I once referred to as the irreducible human element , that is , the quintessence of the values by which we define ourselves as a single human community .  
Basing itself upon those principles and aspirations , Peru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes that the Organization should give serious thought to its future and to the course which international society is taking , so as to achieve a more complete vision encompassing different international realities based upon mutual respect and fairness among Member States .  
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
Only when the United Nations has a representative , democratic and transparent Security Council that maintains the proper relationship with the General Assembly and that makes correct use of the powers entrusted to it by Member States will we have a truly effective Security Council ; only then will the United Nations be able to meet the demands and challenges of the future .  
In addition to the great efforts to reform the United Nations system and thus enable the Organization to meet the growing challenges of the future , the practice of transparency by which I mean a daily striving for real contributions to be made to the Council 's decision-making process by all countries concerned is a feasible and practicable course .  
We also reaffirm the importance of a continued role by the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the peace process and call upon Israel to honour its commitments under relevant resolutions of international legality in the interests of a better future of peace , tolerance , human development and economic and social development in the region .  
Building upon political and economic stability , ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed that contribute to consolidating the opening of our economies , the transparency of our markets , and the growth of commercial exchange with other regions in short , the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a better future for our peoples .  
My delegation expresses the hope that this debate may reflect the tone of an international community resolved to fight for its future , a community that in the midst of its needs and aspirations has confidence that the United Nations can faithfully carry out the mandate of the World Summit for Social Development , which , as this General Assembly has already stated , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative for humankind .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
In this context , the continued support of the United Nations system and the international community , which is recognized in this draft resolution , will be critical in providing the people of Haiti with a second chance to secure a democratic future , in which their political and development aspirations can be fulfilled .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
We therefore consider it our obligation to reiterate once again that the ultimate solution to the problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices in various parts of the world is to achieve a complete ban on the production , stockpiling , exporting and proliferation of this type of inhumane weapon , and the future efforts of the international community must be directed towards this objective . 
The Secretary-General 's report is a technical compilation of the answers received from some States , without its own input and without the views of so many competent international organizations that are daily preoccupied with current and future developments in the Balkans .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it .

Mr . KISLYAK ( Russian Federation ) said that the Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was an international event of paramount importance in terms of the achievement of strategic stability .  The main task of the Conference was to reach a decision on the extension of the Treaty , inasmuch as all States - large and small , nuclear and non-nuclear alike - needed the Treaty and the Treaty 's effective operation must continue in the future .  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
Thus , it was suggested that the creation of a single international criminal court would better serve the rule of law by offering fuller guarantees of the objective , impartial and uniform application of the future Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind than would ephemeral , ad hoc jurisdictions .  
He noted that international justice required independence from the decisions of political organs , and that , in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
The report recommended four main areas of future focus at the macro level : advising on social objectives and the efficient handling of the economy ; creating productive employment ; revamping the agriculture sector ; and strengthening the national database to measure social progress .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
When I left Rwanda , with mixed feelings , I was convinced that the Rwandese people , with the help of the international community , including the help of the United Nations and African neighbours , would surely be able to master their own future and destiny , on the basis of an in-depth analysis and digest of the historical experience and lessons .  The Rwandese people are faced with a very arduous task of rehabilitation and reconstruction .  
However , they were divided on the future role for UNEP ; the majority were in favour of a continued and enhanced role for UNEP and argued that environmental action demands that complex issues cutting across sectors be monitored from a global environment perspective .  
Notes with concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also that there is as yet no process or timetable for concluding the National Convention ;  
It was stated that the issues of security should be considered with respect to a broad range of issues regarding negotiability .  In connection with its discussion of security issues , in particular the use of cryptography , the Working Group agreed that possible future work by UNCITRAL should not affect mandatory rules of national legislation adopted for public policy reasons in certain States to restrict the use of cryptography or the export of cryptography-related techniques .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
The purpose of integrated plans and strategies is to develop a consensual vision for the future and to identify common priority issues and key activities within a framework that provides for consensus-building and planning and the creation of the institutional support required for sustainable development .  
Without the active support of the Somali people , it is unlikely that future humanitarian programmes will meet with much success , and more than likely that the gains , made through the combined efforts of international agencies and committed Somali partners , will be undone .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
Encourage the future development of peace research involving the participation of women to examine the impact of armed conflict on women and children , and the nature and contribution of women 's participation in national , regional and international peace movements ; engage in research and identify innovative mechanisms for containing violence and for conflict resolution for public dissemination , for use by women and men ; ( d ) bis Develop and disseminate research on the physical , psychological ,  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In 1994 , these activities included preparatory work - state-of-the-art surveys , definition of a conceptual framework and institutional linkages for future programme action - in two main areas : ethics and governance , and the interface between political , institutional and economic aspects of governance .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
Such an attempt would be at least partly speculative , but the attempt would be incomplete if it ignored some of the key factors that are bound to influence future international economic relations and , inevitably , the economic well-being of the peoples of developing countries .  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
Moreover , in order to exercise its role in providing policy guidance in operational activities , the Council may wish in the future to request the executive boards of the funds and programmes to address the relevant issues arising from the triennial comprehensive policy reviews on the basis of a common report prepared by the concerned organizations ( see para . 17 below ) .  
The main task of high-quality policy development is to provide professional help in terms of statecraft 's attempt to influence collective trajectories into the future , so as to decrease the probability of bad futures and increase the probability of good ones , taking into account that these concepts may change in time .  This requires thinking in terms of grand strategies and great enterprises , with emphasis on realistic visions .  
Ms . PE \ x { 54fb } ( Mexico ) , Vice-Chairman , reporting on the informal consultations on draft decision A / C . 5 / 49 / L . 51 , said that it had been decided that Member States ' respective share of the unencumbered balance of $ 805,000 gross ( $ 891,000 net ) for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994 inclusive would be set off against the apportionment falling due to them in respect of whatever future mandate period ( s ) were approved by the Security Council .

As we anticipate a continued and reinvigorated United Nations presence in Liberia , let me state that my Government stands ready , together with other members of ECOWAS , to participate in the consultations that the Secretary-General intends to undertake prior to making his recommendations to the Security Council on the future of UNOMIL . The unresolved political crisis in Liberia remains worrisome to the subregion . 
We note with regret that half a year has passed since the signing of the Accra agreement , but that the Liberian parties have not implemented its basic provisions , thus demonstrating a clear disregard for the future of their own country and for the aspirations of its people , a people essentially held hostage to the personal political ambitions of the leaders of the armed factions .  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .  
Periodic internal reports have been instituted for the following items , as stated in paragraph 59 of document DP / 1995 / 33 : income and expenditure including administrative costs ( monthly ) ; outstanding advances to executing agencies ( monthly ) ; resource availability by source of funds ; current and future commitments ; pledges ; actual contributions and receivables by source of funds , donor and by projects ( quarterly ) .  
The Fifth Summit will chart ASEAN 's future direction towards intensifying political , economic and functional cooperation to make ASEAN an even more cohesive and dynamic regional grouping .  
Decided that there should be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 805,000 United States dollars gross ( 891,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994 , inclusive .  
The work before the Panel is characterized by two main considerations : first , the broad scope and complexity of issues that need to be dealt with in a very limited time-frame ; second , the fact that in planning its work the Panel needs to consider the anticipated outputs of a large number of ongoing processes and initiatives in order to develop a cohesive and comprehensive perspective and to formulate options for future action .  
All those working at the Tribunal realize the historic role which they have to play in setting precedents for future international criminal organs , notably a permanent criminal court - " the missing link of international law " - and they have watched with great interest the tentative moves towards turning the United Nations International Law Commission 's draft statute for a permanent criminal court into a viable court .  
The commission of inquiry might be of assistance here as well inasmuch as it might make recommendations concerning appropriate legal , political or administrative measures , for such measures are probably necessary if Burundi is in the future to avoid not only the vortex of Rwanda , but also the twin dangers of a dictatorship based on the predominant majority of one ethnic group as well as a dictatorship based on a firepower monopoly of the other ethnic group . 
The Organization also stated that its activities directly addressed , inter alia , such issues raised in the programme for the third term of the Decade as the problem of ILO Conventions that had not achieved wide ratification , institutional means of action regarding the implementation of international labour standards , the ILO programme of work relevant to the progressive development of such standards and future trends in this regard in ILO 's specialized field .  
We are fully cognizant of the fact that the shared historical and cultural heritage of the States , countries and territories of our Association provides a solid basis for developing our efforts at cooperation and concerted action , particularly in the areas of tourism , trade and transportation , as well as for enriching our future to the benefit of all our peoples ;  
By its decision 49 / 413 B of 12 July 1995 , the General Assembly decided that there should be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 805,000 gross ( $ 891,000 net ) for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994 , inclusive . 
The international community , by providing massive humanitarian assistance during the civil conflict and fielding a peace-keeping operation in support of the Lusaka Protocol , has demonstrated remarkable solidarity with the people of Angola in their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future .  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
The international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , endeavoured at the San Francisco Conference , 50 years ago , to create an international Organization that would be able to prevent such calamities in the future by establishing the political , economic and social conditions for a new , more peaceful and safer world .  
The United Nations symbolizes the constant aspiration of men who , with a vision of the future , enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter the purpose of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war ; reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human being , and embodied among its purposes the maintenance of international peace and security . 
My country believes that all Members of the Organization should rise above their differences and shoulder their responsibilities in order to show their true intentions and stand for a common peace that will take the United Nations into the twenty-first century , in which sustainable development will become integral to all nations in the search for a peaceful , secure and bright future for succeeding generations .  
And to offer it as evidence of a global-level saving shortage , one would have to calculate a global real interest rate that embodied the expectations of inflation in a variety of currencies over an indefinite future , and would also have to take account of actual interest rates in each of the relevant markets : all in all , a formidable research task .  
We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts , to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world :  
NULLTo encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .  
In future , the World Bank will be increasing the role of field staff relative to headquarters , and the consequent expansion of capacity in the Bank 's resident missions in Africa will be largely derived from the hiring of qualified local professionals .  
The implementation of a sound macroeconomic policy framework is seen as a key determinant of future financial stability and rapid economic recovery .  
We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality , and we call upon the States of the world :  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
In his report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , the Secretary-General noted that representation of ACC members was at the senior official level , that this arrangement had led to a substantive dialogue on coordination issues of mutual interest and that he considered that , should the institution of joint meetings continue to be maintained , they should be organized in the future along similar lines ( A / 48 / 639 , para .  NULL  
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .  
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .  
Certain parties seemed to have adopted a selective approach to the Rio commitments , either because the threats posed to the global environment had been exaggerated or because a decision had been taken to ignore the dangers , leaving them for future generations .  Perhaps some considered that the problems were specific only to the third world , but that view was shortsighted .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
The Working Group is convinced that , without a long-term strategy benefiting from the effective contribution of all the players , first States and then the international organizations and non-governmental organizations concerned , it is difficult to envisage , even in the more or less distant future , the attainment of so ambitious an objective as universal enjoyment of the right to development .  
several requests for 1995 intakes were received from our traditional co-sponsoring partners , such as the Institute for International Education and others , these represented a small number of many of the worthy proposals both inside South Africa and abroad that could not be given proper consideration in the absence of recommendations on the Programme 's future .  
resident coordinators ' annual reports , now more regular and substantive , would , in the future , be reviewed in the light of the various organizations ' concerns , and the coordinators had greater power in that all programmes required their final clearance .  
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

Mr . AYALA LASSO ( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ) said that the collective vision of the United Nations of the future was that of an Organization reflecting the fact that all human beings were the true participants in the historical process and should be the direct beneficiaries of national and international policies and actions .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Also decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 2,618,600 dollars gross ( 2,217,800 dollars net ) for the period from 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,966,500 United States dollars gross ( 1,858,600 dollars net ) , for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 ;

Pakistan 's case , the tariffs applicable to certain products which were his country 's principal exports had been cut by less than one third ; in textiles , the waiver from GATT rules had been extended for another 10 years ; in agriculture subsidies for production and exports had been approved with the promise of reforms at some vague moment in the future ; and the measures taken in the area of services had had a negative impact on countries with abundant skilled manpower , such as Pakistan .  
The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris  
They conveyed the Community 's proposal to dispatch a Ministerial Trade and Investment Mission to South Africa at a mutually convenient date in 1997 and also to establish a joint CARICOM Diplomatic Mission in South Africa in the near future to advance economic , technical and cultural relations with the countries of southern Africa and with the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .  
The Committee , taking into account the assurance given by the Secretariat in paragraph 77 above , requested its Chairman to transmit a letter to the chairmen of intergovernmental bodies that received written meeting records to inform them of the relevant discussion within the Committee and of the notional costs of written meeting records and unedited verbatim transcripts , and to invite them to consider the possibility of requesting the Secretariat to issue unedited transcripts of one meeting for comparison purposes with a view to the possible substitution of such transcripts for their usual records in the future .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
Funds received or pledges recorded as receivable , attributable to future financial periods and , therefore , not credited to the income account of the period reported on .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
Allocating of resources to support the development of developing countries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and multilateral international cooperation for development are wise investments for peace and for the shared future of all of our societies .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
The United Nations was born out of a yearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of addressing problems brought about by hideous tensions and conflicts throughout the world , with a view to making planet Earth a more secure , just and friendly place for present and future generations .  
That programme , which is supported by the international financial institutions with which we have worked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation and cooperation , will enable us better to meet an economic and social future that will be more promising and that will better favour the integration of the Haitian economy into the world scene .  
In this setting , on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we observed and took part in a series of momentous statements on the universal nature of this Organization , as well as the formulation of solemn commitments to the principles and purposes that have guided and should continue to guide the future work of the United Nations . However , predictably , during the past year the purposes and principles that have guided us for over 50 years have once again undergone unilateral interpretation . 
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
First , in the health field , action is under way to reach the target of eliminating poliomyelitis ; salt iodization is being implemented ; the rate of maternal mortality has decreased from 143 in 1989 to 107 in 1995 for every 100,000 live births ; 93 per cent of all children have been vaccinated and immunized against hepatitis ; studies and evaluations have been made to supplement current child nutrition information ; and health plans have been drawn up to promote future health care .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
For our part , we have carefully analyzed our position in the light of the views expressed so far in the discussions and we will soon present our considerations in the form of an informal position paper , which will elaborate on our previously presented views concerning the most important aspects of the Security Council 's future , including one of the most difficult among them : the issue of the size of the Council and the allocation of newly created seats . 
We are committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations , which we hope will lead to real progress in fostering human and social capacity , in strengthening economic performance and in protecting the environment , thus laying firm foundations for a better future for all African people .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Even more recently , Africa signed the Pelindaba Treaty , making our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone , and thus making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the process of nuclear disarmament , which , in the context of ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty , has not gained the necessary impetus to preserve the future of mankind and to save succeeding generations from the nuclear scourge . 
I wish to recall that Australia supported resolution 50 / 70 F . We are concerned to ensure that SSOD IV is scheduled in such a way that it has adequate time to prepare and the best possible story to tell for example , to report a successfully concluded comprehensive test-ban treaty , and that the meeting itself provides a forward-looking framework for future concrete disarmament undertakings . 
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

At the Vienna Conference on human rights , the international community had recognized that human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and had charted a course of action in the field of human rights into the next century ; however , its attention and efforts must be focused on the implementation of all existing human rights instruments , not only so that the perpetrators of human rights violations could be condemned but so that the rule of law should be respected in the future . 
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
To enable timely procurement of essential goods and services required for new missions and the maintenance of ongoing missions , and in order for the Controller to exercise the authority granted under financial rule 110.6 ( Commitments against the appropriations of current and future financial periods ) , relevant criteria , restrictions and new procedures were introduced during January 1995 to facilitate requests for use of this authority in certain key areas of procurement for peace-keeping operations .  
Democratization has enhanced such access and meaningful participation and involvement for civil society actors , and for public-private partnerships ; decentralized , participatory planning and management are important features of a successful urban future .  
To consider the information provided by the Governments on their respective military and security budgets for the current fiscal year and to elaborate joint proposals for the possible adaptation of future budgets , taking into account the internal situation of each State ;  
It combines the challenge of security for all the basic human need of a reliable supply of safe drinking water and meeting the competing demands from industry and agriculture , which are crucial to economic development and food security , without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their water needs .  
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
The most important challenges to continuous and sustainable development that humanity will face in the near future will be the provision of basic necessities , such as food , shelter , a clean and healthy environment and proper education , to the growing population of Earth .  
It may be recalled that the General Assembly , in its decision 49 / 483 of 12 July 1995 , decided that there would be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,755,000 gross ( $ 16,000 net ) for the period from 1 February 1994 to 31 January 1995 , inclusive .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
Once the resolution establishing an operation has been adopted , this unit , which may be reinforced as needed by the future commanders of the main national detachments , would ensure the overall military planning of the operation by preparing , in particular , a detailed military directive and the initial order of operations . 
This is important for a number of reasons already specified , among which may be highlighted the need to advance understanding of what sustainable development means in relationship to international law and the importance of certain " benchmark principles " for guiding the drafting of national legislation , the interpretation of existing law and negotiations of future international law . 
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
Since lasting democracy requires the solid foundation of law , the process of building a functioning judicial system and a professional civilian police force in Haiti is of paramount importance for the future of that country .  
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
The aim is clear : it is to punish Cuba for seeking tenaciously to determine freely , sovereignly and independently its own political , economic and social organization ; for securing for its people a future of justice , free from foreign interference and petty interests such as those which , for more than 60 years , controlled the country under the protection of United States .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
As stated in its report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peace-keeping operation ( A / 49 / 664 , para . 36 ) , " performance reports are of critical importance not only in understanding what has happened , and what is happening , but also in arriving at a considered judgement as to what will be required in the future " .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
Egypt 's privatization policy changed in 1994 , moving away from outright sales of state enterprises towards more gradual disinvestment through the sale of shares in the country 's stock market and through long-term lease and management contracts .  Economic liberalization continued in the Syrian Arab Republic , but no major privatization is envisioned in the near future .  
A proper balance has to be struck between curative and preventive action : finding a remedy for the symptoms of past mismanagement while at the same time avoiding future calamities linked to societal driving forces .  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply . 
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
It stands against the letter and the spirit of the Armistice Agreement , recognized by the international community as the legal binding instrument to preserve stability on the Korean Peninsula until it will be replaced - hopefully in the near future - by a peaceful settlement agreed upon by all sides involved .  
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
The Organization will be a central actor in this respect for the foreseeable future , not simply because of its role within the international community , but also because Africa 's problems encompass political , economic , social and environmental dimensions that require the integrated approach that only the United Nations can provide .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
As long as the United States authorities do not impose a complete ban on these illegal flights , and as long as effective steps are not taken to prevent them , the United States will be completely responsible for any future incident ; it will be violating the most elemental norms of international law and international civil aviation and will continue to fail to comply , in particular , with the most relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention and the Montreal Protocol .  
It is widely acknowledged in Sarajevo that the joint international effort to keep essential utilities functioning and begin the restoration of the city 's physical infrastructure made a real difference by enabling the citizens of Sarajevo to survive , particularly during winter months , and by giving them hope for the future .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
As at May 1996 , in the eleventh month of intensive volcanic activity , the Territory is facing an uncertain future with a substantial part of its population relocated and its economy disrupted .  
Also , while trying to reconstruct their economy and lay the foundations for their future State , the Palestinians were aware of the need for eventual integration into a larger economic context and developing mutually beneficial ties with countries of the Middle East , North Africa and the Mediterranean basin .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
While these figures are lower than in previous cycles , they should not be construed as indicative of future trends , but rather as a temporary phenomenon , reflecting UNDP efforts to reposition itself to become a more responsive and effective organization as it adapts to current development realities and challenges .  
The major changes in the world , which have eliminated confrontation between blocs , have already had an impact on the situation in the Mediterranean region , where the outlines of a peaceful future are beginning to take shape : the Middle East peace process is proceeding , although with considerable difficulty ; the move towards peace in the Balkans is continuing ; and there is a growing understanding of the importance of establishing regional cooperation for economic growth and rescuing the environment of the Mediterranean basin . 
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
A number of quantitative parameters included in FAO 's periodic forest resources assessment and possible future national reports required under the Convention on Biological Diversity , the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Combating Desertification and the information collected for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ( CITES ) may potentially constitute such a core set .  
In areas where plantations are designed to achieve multiple purposes , especially for fulfilling subsistence needs of local populations , methodologies have to become more efficient and designed to reinforce the process of expanding forest cover .  NULLSeveral initiatives at the regional level have taken place or are planned for the near future in connection with improving the readiness to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
The Technical Meeting sought to move this evaluation process forward , giving emphasis to the necessary immediate and longer-term actions by focusing on four areas : evaluating alternative routes and their comparative costs ; considering bottlenecks in physical infrastructure and ways to remove them ; assessing non-physical barriers to the efficient use of the available transit transport corridors and steps to remove them ; and finally moving towards a framework for future cooperation .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their traditions and customs , as well as the law of the State concerned .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
During its sixteenth session , in January 1996 , the Council decided to give priority , in its future activities , to regional and subregional projects , and reaffirmed its support of projects aiming , in particular at improving the quality of communication for development ; promoting freedom of the press , pluralism and independence of the media ; promoting democracy and human rights ; supporting activities for broader participation of women in the media ; and developing community media etc .  
" The Argentine Republic is convinced that the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty would be a crucial event in fostering international trust , because it would strengthen the growing conviction that nuclear weapons are of no use for the security of nations , and would facilitate the future agenda and the negotiation of other multilateral measures regarding disarmament , non-proliferation and arms control . "  Charg d'affaires a.i .  
For the international regime for the storage and control of plutonium , the question for the near future is hardly whether or not to establish a full-fledged regime , but whether to prepare a legal framework and an option for countries to deposit fissile material when they deem that desirable , hence proceeding in a gradual , pragmatic fashion .  
With regard to the future work of the Special Committee , the draft declaration on the basic principles and criteria for the work of United Nations peacekeeping missions and mechanisms for the prevention and settlement of crises and conflicts submitted by the Russian Federation should be carefully studied in order to draw up a complete , precise and innovative text in an area which was so important for the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security .  
Participants in the high-level segment recognized that , in future work , more attention should be paid to addressing the driving forces that impacted on the sustainable management of natural resources while at the same time giving more attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development , including combating poverty .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that follow-up efforts should focus on how Governments comply with their obligation under international law to conduct full , independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions transmitted to them , with a view to clarifying the circumstances , identifying and prosecuting those responsible , granting compensation to the victims or their families and preventing future violations .  
It is the obligation of Governments to carry out exhaustive and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of the right to life , to identify , bring to justice and punish their perpetrators , to grant compensation to the victims or their families , and to take effective measures to avoid future recurrence of such violations .  The Special Rapporteur has noted that impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of violations of human rights , and , in particular , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
At the governmental level , the exercise of power in what were certainly crucial moments for the future of the country was gathered in the hands of the President of the Republic , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Defence and the National Security Council , while the other ministers in the Government were barely kept informed of Burundi 's request for foreign security assistance made at the 25 June Arusha Summit and supported by the Yaound Summit a dozen or so days later . 
The Special Rapporteur also deems it essential to set a timetable with the de facto authorities for the holding of free and fair legislative elections in the near future , with the active participation of the entire population of Burundi .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
The recommendation in paragraph 50 of the Committee 's report , to the effect that in future scales of assessment , all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum rate of 0.001 per cent , should be implemented as soon as possible .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
Thus , for example , Tunisian women have been encouraged to set up production enterprises in various sectors and have benefited from numerous opportunities giving them access to the highest responsibilities in administrative and decision-making circles , opening up the way for their participation in all consultative bodies dealing with national affairs and the people 's future , and to the fulfilment of their role in a civil society whose basis is the elimination of all forms of direct or indirect exclusion .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,970,718 United States dollars gross ( 1,718,168 dollars net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 ;  
The situation facing UNRWA in the last quarter of 1996 was untenable because its cash reserves had been depleted , and replenishment could only be effected by immediate payment of pledges already received ; further future deficits could no longer be absorbed because the Agency 's working capital would have been exhausted by the end of 1996 ;  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
Mr . MWAKAWAGO ( United Republic of Tanzania ) said that the international community was looking forward to the twenty-first century with a mixture of hope and despair : hope for the opportunities created by the liberalized and globalized markets of the future , and despair over the persisting high levels of poverty , especially in developing countries , which could undermine the advantages deriving from expanded markets and global partnership , unless the vicious cycle of poverty was broken and a process of economic recovery and growth was initiated .  
In that regard , it was not clear whether the reform of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) that had been proposed by its Administrator focused on the level of resources or on the Programme 's efficiency , and he wondered whether that process would be reviewed by the Governing Council , and whether the Administrator 's initiative concerning the reform of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations was a personal initiative or was part of a review of the level of resources to be allocated to operational activities for development in future .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Employers found guilty of abusing domestic workers were liable to heavy sentences , including jail terms and corporal punishment , and were permanently barred from employing foreign domestic workers in the future .  
The establishment of adequate internal controls at an early stage was a key requirement which should be borne in mind for future peacekeeping missions , since it would provide reasonable assurance that financial and administrative matters were properly handled during the life of the mission .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
For all those reasons , and in view of its previous request for the strengthening of support to the Committee , made at its fourth session it expressed its willingness to be involved in future consultations with the Secretariat to ensure the optimal use of available resources and the effective performance of its functions , in the light of article 43 , paragraph 11 of the Convention .  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .  Can the historical realities which influenced the Council 's composition 50 years ago be paralleled or matched in any way by present contingencies ?  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
These fears were then exploited by extreme rightist organizations and neo _ Nazi cells , which directed the frustrations of a proportion of the region 's unemployed youth , lacking a social identity or prospects for the future , towards foreigners .  
Relevant information should also be provided on the progress achieved in the implementation of article 40 , any difficulties encountered and targets set for the future , as well as disaggregated data on the children concerned , inter alia by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , national , social and ethnic origin , offence and disposition made available .  
Finally , once the target has been identified , a plan of action needs to be developed to meet the objective ; section III thus gives an integrated presentation of ISWGNA work programmes , highlighting recent achievements and reviewing proposed priority areas for future work in the light of expressed country needs .  
The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space [ 5 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
First , a modern , fair and transparent personnel policy , in which placement and promotion played an important part , and the strict implementation of that policy were crucial determinants of the effective future performance of the Organization . The General Assembly , in resolution 47 / 226 , had urged the Secretary-General to improve all personnel policies , yet that requirement had still not been implemented .  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
\ x { f448 } RK ( Slovenia ) said that the Code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind would complement the functioning of the future international criminal court and also serve domestic legal systems by unifying the criminal law and practice concerning the crimes which were considered to be the most serious crimes under international law .  
The Secretariat could prepare draft final articles that established a procedure for revision of the future Code , defined the relationship between the latter , the draft statute of the international criminal court and international conventions or treaties , and prohibited the formulation of reservations with a view to ensuring the universality and integrity of the Code .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
While retaining its great ability for political and financial mobilization and intensive , joint work with Governments , UNICEF , under the excellent leadership of Ms . Carol Bellamy , and with a renewed mandate , is focusing on supporting Government efforts to settle outstanding issues , consolidate the gains that it has already achieved and work more effectively to meet present and future challenges . 
The Panel agreed that [ existing or any future body of ] [ any future ] international forest-related legal mechanism [ s ] must deal cohesively with all the interrelated social , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues and have a concrete impact on the future successful implementation of [ sustainable forest management ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] worldwide .  
We think that it is necessary to establish the practice of convening regular meetings between the official representatives of these organizations , in order to exchange opinions on a future security model for Europe , to divide their responsibilities properly within the framework of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security in the OSCE region , and to elaborate relevant arrangements for coordinating their activities and decision-making .  
As a State that has completed the withdrawal of strategic nuclear missiles from its territory , we believe that it is extremely important to make joint efforts to lay the foundations for a firm and peaceful future for Europe .  
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
The Group of 77 and China were willing to consider the projected vacancy rates for the 1996-1997 biennium , with the following provisos : that the Secretary-General should not exceed those rates and should certify at the end of the biennium that all mandated programmes had been fully implemented ; that those rates had been accepted by the General Assembly on an exceptional basis , and should not set a precedent for any future budgets ; and that they should not be used to accommodate any additional unfunded mandates in the overall level of appropriations .  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .

With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Nonetheless , it wishes to express its concern that , in light of the considerable social and economic problems facing the country , insufficient efforts are being taken by the State party to devise preventive strategies to ensure that such problems do not become more prevalent , thereby endangering future generations of children .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
In view of the continuing widespread violations of human rights in Kosovo as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the opening of an office of the High Commissioner in Prishtina , as well as an increased presence of other international organizations , would be indispensable for gathering reliable information on future human rights developments .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .

There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .

Thus , in the light of this mandatory requirement for future peacekeeping operations , the Member States that have already pledged to the standby arrangements system may wish to exchange in advance data required by annexes A , B and C to the Memorandum of Understanding on contingent-owned equipment ( A / 51 / 967 ) , within the framework of the standby arrangements system .  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
Lastly , we would like to place on record that we joined in the consensus on this resolution on the understanding that any negotiating exercise that may take place in the immediate future must ensure that a requisite and necessary balance be struck between humanitarian concerns and the legitimate security interests of the States concerned .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,

The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
Given the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entire international community for the future of the planet , the Organization certainly needs to be renewed in order to confront effectively and successfully the exciting yet disturbing challenges posed by globalization .  
Since recovering its territory and water under the peace treaty signed with Israel in October 1994 , Jordan has maintained its pivotal role in the process and continued its efforts with the other parties to achieve the desired goals of establishing a just , comprehensive and lasting peace which will be accepted , preserved and protected by future generations .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
The debate and negotiations that took place during the three sessions of the Working Group held in 1997 covered , in a balanced way , the substantive and diverse issues included in both clusters , and demonstrated the complexity of this process of reform which , despite opposing interests , the vast majority of Member States hope will produce a Security Council that represents the current composition of the Organization and effectively responds to the future challenges of the United Nations .

We , the representatives of the Serbian ethnic community , are convinced that in the sense of the aforementioned we have not even hypothesized a possibility of diminishing or limiting the relevant civil rights of the present and future inhabitants of the region under the Transitional Administration in the Republic of Croatia .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .

Given the limited capacity of the judiciary , the lack of knowledge about national legislation among the population , and the lack of resources to make use of the court system , the large majority of the population will in practical terms have their legal status defined within the framework of traditional systems in the foreseeable future .  
As the distinction was difficult to apply in practice , the Commission should in the future base its work on any given topic on international conventions and custom and the recognized principles of law and should then proceed to consider what contributions to progressive development might be acceptable to the international community .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
It is therefore clear that if there is to be genuine improvement in the disturbing situation in the former Sectors , efforts by both international and local organizations to promote confidence and reconciliation will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future .  1 International observers had estimated the total number of killings which had taken place in the former Sectors in circumstances unrelated to the military actions of August 1995 to be at least 120 ( see S / 1995 / 1051 ) .

Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .

Members will recall that , on the occasion of that historic event , the debate about our common future was often polarized into the choice between rural sustainability and urban migration , between the green agenda and the brown agenda , between developed and developing economies .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .  
Our overriding and ultimate concern is to ensure a clean and safe planet that is hospitable and friendly to human life , now and in the future .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
Cases referred to included : the Hungarian minority in Slovakia , where in schools of the national minorities , history and geography was taught by ethnic Slovak teachers , which allegedly led to a distortion of historical truth and thus negatively affected future generations of Hungarians learning about their own past ( Federal Union of European Nationalities ) ; the Arab minority in Israel , where educational guidelines and policies were designed to entrench the values of the Jewish culture , and the characteristics of the identity of the Palestinian minority were suppressed .

The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
What was needed was an innovative , effective and lasting approach , based on a common set of principles for future debt negotiations , which would include arrangements for a substantial reduction of all categories of debt .  
In the light of this evidence , the Government of Cuba feels it has a moral obligation to alert the international community once again to the dangers threatening the future and stability of international relations if effective steps are not taken to eliminate the proliferation of measures such as this blockade , which , besides affecting the well-being and health of a people , attempts to limit the sovereignty of other States and to ignore the growing call throughout the world that it be lifted .  
For the purposes of realizing the will of the people and their right to self-determination , creating a responsible Government , preventing a monopoly of power and administrative corruption , electing representatives to the electoral bodies , ensuring free and fair periodical election of the leadership ; the principles of democracy and pluralism shall constitute the mainspring of the future political system to be formed in Afghanistan .  
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
Only the Organization , as a universal body , could take up in an integrated and coherent manner those vital problems which created an unequal world and determined a bleak future for hundreds of millions of people .

There is considerable agreement on the conceptual content of the right to adequate food , including relevant health and nutrition aspects , and future efforts in this regard need to be directed primarily at fine-tuning existing concepts .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
Both plants will be subjected , in the immediate future , to a detailed technical evaluation by the original suppliers to identify the most efficient and effective way to restore their capacity to an acceptable level of availability and reliability .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .

The forward rate would be free to differ from the current spot rate and a growing forward discount on the spot exchange rate ( assuming interest rates remained unchanged ) would be an indication of expected future depreciation of the spot rate .  
The Committee decided that in the future it would meet in private half an hour before starting consideration of a country report , in order to pinpoint the main problems to be addressed during public discussion .  
The Conference should examine the psychological , social , political and economic factors that made individuals receptive to racism , in view of forecasts concerning future ethnic and racial conflict .  
The complex issues raised by migration should be addressed in a constructive manner in order to build a future of tolerance and mutual understanding and to dispel the very real fears associated with the phenomenon .  
By adopting the Statute of a permanent , independent , effective , transparent and non-selective international criminal court , the Conference would be leaving an enduring legacy to future generations .  
While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
They support exchanges and cooperation , including joint projects , in basic and applied scientific research as well as in areas of research and development with potential for the development of modern society and sustainable economic growth in the future .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
The remarkable thrust of activity at the upstream level is indicative of the potential role of the different components of civil society in national policy-making in the short to medium-term future .  
The Board recognized the threat posed by rapid technological innovation in future warfare and was keen on pursuing some of the consequent policy implications for the United Nations system .

It also recommended adopting the 20 / 20 concept of mutual commitment for basic social programmes , providing youth with a secure and healthy future , and supporting efforts for capacity-building for human development .  
A document entitled Education for a viable future in the Americas is being prepared , which reflects international thinking on the subject , following the meeting on that theme organized by UNESCO in Thessaloniki , Greece , in December 1997 .  
As requested by the participants , the future parliament would only be composed of democratically elected representatives designated by central African States where free and fair elections are held .  
The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
My country also highlighted the great importance of fostering sustainable development , whose objective is to harmonize human activities and nature by means of policies and actions that will achieve an efficient and fair economy , a just society and the preservation of the environment , in order to ensure a better quality of life for present and future generations in a safe environment .  
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
As a future venue and a focal point for the Mine Ban Convention and the various activities in the field of mine action that it will produce , Geneva would offer a wide variety of diplomatic and technical expertise , a broad representation of diplomatic missions and humanitarian agencies and relevant non _ governmental organizations , including ICRC , WHO , UNHCR and the newly established Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining .  
These two agreements and their follow _ up mechanisms provide a comprehensive response to the problems posed by anti _ personnel landmines , although the complete removal of the millions of mines scattered around the world will regrettably continue to be one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of the international community for the foreseeable future .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
We also welcome the determined and energetic position of Ms . Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , who has understood perfectly the magnitude of our responsibility to future generations and the vital importance of protecting children as one of the sectors whose vulnerability puts in jeopardy the very existence of the human race on our blue planet .

The Working Group agreed that a future draft of subparagraph ( b ) should reflect the changes discussed : notice should be given without undue delay ; the two standards of knew or ought to have known and is or might have been compromised should be included in square brackets as alternative texts ; and the words and could be used to create unauthorized enhanced electronic signatures should be deleted .  
In short , the Office of the High Commissioner is gearing up for the challenges of the future with principled commitment , rational and efficient managerial practices , new methods , and renewed energy from its staff throughout - as will be seen in the ensuing sections .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
There was no point in speaking of sustainable development when some countries members of the Forum faced the prospect of being submerged by the sea in the not too distant future , and atolls were being polluted by nuclear tests .  
The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .

Comrade Mao Zedong said during the rectification campaign in Yanan : Only when we master Marxism can our contingent be consolidated , can our cadres be enhanced in quality , and can we have the ability to meet and to have control over a future bright world .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
The department has carried out rectification and reform at a deeper level , strengthened investigation and study , closely integrated " looking back " with " looking forward , " thought of , discussed and grasped big things , paid greater attention to future work , and further enhanced its political sensitiveness and ability to distinguish political matters .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
It can create " future " wars based on the general law of development governing hi-tech wars and by taking into full consideration China 's security posture , international influence , political and geographical environment , national characteristics , and other distinct features .  
By means of virtual reality , we can transform the future into the present as the direct subject of thinking and achieve the " seamless linkage " between the past , the present , and the future in the realm of thinking .  This brings the mode of thinking more in sync with the systematic , comprehensive , and multidimensional characteristics of military thinking .  
We should concentrate our manpower as well as financial and material resources on building a group of high-ranking academies and universities that have clear-cut military characteristics .  We should give priority to supporting a group of academic departments and laboratories that have utmost bearing on future wars .  These academic departments and laboratories will play a role as an initiator and demonstrator for all military academies .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .

Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
In the light of the characteristics that the new ground-to-air missiles are mobile and have quick flying speed and strong low-altitude defense capacity , they have established the method of organizing the air defense brigade into " two groups and one team " to cope with future operations , and studied the combat tactics of combining the efforts to resist and fight back with the efforts to hold back and intercept the incoming aircraft .  
Bearing in mind Dandong 's key antichemical warfare work targets , the antichemical warfare detachment of the local troops conducted the exploratory drill to counter possible direct or indirect use of chemical weapons by the enemy in future warfare .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
As we look back at the narcotics control course traveled by the Chinese nation and view the changing anti-drug situation in the world , we soberly realize that the numerous social problems caused by illegal drugs are posing increasing threats to China 's economic development and social life and to the future of the Chinese nation .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .

"  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
The new leader of the Taiwan authorities stressed that in its long-term development prospects , the Taiwan navy must have the strategic goals of being a " crack , small , and strong force " , meaning that it should advance in the following ways : First , it must focus its vision on the distant future and draw up as soon as possible its mid and long-term manpower building plans ;  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
The units involved have summed up and popularized the achievements that the army has made in scientific and technological troops training in recent years .  Through repeated attempts for improvement , innovation , and development , they have eventually solved knotty problems that have puzzled the army for a long time regarding operations under future hi-tech conditions .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .  
The meticulous strategic setup that the United States worked out in Russia 's neighboring countries was not only designed to squeeze Russia 's strategic space but also to set up in advance an effective strategic support platform to interfere in the Euro-Asian region affairs in future .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
The fishermen are skilful at operating their vessels and are familiar with sea conditions , sea routes , and the geographical conditions of harbors , thus laying a strong foundation for them to carry out their future task of participating in battles and supporting the battlefront at sea .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
They have insisted on gearing toward the need of a future war and tried to integrate the armament work in peacetime with the armament work in wartime " .  For example , a certain armored division has reorganized its repair personnel according to the current establishment system .  These repair personnel have been assigned to work in accompanying teams , advance teams , and mobile supply teams .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
The rapid and drastic development of infrastructure and basic industries have basically resolved the bottlenecked restrictions for the economic and social developments and further strengthened the momentum for long-term development in the future .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Party committees at all levels must uphold a strong sense of being responsible for the party 's cause and the military 's construction , think of the future , make long-term plans , devote prolonged effort , and be responsible to generations to come even if they themselves are only in the position for one term .  Party committees at all levels must devote meticulous , long lasting , and permanent effort to building up the foundation and to daily implementation so as to realize overall improvement through overall consolidation and pursue comprehensive implementation through comprehensive progress .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
Chen Shui-bian expressed his belief that the leaders on both sides of the strait have sufficient wisdom and creativity , and are absolutely able to find some " common ground " and consensus acceptable to both sides , so as to jointly handle the issue of " a future one China " based on " existing foundations " .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
After viewing the experimental demonstration on management of computer network security conducted by the PLA Security Committee at the Jinan Military Region and after hearing the experiences introduced by various military units , Deputy Chief of General Staff Qian Shugen emphasized that ensuring the network security is by no means a simple issue of security , but is an essential mission to prepare for " winning the war . "  He added that ensuring the network security is a key guarantee for winning the future wars , and therefore maintaining secret means " winning the wars . "  
Only thus can we avoid making subjective judgments and acting blindly .  Only by persisting in seeking truth from facts can the content of arduous struggle be unceasingly renewed , the hardworking spirit be passed on to future generations , and the banner of arduous struggle attract , amass , and inspire the people .  
In light of characteristics of a hi-tech war in future , the unit had decided to hold in an unfamiliar water area a training exercise centered on several highly difficult training topics , such as rapid camouflage on the sea , protecting itself against an enemy 's electronic jamming , countering an enemy 's hi-tech reconnaissance , and so on .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
With firm faith in acting as their own masters and in ushering in a brighter future for Macao , Macao compatriots have actively supported , cooperated with , or supervised the SAR Government in managing government affairs in accordance with " The Basic Law " and have become a mainstream in the Macao society and a healthy force propelling the society ahead as well .

We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Just as a weak president is bound to face strong opposition in Congress , the White House and the Congress are bound to find friction or contradiction between them on a regular basis , and this will become a salient characteristic of the US political arena in the future .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
As a result , the troops have achieved the purpose of learning to give self and mutual medical aid on the battle ground ; the exercise has reached a reliable theoretical basis for the troops in grasping and using troop disposition , board and lodging , and fighting and hiding of the squad to reduce to the maximum degree casualties of non-combat personnel for future operations in the lofty mountains and jungles ; and the achievement has filled gaps in the aspect of field survival for troops .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
Strongly aware of future dangers , allowing no opportunities to slip , and seizing every minute , we will fulfill our work in all aspects , strive for a leap in China 's military modernization in the new century , and comprehensively enhance the armed forces ' defensive combat capability under modern technological conditions , particular high-tech conditions , so as to better perform the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  
During the process of completing the " 863 " research topics , the scientific and technological personnel throughout the army as well as scientific research administrations at all levels have also carried out bold practices in the field of high-tech management .

The readings he finished in six months piled up to over 2 meters high .  He believed that those who are not proficient enough at maneuvering modern equipment can not be counted as qualified military commanding personnel , and only by optimally integrating high-quality personnel with hi-tech equipment , will it be possible to explore the equipment 's utility to the maximum and thus gain dominance in future hi-tech warfare .  
Zhang Wannian 's current visit is carrying on the past traditions and opening a way for the future , which is aimed at increasing mutual understanding and trust , promoting friendly cooperation , and impelling the steady and healthy development of relations between the two countries and armies .  
The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Developed countries , and even some developing countries , have invariably realized that a trial of strength in a future hi-tech war will first and foremost be a trial of strength over science and technology , and a comprehensive trial of strength over science and technology is , in the final analysis , competition over qualified personnel .  In a certain sense , it could be said that the outcome of today 's competition over qualified personnel will decide the outcome of tomorrow 's fighting on a battlefield .  
If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
This marine brigade , which is dubbed " China 's no . 1 army , " has been set up with great care to fight and win in a future partial hi-tech war ; every one of its members has to undergo training from hell , be familiar with all kinds of weapons , be skilled in close combat , and have the ability to live off the land .

As far as the departments are concerned , in calculating how much money they can spend in the future , they do not take the budget for the previous year as the base figure but instead make decisions according to how many tasks they have ; if they have tasks to accomplish , they will have the money to spend , and if the tasks have been completed , their funds are cancelled accordingly ; thus we ensure that all expenditure goes on the crucial points in building the units .

US President Bush recently issued a series of tough statements regarding cross-strait affairs and US support for Taiwan . In the wake of these statements , Communist China 's authoritative personages in charge of Taiwan affairs said that Communist China 's high-ranking personnel are paying close attention to the future actions on the part of the United States . If the United States continues getting involved in cross-strait affairs , Communist China might be forced to resolve the Taiwan issue ahead of its schedule by resorting to tough means .

According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .

In the foreseeable future , cases involving the two sides will develop in the direction of " private international law . " That is , Taiwan and the mainland will be treated as two separate " legal jurisdictions " and the concepts for dealing with " conflicts of law between two jurisdictions " will be employed .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired . The discussion revolved around living in a foreign land , coming to terms with the new land and the old , where the future of China was headed and so forth . Everyone talked in full confidence , unable to stop , and the seminar did n't break up until one o'clock at night .  
After a bleak period lasting some years radio is back on its feet again , and facing the future with renewed optimism . Television is the chief adversary of radio among the broadcast media , but surveys reveal that the most popular radio presenter over the last two years has been Lo Hsiao-yun , whose program Intimate Listening airs six evenings a week from eight to ten o'clock - - which happens to be television 's prime time .  
In other words , the elderly lack a sense of security about the future and do n't want to wait idly for death , so they need another stage on which to play out the remainder of their lives . " Hsieh Tseng Fang-lan believes services of this kind have a promising future , and the response from outside has been most gratifying . The manpower bank has yet to be officially registered but enquiries are pouring in , with a need for services ranging from technical advisers for refrigeration and air-conditioning to electricity meter readers .  
Ever since the early days Li has relied on a makeshift approach , surviving from one show to the next with profits serving as funding for the following production . In this way the company has put together eighteen productions with over 400 individual performances , and earned a surplus of NT $ 2 million . Information about their future works that appears in the program notes also indicates how well they plan the year in advance .  
" Opposition from the minority engaged in fisheries was understandable , " says Lin Chong-min , engineer with the firm of consultants , " but otherwise the project involved no appropriation of private holdings and no removal of people 's homes . Also there would be no pollution from the project after its completion , and in the future it could even bring a boom to the area . Yet most respondents neither supported nor were opposed to the plan . "  
The main difference between the two blueprints is that Kaohsiung City Government , which is the landlord and is carrying out the initial sea reclamation work , hopes to find a new face for the city in the new land , and is wary of letting it fall into the hands of outsiders . The Ministry of Communications , however , which operates the international port at the same location and is responsible for overall future on-site development , emphasizes the national interest and sees the new territory in terms of energy resources and transportation infrastructure .  
Huang Wen-po has other ideas : " No matter whether the artistic status is crude or refined , these new style chen-t'ou are all products of a given era , have social significance , and deserve to be recorded . As for whether they can survive in the future , that 's for the market to decide . " He continues , " These type of chen-t'ou are refreshing , and at the very least are lots of fun , so there 's no point in attacking them . "  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
" When the current eight secondgeneration warships are completed , we will have the capability for independently designed and produced large-scale warships , which in the future can be sold abroad , " explains a high ranking officer from the naval construction development center , indicating confidence in the project scheduling .  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed . So there are many areas where the military authorities and local government will have to work together in the future .  
Q . Some People are worried that with the use of cheap and abundant mainland labor , some of our labor-intensive industries will transfer investment and set up factories on the mainland which could influence the speed of our own industrial upgrading . They are also worried that when the mainland has absorbed our technology and capital , in the future they can turn around and destroy Taiwan 's native industries . What is your view ?  
But the detailed contents - - whether or not in the future an agency specially responsible for foreign aid will be established , exactly what the foreign aid ratio should be , whether diplomatic or economic considerations should be predominant - - have not yet been determined .  
From Peachwood Charms to New Year 's Scrolls : Ever since ancient times , everybody from high officials to lowly peddlers has used these scrolls to display their literary proficiency or express their yearnings for the future . The joyous red-scribed scrolls , their contents ranging across the spectrum of hopes and propitious wishes , never fail to get the spring season off to a rousing start .  
One unmarried social worker is worried that if she marries , it will affect her current employment . Another is worried about the problem of educating her children in the future , and keeps putting off getting married . Yet another , a single woman who owns an interior design business , quite frankly sticks to a philosophy of remaining single as a way to reduce the responsibilities of housework , " states the Cheng-Liao study .  
He satirizes feminine pettiness and cupidity , but he 's afraid to get into other areas . Playing the opposite sex is even tougher to bring off since guardians of public morality keep a close watch on the airwaves , and audiences are growing a little tired of it from overuse , what with Auntie Tung , Sister Wai , Old Lady Yang , and so forth , on practically every show . Hsiao Tung will gradually " recover his manhood " in the future , Pai Mei-hung reveals .  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
Planning has been completed on a second science-based industrial park , designed to be a future stronghold of high-tech industry . The Ministry of Economic Affairs is promoting the development of 64 promising key technologies such as liquid crystal displays and compact disk drives .  
It 's a new field , developed only five or six years ago , where we are n't that far behind other countries and where there are wide prospects for future applications . Although some scholars are worried they wo n't fit in with other industries , " high-temperature superconductors do n't require a huge investment , and as long as we keep at it , there 's a good chance we can hold our own with any other country , " Hsu Shiang-kueen says .  
At a time of limitless expectations about a prosperous future , we have no way to avoid the heavy costs of technology : environmental pollution , the rapid depletion of natural resources , and even human vulgarity .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
This was a time of deep reflection . When I looked at things in worldly terms , it seemed that I lacked nothing . From a happy home , I had no problems with my studies , and in appearance and ability I was no worse off than most other people . It seemed that my future was clear cut - - start a career , get married and have children and pass what would be considered to be a perfect and happy life .  
Alliance case study number four - - palmtop computers . Although the main trend for the future seems to be small , specialized R &amp; D centers belonging exclusively to a single industry , the Industrial Technology Research Institute - - which has been in a league by itself for the past nineteen years and has accumulated countless resources - - is still the center of attention .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds . His lively and fine depictions of Chinese birds and their habitats has led many people , including some ecologists , to exclaim : " The Chinese have not been good at giving realistic renderings of birds and their habitats , which is something they should strive hard to do in the future . "  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
On the one hand he hoped that his eldest daughter , who once dyed her hair purple and even planned to get herself tattooed , would start acting less like a foreigner and more like a Chinese ; but more importantly , over the last decade the North American economy had been going steadily downhill , while Taiwan had been developing far better than he had ever expected , and with family and contacts here , he thought that if his children returned they would have better chances for the future .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
Seeking for strong potential : According to data from the Directorate-General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics , Executive Yuan , the proportion of over-65s in the Taiwan region will reach 7.1 percent next year , meaning that the ROC meets the United Nations definition for an elderly society . The future will inevitably bring an increase in rates of chronic disease , and transdermal patches can provide a more effective , simpler means of medical treatment . "  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
In order to gain a more prosperous future , Buhe applied at his research institute last September for a sabbatical leave of one year . He is looking into starting a partnership with his friend exporting steel , hoping to make a little extra money to secure his future life . Naturally , because of the toils of hard work , he has not had time to practice his music .  
Give future scholars opportunities to do research , " One enjoys an antique , generally speaking , by admiring fine workmanship , a well-reasoned structure , the luster and grain of beautiful wood . Is it of magnificent appearance , at once stately and full of energy ? Is the workmanship of its embellishments wise - - outstanding without overwhelming its basic shape ? Are its lines smooth and pleasing to the eye ?  
I really feel that this is unfair to the workers of the Water Conservancy Bureau . I am also greatly concerned that no scenic places will be left for our future generations . I implore the various relevant agencies to do away with their own opinions , to put aside egotistical , improper behavior , and to think more of the generations to come !  
It 's just unfortunate that no interdisciplinary study of facial tattoos was carried out in years past . A lack of pictures for future research and analysis is particularly vexing . Frustratingly , all one can do is sit and watch as respected tribal elders pass away one after another .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
When Tsai Ming-liang went up on stage on December 10 to collect his Golden Horse for best director , he said , choking with emotion , that he hoped his actors would have his good luck in the future . Back stage , he could n't hold back , crying for longer than the film 's famous lachrymose last scene . Finally , calming down and returning to his jocular self , Tsai said , " I had n't known how powerful the Golden Horse Award was , that it would make me cry for so long . "  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
Kung Peng-cheng , now a professor in the Graduate Institute of History at Chung Cheng University and tapped to be president of the future Fo Kuang University , sees part of the problem as being innate to education in a capitalist system . Students pay tuition , while professors are paid by the credit . " It 's ridiculous to ask the students to respect the teachers in a situation where knowledge is assigned a monetary value . "  
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
This is particularly because the marriage market has subtle self-regulating abilities : not only is there flexibility in the age at which people marry , but with today 's increasing numbers of divorced , remarried and single people , marriage has broken away from its traditional form , and concern that future Adams will find no Eve seems unnecessary .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
We want to guide the new generation to understand their homeland , love their country and develop a broad international perspective . Thus fortified , they can better meet international challenges and map out a bright future for their country in an increasingly competitive global village .  
Another oral history of note is that of the musician and actor Liu Chin , a member of the Taiwanese opera troupe of the legendary " Ilan Ying . " Liu 's seventy-year lifespan has essentially coincided with the rise and fall of Taiwanese opera . Because Liu was very familiar with the late Ilan Ying , through interviews with Liu the character and personality of Ilan Ying are vividly depicted , yielding valuable first - hand information for future researchers studying the history of Taiwanese opera in Ilan .  
" Assuming that the initial French recording process was in violation of the law , then all future uses of this unauthorized material , including those by Enigma and the IOC , would all be unlawful as well , " explains Huang Hsiu-lan , Difag 's attorney , in a firm tone of voice . She has received approval from Difag to use " the most intensive legal methods " to handle the case .  
While the rates of adjustment varied , they could be as high as 100% - for example , the fee for " partial liver removal " was raised from NT $ 4000-plus to NT $ 8000-plus . As for complaints by surgeons that they are " low-wage labor , " Parng states that in the future the main focus of adjustments in universal health insurance pay schedules will be on respecting doctors ' special skills .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
Far from his native place , Su looked back on his frustrated career and felt he had spent 30 years in a dream of illusory glory . On awakening he now found himself mired in the mud of human politics , his future uncertain . He felt like a fish caught on a hook , unable to swim up or down .  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
Without a degree , they ca n't become teachers . And the special coaching program has been discontinued . Many weightlifting instructors at the primary level are serving in the guise of " substitute teachers . " These primary-level teams are the training ground for " fresh troops " for the national team in the future .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
Remembering the day five years ago when Wei-wei was diagnosed as a hyperactive child by a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , Ho says , " I sat in the car and the tears just would n't stop falling , regretting the past , worrying about the future . . . . I was pained by the number of times our boy had been hit even though he was innocent . It hurt me that I had made so many wrong choices and that our son had been wrongly accused so many times .  
If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
If the scope of liberalization is too broad , problems will result . If there is total liberalization , then future owners need not actually farm the land . Given that illegal use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes is already widespread , it would be almost impossible to regulate future use at all if land need not be owned by farmers themselves . Rampant speculation , a food crisis , or other severe problems might ensue .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
Huang Chien-yi also reveals that in a future textbook edition which is still at the experimental stage , historical and mythical exemplary personages have almost disappeared , and the few remaining representative persons are all taken from daily life . The old style of teaching loyalty and filial piety by expecting children to model themselves on saints and sages is to disappear .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
This second limitation means that some 2.6 million " workers with no fixed employer " and self-employed people will be excluded from the unemployment insurance system . Their loss will be compensated by their being excused from paying the 1% of Labor Insurance contributions earmarked for unemployment insurance , and they will continue to be eligible for the existing assistance such as vocational training and new-job bonuses and loans . CLA chairman Chan Huo-sheng also promises that in the future , unemployment insurance will be gradually extended to cover these workers .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
There are still many tasks for the future . Among the feasible directions for the gay movement would be establishing an information hotline especially for gay issues , making the homosexual movement broader and more in touch with the grass roots level , coordinating groups at various levels , and developing social commentary with a uniquely gay perspective .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
In response to the global trend of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , the government is encouraging large-scale reforestation . But rapid planting of single-species forests in previously cleared areas implies that in the future , each such area will contain only one producer species , thus limiting biodiversity and creating incomplete and fragmentary food chains .  
Later , in Singapore , Chiu and Tang Shubei , vice chairman of ARATS , repeatedly emphasized the " four natures " of the Koo-Wang talks : non-governmental , economic , pragmatic , and functional . The two parties agreed to put aside relatively sensitive political issues that they disagreed on . Obviously these " four natures " referred not only to the Koo-Wang talks , but could also be seen as guiding principles for future handling of cross-strait relations by the associations .  
What concrete suggestions could be applied to future Koo-Wang talks ? This question is the subject of the third and last part of this paper . At present , the ROC National Reunification Guidelines provide the guiding principles in facing pressure from Communist China . Although they are not perfect , if their basic spirit is grasped , and they are flexibly used , I believe they can best serve the national interest of our country .  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
Ho Chun-jui continues : " There are other aspects as well , such as smashing ' the virgin complex , ' resisting domestic violence , and gay activism . Everywhere you can see that gender self-awareness does n't have to be taught , that it is flowing through society . A future in which everyone is conscious of gender issues is not only inevitable , it is to be looked forward to . "  
Tenray Chou was director of reporting at the China Times in 1979 , when Swun Yun-hsuan was ROC premier , and Taiwan 's first television show in which government officials faced the camera to explain government policy was being aired . Chou planned the show jointly with the directors of reporting for the Central Daily News and the United Daily News . Even then Chou had a dim sense that the future lay with electronic media .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Also , in the future , whole historic settlements or streets can be considered monuments to be preserved . Finally , a law governing control and treatment of rare diseases , will allow importation of appropriate medications , treatments , and essential life-saving nutritional supplements for those suffering from tens of unusual ailments .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
And he appointed Tang Fei , a member of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and a four-star general , to become premier . As a result , Chen 's standing with the public has shot upward . A Gallup poll showed that 81% of respondents were satisfied with Chen 's performance thus far , and had great hope for the future .  
On the day after his inauguration , during a visit to Kinmen , Chen pointed out that under the precondition of ensuring national security , the new government would , based on the laws of the market and the principle of reciprocal and proportional benefit , reexamine the three links . The Executive Yuan is in fact already engaged in an urgent discussion of the three links . Human rights diplomacy In the future , the government plans to make economic relations the main axis of cross-strait policy .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
While in prison she kept herself occupied by studying philosophy , writing novels , and doing embroidery , but it was a very bleak time . She was still in jail when her mother died . The sadness of that occasion , along with worry about the future , triggered a relapse of her thyroid cancer . She received medical parole and soon thereafter applied to go abroad .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
All of these developments will have a huge impact on the future well-being of the human race , yet for many of us they are distant and unfamiliar . This is particularly true of genetic engineering , considered the biggest breakthrough in the life sciences since genetics and molecular biology . Man has begun to probe the very origins of life .  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
Looking to the future , as DSL and other broadband technology matures , large amounts of visual and audio information can also be transmitted through high-speed fiber-optic cable . As WAP equipment becomes widely available , you will be able to get important Internet information anywhere , condensed by transcoding technology into a form suitable for display on small devices . The open-source Linux operating system , which has appeared in the last several years , will make it easy for all types of platforms to be conveniently connected to one another .  
Within three to six months of the end of the provisional session , the KMT plans to have completed a full review of party membership . Then there will be a direct election for the party chairman next June . In addition , in future special quotas will be set aside for youth , women , and disadvantaged groups to hold a total of 40% of the seats in party congresses , the Central Committee , and the CSC .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
And Tan Hong-hui , head of the Lee Giong-chiu Taiwanese Language Foundation , describes the debate over Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin as " an effort to decide which rotten apple is preferable . " Tan 's primary concern is that an inappropriate choice of a standard romanization system could have an adverse impact on future efforts to teach Taiwanese to school children . Hanyu Pinyin is based strictly on Mandarin , and ca n't be used to represent some of the sounds in Taiwanese .  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent . Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
Again and again the young woman enters and exits the subway , trying to feel or imagine the world which is being obscured by the dark . She is in a complex emotional state-she is made uncomfortable by stares , afraid of the future , panicky . A facade of happiness hides a deeper sadness . But in the midst of disappointment , hope is reborn ; despair gives rise to a fresh chance at life .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
Hsiao Tsu won her case , but the judge ruled that there was no concrete basis for her NT $ 15 million claim , and also said that one can not demand future education funds in a lump sum , and consequently rejected this claim in favor of one based on a standard selected by the court .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
Outline : Some Amis who have come from Hualien and Taitung to seek work in the urban areas of northern Taiwan , but who can not forget their ways of living close to nature back home , have chanced to come together and settle on some unoccupied land behind Yuan Ze University in Chungli , Taoyuan County . Here over ten families work , fish , gather vegetables , chat and sing together . The contrast between their uncertain future and their happy-go-lucky attitude of living in the present adds a poignancy to otherwise amusing events .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
Chiueh Tzi-hong is confident that future astronomy programs will naturally come to generate more " added value . " He quotes the example of the participation of the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Physics in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) program led by ethnic Chinese Nobel laureate Professor Samuel Ting . The AMS instrument , which is designed to detect antimatter cosmic rays in space , will fly on the International Space Station , and Taiwan is responsible for manufacturing some of the electronic circuitry .  
On a more concrete level , points of consensus included : Mainland investment policy will be guided by the principle " proactive opening , effective supervision . " This marks the end of the era of " no haste , be patient . " In the future , a schedule will be established for allowing investment in mainland China for specific sectors and products .  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
Joining the WTO may be an inevitable trend , but at a time when all countries are eager to conquer new territories overseas and put up a protective umbrella for their weaker domestic industries , perhaps Taiwan too should be giving more balanced attention to the future of different sectors of society .  
Shih points out , " Fries , tropical fish , and high-end salt water fish have already become the three main pillars of future aquaculture in Taiwan . " Taiwan 's aquacultural technology is cutting edge . Its foundation in the development of tropical fish strains and the breeding of fries is solid .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery . In the future , there will be a demand of US $ 2 billion for fries in the Asia-Pacific region . As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
Looking toward the future , Kao is worried about environmental damage in Taiwan . " A Japanese expert has said that in 50 years Taiwan will have to buy its drinking water from abroad . " Actively promoting a conception of global environmental education , he has not rested for a moment and is now preparing to set up the " Environmental Angel Foundation . " At the same time he is once again performing counseling for the church .  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
However , an even greater breakthrough is the way the integrated curriculum redefines the " textbook . " In future both the approved textbooks now used in elementary schools , and the standard textbooks used in junior high , may be relegated from their leading classroom role to a supporting role , for " diverse teaching materials " and " school-developed courses " are another big change introduced by the new curriculum .  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
Ever curious about foreigners , the rural children were always bashful . In their eyes , in which black and white were so finely contrasted , and in their candid smiles , you could see the hope and future of their country . However , when they opened their mouths , it always made me feel uneasy , for they would always say , " Amiga !  
According to Steven Chang , " Green spaces , books , cafes . . . regardless of where knowledge-workers are from , they all want a leisurely , comfortable , liberal environment in which they can explore the limits of their creativity . " He says that the creation of an outstanding living environment is critical to Taiwan 's future economic competitiveness .  
I want to emphasize that in the future Taiwan industry must , on the foundation of a sound manufacturing sector , continue to extend outward to the two ends of the " smiling curve , " moving toward a strategy of increasing added value , and producing smaller volumes of more diversified and differentiated products . There must also be movement toward upstream R &amp; D and innovation , as well as downstream marketing and distribution .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
But World Heritage Sites are rightfully the collective inheritance of the human race , regardless of where they happen to be located . If they meet the criteria for World Heritage Sites , then they should be designated as such . As members of the global village , we need to protect these precious assets and pass them on to future generations .  
Examination Yuan vice president nominee Chang stated that if endorsed she would assist in civil service system reform by advocating professional and effective management of government agencies . In the future , public officials would need to be certified , and those that failed to meet the new criteria would be phased out .  
Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible . In fact , they are often at cross-purposes , and the resulting confusion has made it still more difficult for Taiwan to chart a course for the future .  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
It seems clear that in the future , once technologies such as streaming media , wireless networking , digital TV and broadband transmission have matured , all human activities will be able to be satisfied in the digital world .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
Moreover , there is national financial distress with the government deficit exceeding NT $ 3 trillion . If loans are raised to hire unemployed workers , then a balanced budget will not be attainable within the foreseeable future . This bill would also dampen the improving economy and delay financial reform efforts , and the misallocation of resources would influence larger government projects , and be detrimental to long-term economic growth .  
Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment . This valuable investment would assist them in gradually becoming more productive and finding suitable work . The intangible " social capital " that would accumulate is not something readily measured by GNP .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
In consideration of this , on March 3rd the Executive Yuan convened an inter-departmental meeting on " Promoting and Maintaining Tourism and Traveler Safety . " The purpose was to require all publicly operated scenic recreational areas to implement comprehensive inspections and to upgrade safety standards to international levels . This would include reinforcing inspection systems , adopting inspection certificates , establishing inspection teams to conduct periodic random inspections , and strengthening public accident insurance , all to prevent future tragedies from occurring .  
At the end of April , Huang Jung-tsun reported the latest developments in elementary and junior high school English education to the Legislative Yuan . He emphasized that the MOE has consistently opposed the teaching of English at the first and second grade level . Furthermore , he warned that schools who persist in teaching English to first and second graders would automatically be disqualified from receiving any MOE subsidies in the future . Presumably , if these schools have the resources to hire the extra teachers , then they are not in need of government assistance .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
Traditional crafts often represent the lonely road to the land of the starving artist . Yet the young Chen Chih-hang was steadfast in choosing this path . " Tinsmithing , to be sure , has fallen on hard times , " he thought to himself , " but because it 's not a crowded field there is more room for new thinking and creativity . Therefore , its future ought to be pretty good . "  
In the past Taiwan placed excessive importance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and created a monopoly of electrical power supply , thereby excluding opportunities for development of renewable sources of energy . Thus the President emphasized , " In the future we should , acting through liberalization of the power market and various subsidy measures , increase incentives for diversification of sources of energy . "  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
" Although you could n't really say that the number of contracts actually signed is huge , we 're setting ourselves up for the future as a kind of consultant , helping integrate and strengthen each individual client according to their respective distribution weaknesses , " says Choice Group vice-chairman Jimmy Cheng . Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
For Chiang Wei-shui personally , the 144 days that he spent in prison as a result of his two arrests connected with the incident provided him with an opportunity to do more reading and thinking . During this time he immersed himself in the theory of political and social movements and laid a solid foundation for the future development of such activities in Taiwan .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
At the end of November , the Legislative Yuan was buzzing as legislators rushed to get key bills affecting the nation 's future and the economy passed . Legislative assistants ( LAs ) , responsible for helping their respective party caucuses negotiate the content of legislation and then mobilize legislators to vote on it , lost track of time and many could be found wandering around enveloped in a haze of exhaustion .  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams . The main path for the children of working class families was to finish primary school and get a job in a factory . Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
After you go abroad , broaden your world-view and get to know more people , you become more independent and confident . I am no longer nervous when I have to speak in front of crowds . I am always looking forward to meeting new friends anytime and anywhere . I have developed a new attitude toward my future life , and my English has surely improved very much .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Writer Li Ang was n't bothered that she was unable to make it to the top this time . She figured this was a perfect foreshadowing of a future trip up the mountain when the azaleas would be in bloom . " I 've traveled all over the world . I never imagined that the most beautiful spot was right here under my feet . "  
" In the past some licensing companies just did n't care and forced artists to sign licensing agreements that covered ' all ' of their works . And you know , this ' all ' included creative work done in the past , present and future . They really strongarmed them , " says Ivan Fan , deeply upset at this unfair treatment of the artists .  
Of particular importance was the fact that although the hydroelectric plant was to be donated gratis to the local community , the community would then be responsible for all future management and upkeep . This was deemed the only way to ensure sustainable operation and prevent the facility falling into disrepair for lack of maintenance as soon as the aid team left .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
The rapid advance of genetic research is giving substance to the medical world 's high hopes for the future . As the function and interactions of our 35,000 genes are analyzed and explained , genetic screening will facilitate effective disease prevention and drug treatment at every step of human development , from the embryonic stage to old age . The age of personalized medicine seems sure to arrive , with all the benefits it will bring .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
An aging population , a decreasing birthrate and a consequent increase in the social welfare burden-people have long been tired of hearing such negative news but many neither want nor dare to think about how this unavoidable trend will affect our future .  
This summer two typhoons hit Tai - wan in close succession , washing away homes and crops , destroying roads , and killing people , demonstrating again the awesome power of nature . Besides rescuing citizens and repairing roads , another response to the disasters has been renewed discussion about excessive use of mountain slopeland . The Executive Yuan has announced that it will begin studying new land-use regulations , and in future it is possible that development , agriculture , and residential construction will all be banned from mountain slopes .  
Over a decade ago , a program was developed here that balances conservation and agricultural use through a " shelterbelt / base / facilities " approach . Can this approach , along with the increasingly successful development of ecotourism , help create a new future for the controversial highland farming industry ?  
Typhoon Herb 's furious assault on central Taiwan in 1996 provoked waves of criticism of the overexploitation of hillside land areas . In view of social trends and the impact of Taiwan 's future accession to the WTO , it was decided that the NTU farm would switch to eco-experience tours and environmental education : thus was born the " Meifeng Eco-Experience Camp . "  
Looking to the future , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that NHI premiums will have to increase to ensure that hospitals can survive , the public can get needed medical care , and the NHI program itself can stay solvent . The caveat is that besides increasing revenues , restraining expenditures and eliminating waste are the only viable long-term options for saving the program , and the only means of achieving a satisfactory result for the government , the health care sector , and the public .  
He was born in 1968 in Shanhua Township , Tainan County . In middle school he began to attend the local Holy Church , where Rev . Wang Tung-ho filled him with inspiration and guided his religious development . In his 30s , Wang had given up a bright future in the city and moved to the countryside to minister to the ordinary folk of the township .  
to coordinate its diverse activities in china , hoechst set up in july this year an umbrella company hoechst china investment company , as the sole representative for all current and future investments of hoechst in china , responsible for all investment affairs in the country  
" cadres and the masses have further emancipated their minds and are full of enthusiasm leaders and people are united , and the whole country is seething with activity , giving promise of a wonderful future in which the chinese nation will have realized its lofty ideals , " jiang said  
It may refer to the total of the future doses committed by that source or unit of practice , as for instance , the collective effective dose committed by atmospheric nuclear explosions or by one year of medical exposures .  
This greatly complicates the future of these countries as they attempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic , political , psychological , cultural and historical problems that they have inherited from the recent past .  
Is it a crisis of identity inherent in modern societies ; a loss of traditional values and taboos ; a flight from a future darkened by economic crises and constant social change ?  
In that context , the Council requested the " Secretary-General to direct urgent preparation of a detailed plan with concrete steps setting out UNOSOM II 's future concerted strategy with regard to its humanitarian , political and security activities " .  
Because of the widespread and increasing use of commercial energy in all economic sectors of modern societies , various concerns have often been expressed about the adequacy of reserves and resources to meet future demand .

The Arab States believe that it is vital for the United Nations to move with the growing trend aimed at using action in the regional context as an indispensable contribution to the shaping of future international political relations .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .  
It bases its findings on the emergence of new strategies and structures at the firm level which , in the aggregate , suggest that a more integrated international production system is emerging and may influence the future pattern of global economic relations .  
There has also been a holistic review of the current and future potential of remotely sensed data ( satellite and airborne ) for identification and monitoring of illicit crops ( that is , opium poppy , cannabis and coca ) .  
Safe , acceptable management and final disposal of radioactive waste including spent fuel and waste from future decommissioning require coordination of a multiplicity of activities scientific , technical , economic , social , legal and political efforts .  
However , it was pointed out that as a result of the increased demand for " cartographic products " , governmentfunded national surveys had a bright future , subject to good leadership , adaptation to technological advances and increased financial selfreliance .  
The future of coal as a major fuel is problematic , mainly because of environmental concerns at the local , regional and global levels over its contribution to local pollution , acid rain and climate change .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and to include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
Territorial gains achieved by force could not be accepted and approved by the international community since they violated the founding principles embodied in the Charter and set a very dangerous precedent for the future .  
Political selfdetermination was but a first step towards national selfassertion : the economic future of the dependent Territories was crucial if their peoples were to raise their living standards in a highly competitive and complex world .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
International justice required independence from the decisions of political organs ; in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
Noting further that the future course of the net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growthoriented supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Noting that the future course of the net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growthoriented supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Having regard to the constructive role played by previous United Nations visiting missions to colonial Territories , the Committee continues to attach vital importance to the dispatching of such missions as a means of collecting adequate and firsthand information on conditions in the Territories and on the wishes and aspirations of the people concerning their future status .  
Thus , despite the deep-rooted and persistent social and institutional factors that have long affected the country , there is reason to hope that in the not-too-distant future this situation which to a certain extent is a remnant of the cold war will be rectified , leading to the achievement of the permanent peace which remains the most fervent hope of the people of Guatemala .  
" In making social issues a universal priority " , as the Secretary-General pointed out at the recently held World Summit for Social Development , " our intention is to take responsibility for the collective future of international society and to pledge ourselves anew to the ideal of global solidarity " .  
In yet another move to keep pace with the latest technological developments , the Department will make the time-consuming process of audio / visual editing as simple as word processing and will develop a future tapeless archival system that is fully networked and capable of almost instantaneous delivery of the Department 's products world wide .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
Let us suppose , then , that the world of the future will have to be shaped according to regions , or large integrated groups or communities , regional or otherwise , that have a common cultural origin and wish to be identified with the others , because of the particular characteristics of their culture , such as tradition , language , religion and even mixed blood . 
Panama , which is today a stable and secure democracy respectful of human rights , with a Government that represents with full legitimacy a people determined to shape for itself a great future of peace and well-being , wishes to remain the cross-roads of international trade , open to all parts of the world , where , in an era of globalization and market integration , the goods and services that are the principal wealth produced by nations can circulate .  
The need to stabilize the political situation in that country is strictly linked to the future prospects of the ongoing political stabilization in neighbouring Rwanda , where mankind has recently witnessed horrible crimes and the untold suffering of innocent civilians . 
Nevertheless , we continue to hold the view that unless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the international community , no meaningful progress for the next 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future by the developing countries , especially the least developed among them .  
It is but a means to an end , and it will only be meaningful if we are united in the view that a strengthened and revitalized United Nations is an imperative , given the inescapable reality of today 's global village ; that the world of the future will need more , not fewer , effective international collaborative mechanisms to confront common threats ; and that the United Nations remains the only available instrument for the necessary global effort required to tackle these challenges .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
We must now assuage our hurt by rising above our differences and coalesce into a strong , unified nation , determined to move forward to a better and prosperous future .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
We are increasingly becoming aware that the world is one family , and that if we are to assure a brighter and better future for coming generations , we have no other choice than to continue our efforts towards preserving and promoting a strong United Nations that will be able to pursue a common purpose for a world of equity , justice and shared economic progress .  
The entire civilized world , with great concern and indeed with growing alarm about what will happen to future generations , has been observing increasing incidents of international terrorism , religious fanaticism and ultra-nationalism .  
Mohammed Bedjaoui , whose name , renown and work are intimately linked with the noble objective of strengthening the rule of law based on justice and equity , has shared with the Assembly his exemplary reflections , which will naturally find their proper place in the plans being developed by Member States with a view to launching the United Nations into the next century with the certainty of a future that is brighter than the tumultuous past 50 years of its existence . 
We , the leaders of the modern world , are faced with a great responsibility : we must be united and rise above our distinct personal , party and national interests , and seek the vision of a new world which will hold a future for every individual , every nation and State , for the universality of spirit and for the tolerance of the different .  
We have moved from an authoritarian Central America divided by war to a democratic and united Central America which today is building its future through a regional alliance for sustainable development .  
Riera Escudero ( Paraguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Republic of Paraguay , which has a long history of authoritarian Governments , has enjoyed full civil and political freedoms for more than six years now , as part of a democratic process which , slowly but surely , is being consolidated and strengthened , with the consensus of a noble , peace-loving and hard-working people that makes daily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its children . 
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important in the historical development of the United Nations , not only because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional institution of universal scope , which was established to analyse , debate and seek solutions to problems of common concern to mankind , but also because current circumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the future of our Organization .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
In this fiftieth anniversary year , the United Nations has reached a critical turning-point in appraising its past and in charting a viable course for its future , based on the renewed commitment , trust and consensus of its Member States . \ x { e51c } o save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . 
While my delegation is fully committed to participating actively and constructively in future consultations on new modalities for funding for operational activities for development , we believe that what is now crucial is the political will and determination of all parties on how best to arrest the downward spiral of resources for development . 
The adoption and future implementation of the prototype for the new format of the medium-term plan for the period 1998 to 2001 , the introduction of a transparent and efficient system of accountability and responsibility , and the decentralization of regional economic commissions and of social and economic activities : all these are reform measures that foster administrative and financial efficiency in the Organization in the economic and social spheres .  
The United Nations must tirelessly continue to demonstrate to the men and women of this era that the prevailing openness in the world offers a formidable opportunity for the future , an unexpected chance to transcend our differences in order to attain what I once referred to as the irreducible human element , that is , the quintessence of the values by which we define ourselves as a single human community .  
Basing itself upon those principles and aspirations , Peru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes that the Organization should give serious thought to its future and to the course which international society is taking , so as to achieve a more complete vision encompassing different international realities based upon mutual respect and fairness among Member States .  
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
Only when the United Nations has a representative , democratic and transparent Security Council that maintains the proper relationship with the General Assembly and that makes correct use of the powers entrusted to it by Member States will we have a truly effective Security Council ; only then will the United Nations be able to meet the demands and challenges of the future .  
In addition to the great efforts to reform the United Nations system and thus enable the Organization to meet the growing challenges of the future , the practice of transparency by which I mean a daily striving for real contributions to be made to the Council 's decision-making process by all countries concerned is a feasible and practicable course .  
We also reaffirm the importance of a continued role by the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the peace process and call upon Israel to honour its commitments under relevant resolutions of international legality in the interests of a better future of peace , tolerance , human development and economic and social development in the region .  
Building upon political and economic stability , ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed that contribute to consolidating the opening of our economies , the transparency of our markets , and the growth of commercial exchange with other regions in short , the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a better future for our peoples .  
My delegation expresses the hope that this debate may reflect the tone of an international community resolved to fight for its future , a community that in the midst of its needs and aspirations has confidence that the United Nations can faithfully carry out the mandate of the World Summit for Social Development , which , as this General Assembly has already stated , is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative for humankind .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
In this context , the continued support of the United Nations system and the international community , which is recognized in this draft resolution , will be critical in providing the people of Haiti with a second chance to secure a democratic future , in which their political and development aspirations can be fulfilled .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
We therefore consider it our obligation to reiterate once again that the ultimate solution to the problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices in various parts of the world is to achieve a complete ban on the production , stockpiling , exporting and proliferation of this type of inhumane weapon , and the future efforts of the international community must be directed towards this objective . 
The Secretary-General 's report is a technical compilation of the answers received from some States , without its own input and without the views of so many competent international organizations that are daily preoccupied with current and future developments in the Balkans .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it . 
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .  
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education . 
This was a matter dealt with by the World Conference , which recognized the need for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and within the framework of balanced and sustainable development .  
Our Government is more than determined to take the reins of its destiny and lead its people to the brightest , most peaceful and prosperous future that its current limited economic , infrastructural and organizational capacities can provide .  
The informal cooperation that now exists on security issues in the region and the conclusion of more formal economic cooperation arrangements have contributed significantly towards building confidence in the prospect of a more secure , democratic and prosperous future for southern Africa .  
Many crucial steps remain to be taken to achieve the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of Haiti and to provide for the Haitian people a peaceful and stable future based on democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law and on economic and social justice .  
This is based on the need to train future decision-makers to take an interdisciplinary approach to the promotion of technology by evaluating the environmental , sociological , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological innovation and implementation .  
The Board held extensive deliberations on its future work , including a full exchange of views with the Secretary-General , who requested the Board to provide guidance on how the theme of sustainable development might be incorporated in each of the several forthcoming major conferences , and how the action programmes that emerged could be more effectively implemented .  
Mr . KISLYAK ( Russian Federation ) said that the Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was an international event of paramount importance in terms of the achievement of strategic stability .  The main task of the Conference was to reach a decision on the extension of the Treaty , inasmuch as all States - large and small , nuclear and non-nuclear alike - needed the Treaty and the Treaty 's effective operation must continue in the future .  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
Thus , it was suggested that the creation of a single international criminal court would better serve the rule of law by offering fuller guarantees of the objective , impartial and uniform application of the future Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind than would ephemeral , ad hoc jurisdictions .  
He noted that international justice required independence from the decisions of political organs , and that , in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
Four of the five nuclear-weapon States and some of their allies had taken a clear position on the Treaty 's indefinite and unconditional extension , but with regard to such matters as the pace of the negotiations on a complete test-ban treaty , peaceful nuclear explosions , the future of nuclear energy for civilian purposes and negative security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States , the overall impression was that it was business as usual .  
The report recommended four main areas of future focus at the macro level : advising on social objectives and the efficient handling of the economy ; creating productive employment ; revamping the agriculture sector ; and strengthening the national database to measure social progress .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
When I left Rwanda , with mixed feelings , I was convinced that the Rwandese people , with the help of the international community , including the help of the United Nations and African neighbours , would surely be able to master their own future and destiny , on the basis of an in-depth analysis and digest of the historical experience and lessons .  The Rwandese people are faced with a very arduous task of rehabilitation and reconstruction .  
However , they were divided on the future role for UNEP ; the majority were in favour of a continued and enhanced role for UNEP and argued that environmental action demands that complex issues cutting across sectors be monitored from a global environment perspective .  
Notes with concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also that there is as yet no process or timetable for concluding the National Convention ;  
It was stated that the issues of security should be considered with respect to a broad range of issues regarding negotiability .  In connection with its discussion of security issues , in particular the use of cryptography , the Working Group agreed that possible future work by UNCITRAL should not affect mandatory rules of national legislation adopted for public policy reasons in certain States to restrict the use of cryptography or the export of cryptography-related techniques .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
The purpose of integrated plans and strategies is to develop a consensual vision for the future and to identify common priority issues and key activities within a framework that provides for consensus-building and planning and the creation of the institutional support required for sustainable development .  
Without the active support of the Somali people , it is unlikely that future humanitarian programmes will meet with much success , and more than likely that the gains , made through the combined efforts of international agencies and committed Somali partners , will be undone .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
Encourage the future development of peace research involving the participation of women to examine the impact of armed conflict on women and children , and the nature and contribution of women 's participation in national , regional and international peace movements ; engage in research and identify innovative mechanisms for containing violence and for conflict resolution for public dissemination , for use by women and men ; ( d ) bis Develop and disseminate research on the physical , psychological ,  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In 1994 , these activities included preparatory work - state-of-the-art surveys , definition of a conceptual framework and institutional linkages for future programme action - in two main areas : ethics and governance , and the interface between political , institutional and economic aspects of governance .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
Such an attempt would be at least partly speculative , but the attempt would be incomplete if it ignored some of the key factors that are bound to influence future international economic relations and , inevitably , the economic well-being of the peoples of developing countries .  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
Moreover , in order to exercise its role in providing policy guidance in operational activities , the Council may wish in the future to request the executive boards of the funds and programmes to address the relevant issues arising from the triennial comprehensive policy reviews on the basis of a common report prepared by the concerned organizations ( see para . 17 below ) .  
The main task of high-quality policy development is to provide professional help in terms of statecraft 's attempt to influence collective trajectories into the future , so as to decrease the probability of bad futures and increase the probability of good ones , taking into account that these concepts may change in time .  This requires thinking in terms of grand strategies and great enterprises , with emphasis on realistic visions .  
Ms . PE \ x { 54fb } ( Mexico ) , Vice-Chairman , reporting on the informal consultations on draft decision A / C . 5 / 49 / L . 51 , said that it had been decided that Member States ' respective share of the unencumbered balance of $ 805,000 gross ( $ 891,000 net ) for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994 inclusive would be set off against the apportionment falling due to them in respect of whatever future mandate period ( s ) were approved by the Security Council .  
Ms . PE \ x { 54fb } ( Mexico ) , Vice-Chairman , reporting on the informal consultations on draft decision A / C . 5 / 49 / L . 52 , said that it had been decided that Member States ' respective share of the unencumbered balance of $ 1,755,000 gross ( $ 16,000 net ) for the period from 1 February 1994 to 31 January 1995 inclusive would be set off against the apportionment falling due to them in respect of whatever future mandate period ( s ) were approved by the Security Council .

As we anticipate a continued and reinvigorated United Nations presence in Liberia , let me state that my Government stands ready , together with other members of ECOWAS , to participate in the consultations that the Secretary-General intends to undertake prior to making his recommendations to the Security Council on the future of UNOMIL . The unresolved political crisis in Liberia remains worrisome to the subregion . 
We note with regret that half a year has passed since the signing of the Accra agreement , but that the Liberian parties have not implemented its basic provisions , thus demonstrating a clear disregard for the future of their own country and for the aspirations of its people , a people essentially held hostage to the personal political ambitions of the leaders of the armed factions .  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .  
Periodic internal reports have been instituted for the following items , as stated in paragraph 59 of document DP / 1995 / 33 : income and expenditure including administrative costs ( monthly ) ; outstanding advances to executing agencies ( monthly ) ; resource availability by source of funds ; current and future commitments ; pledges ; actual contributions and receivables by source of funds , donor and by projects ( quarterly ) .  
The Fifth Summit will chart ASEAN 's future direction towards intensifying political , economic and functional cooperation to make ASEAN an even more cohesive and dynamic regional grouping .  
Decided that there should be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 805,000 United States dollars gross ( 891,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994 , inclusive .  
The work before the Panel is characterized by two main considerations : first , the broad scope and complexity of issues that need to be dealt with in a very limited time-frame ; second , the fact that in planning its work the Panel needs to consider the anticipated outputs of a large number of ongoing processes and initiatives in order to develop a cohesive and comprehensive perspective and to formulate options for future action .  
All those working at the Tribunal realize the historic role which they have to play in setting precedents for future international criminal organs , notably a permanent criminal court - " the missing link of international law " - and they have watched with great interest the tentative moves towards turning the United Nations International Law Commission 's draft statute for a permanent criminal court into a viable court .  
The commission of inquiry might be of assistance here as well inasmuch as it might make recommendations concerning appropriate legal , political or administrative measures , for such measures are probably necessary if Burundi is in the future to avoid not only the vortex of Rwanda , but also the twin dangers of a dictatorship based on the predominant majority of one ethnic group as well as a dictatorship based on a firepower monopoly of the other ethnic group . 
The Organization also stated that its activities directly addressed , inter alia , such issues raised in the programme for the third term of the Decade as the problem of ILO Conventions that had not achieved wide ratification , institutional means of action regarding the implementation of international labour standards , the ILO programme of work relevant to the progressive development of such standards and future trends in this regard in ILO 's specialized field .  
We are fully cognizant of the fact that the shared historical and cultural heritage of the States , countries and territories of our Association provides a solid basis for developing our efforts at cooperation and concerted action , particularly in the areas of tourism , trade and transportation , as well as for enriching our future to the benefit of all our peoples ;  
By its decision 49 / 413 B of 12 July 1995 , the General Assembly decided that there should be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 805,000 gross ( $ 891,000 net ) for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 November 1994 , inclusive . 
The international community , by providing massive humanitarian assistance during the civil conflict and fielding a peace-keeping operation in support of the Lusaka Protocol , has demonstrated remarkable solidarity with the people of Angola in their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future .  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .  
The international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , endeavoured at the San Francisco Conference , 50 years ago , to create an international Organization that would be able to prevent such calamities in the future by establishing the political , economic and social conditions for a new , more peaceful and safer world .  
The United Nations symbolizes the constant aspiration of men who , with a vision of the future , enshrined in the Preamble of the Charter the purpose of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war ; reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human being , and embodied among its purposes the maintenance of international peace and security . 
My country believes that all Members of the Organization should rise above their differences and shoulder their responsibilities in order to show their true intentions and stand for a common peace that will take the United Nations into the twenty-first century , in which sustainable development will become integral to all nations in the search for a peaceful , secure and bright future for succeeding generations .  
And to offer it as evidence of a global-level saving shortage , one would have to calculate a global real interest rate that embodied the expectations of inflation in a variety of currencies over an indefinite future , and would also have to take account of actual interest rates in each of the relevant markets : all in all , a formidable research task .

NULLTo encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .  
In future , the World Bank will be increasing the role of field staff relative to headquarters , and the consequent expansion of capacity in the Bank 's resident missions in Africa will be largely derived from the hiring of qualified local professionals .  
The implementation of a sound macroeconomic policy framework is seen as a key determinant of future financial stability and rapid economic recovery .

MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .  
Certain parties seemed to have adopted a selective approach to the Rio commitments , either because the threats posed to the global environment had been exaggerated or because a decision had been taken to ignore the dangers , leaving them for future generations .  Perhaps some considered that the problems were specific only to the third world , but that view was shortsighted .  
Review current global trends in economic and social development as they relate to human settlements , and include recommendations for future actions at the national and international levels .  
The Working Group is convinced that , without a long-term strategy benefiting from the effective contribution of all the players , first States and then the international organizations and non-governmental organizations concerned , it is difficult to envisage , even in the more or less distant future , the attainment of so ambitious an objective as universal enjoyment of the right to development .  
several requests for 1995 intakes were received from our traditional co-sponsoring partners , such as the Institute for International Education and others , these represented a small number of many of the worthy proposals both inside South Africa and abroad that could not be given proper consideration in the absence of recommendations on the Programme 's future .  
resident coordinators ' annual reports , now more regular and substantive , would , in the future , be reviewed in the light of the various organizations ' concerns , and the coordinators had greater power in that all programmes required their final clearance .  
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris  
They conveyed the Community 's proposal to dispatch a Ministerial Trade and Investment Mission to South Africa at a mutually convenient date in 1997 and also to establish a joint CARICOM Diplomatic Mission in South Africa in the near future to advance economic , technical and cultural relations with the countries of southern Africa and with the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .  
The Committee , taking into account the assurance given by the Secretariat in paragraph 77 above , requested its Chairman to transmit a letter to the chairmen of intergovernmental bodies that received written meeting records to inform them of the relevant discussion within the Committee and of the notional costs of written meeting records and unedited verbatim transcripts , and to invite them to consider the possibility of requesting the Secretariat to issue unedited transcripts of one meeting for comparison purposes with a view to the possible substitution of such transcripts for their usual records in the future .

The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
Allocating of resources to support the development of developing countries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and multilateral international cooperation for development are wise investments for peace and for the shared future of all of our societies .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
The United Nations was born out of a yearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of addressing problems brought about by hideous tensions and conflicts throughout the world , with a view to making planet Earth a more secure , just and friendly place for present and future generations .  
That programme , which is supported by the international financial institutions with which we have worked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation and cooperation , will enable us better to meet an economic and social future that will be more promising and that will better favour the integration of the Haitian economy into the world scene .  
In this setting , on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we observed and took part in a series of momentous statements on the universal nature of this Organization , as well as the formulation of solemn commitments to the principles and purposes that have guided and should continue to guide the future work of the United Nations . However , predictably , during the past year the purposes and principles that have guided us for over 50 years have once again undergone unilateral interpretation . 
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
First , in the health field , action is under way to reach the target of eliminating poliomyelitis ; salt iodization is being implemented ; the rate of maternal mortality has decreased from 143 in 1989 to 107 in 1995 for every 100,000 live births ; 93 per cent of all children have been vaccinated and immunized against hepatitis ; studies and evaluations have been made to supplement current child nutrition information ; and health plans have been drawn up to promote future health care .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
For our part , we have carefully analyzed our position in the light of the views expressed so far in the discussions and we will soon present our considerations in the form of an informal position paper , which will elaborate on our previously presented views concerning the most important aspects of the Security Council 's future , including one of the most difficult among them : the issue of the size of the Council and the allocation of newly created seats . 
We are committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations , which we hope will lead to real progress in fostering human and social capacity , in strengthening economic performance and in protecting the environment , thus laying firm foundations for a better future for all African people .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Even more recently , Africa signed the Pelindaba Treaty , making our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone , and thus making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the process of nuclear disarmament , which , in the context of ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty , has not gained the necessary impetus to preserve the future of mankind and to save succeeding generations from the nuclear scourge . 
I wish to recall that Australia supported resolution 50 / 70 F . We are concerned to ensure that SSOD IV is scheduled in such a way that it has adequate time to prepare and the best possible story to tell for example , to report a successfully concluded comprehensive test-ban treaty , and that the meeting itself provides a forward-looking framework for future concrete disarmament undertakings . 
On the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , my delegation shares the view set out in the Chairman 's paper that the special session will provide us with an opportunity to review the progress achieved thus far and to prepare better for the future , and that adequate and solid preparation is the key to ensuring a successful outcome .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .

At the Vienna Conference on human rights , the international community had recognized that human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and had charted a course of action in the field of human rights into the next century ; however , its attention and efforts must be focused on the implementation of all existing human rights instruments , not only so that the perpetrators of human rights violations could be condemned but so that the rule of law should be respected in the future . 
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .

To consider the information provided by the Governments on their respective military and security budgets for the current fiscal year and to elaborate joint proposals for the possible adaptation of future budgets , taking into account the internal situation of each State ;  
It combines the challenge of security for all the basic human need of a reliable supply of safe drinking water and meeting the competing demands from industry and agriculture , which are crucial to economic development and food security , without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their water needs .  
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
The most important challenges to continuous and sustainable development that humanity will face in the near future will be the provision of basic necessities , such as food , shelter , a clean and healthy environment and proper education , to the growing population of Earth .  
It may be recalled that the General Assembly , in its decision 49 / 483 of 12 July 1995 , decided that there would be set off against the apportionment among Member States , in respect of such future mandate period ( s ) as might be approved by the Security Council , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,755,000 gross ( $ 16,000 net ) for the period from 1 February 1994 to 31 January 1995 , inclusive .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
Once the resolution establishing an operation has been adopted , this unit , which may be reinforced as needed by the future commanders of the main national detachments , would ensure the overall military planning of the operation by preparing , in particular , a detailed military directive and the initial order of operations . 
This is important for a number of reasons already specified , among which may be highlighted the need to advance understanding of what sustainable development means in relationship to international law and the importance of certain " benchmark principles " for guiding the drafting of national legislation , the interpretation of existing law and negotiations of future international law . 
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
Since lasting democracy requires the solid foundation of law , the process of building a functioning judicial system and a professional civilian police force in Haiti is of paramount importance for the future of that country .  
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .

Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
As stated in its report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peace-keeping operation ( A / 49 / 664 , para . 36 ) , " performance reports are of critical importance not only in understanding what has happened , and what is happening , but also in arriving at a considered judgement as to what will be required in the future " .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
Egypt 's privatization policy changed in 1994 , moving away from outright sales of state enterprises towards more gradual disinvestment through the sale of shares in the country 's stock market and through long-term lease and management contracts .  Economic liberalization continued in the Syrian Arab Republic , but no major privatization is envisioned in the near future .  
A proper balance has to be struck between curative and preventive action : finding a remedy for the symptoms of past mismanagement while at the same time avoiding future calamities linked to societal driving forces .  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply . 
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
It stands against the letter and the spirit of the Armistice Agreement , recognized by the international community as the legal binding instrument to preserve stability on the Korean Peninsula until it will be replaced - hopefully in the near future - by a peaceful settlement agreed upon by all sides involved .  
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
The Organization will be a central actor in this respect for the foreseeable future , not simply because of its role within the international community , but also because Africa 's problems encompass political , economic , social and environmental dimensions that require the integrated approach that only the United Nations can provide .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
As long as the United States authorities do not impose a complete ban on these illegal flights , and as long as effective steps are not taken to prevent them , the United States will be completely responsible for any future incident ; it will be violating the most elemental norms of international law and international civil aviation and will continue to fail to comply , in particular , with the most relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention and the Montreal Protocol .  
It is widely acknowledged in Sarajevo that the joint international effort to keep essential utilities functioning and begin the restoration of the city 's physical infrastructure made a real difference by enabling the citizens of Sarajevo to survive , particularly during winter months , and by giving them hope for the future .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .

Also , while trying to reconstruct their economy and lay the foundations for their future State , the Palestinians were aware of the need for eventual integration into a larger economic context and developing mutually beneficial ties with countries of the Middle East , North Africa and the Mediterranean basin .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .

The major changes in the world , which have eliminated confrontation between blocs , have already had an impact on the situation in the Mediterranean region , where the outlines of a peaceful future are beginning to take shape : the Middle East peace process is proceeding , although with considerable difficulty ; the move towards peace in the Balkans is continuing ; and there is a growing understanding of the importance of establishing regional cooperation for economic growth and rescuing the environment of the Mediterranean basin . 
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
A number of quantitative parameters included in FAO 's periodic forest resources assessment and possible future national reports required under the Convention on Biological Diversity , the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Combating Desertification and the information collected for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ( CITES ) may potentially constitute such a core set .  
In areas where plantations are designed to achieve multiple purposes , especially for fulfilling subsistence needs of local populations , methodologies have to become more efficient and designed to reinforce the process of expanding forest cover .  NULLSeveral initiatives at the regional level have taken place or are planned for the near future in connection with improving the readiness to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
The Technical Meeting sought to move this evaluation process forward , giving emphasis to the necessary immediate and longer-term actions by focusing on four areas : evaluating alternative routes and their comparative costs ; considering bottlenecks in physical infrastructure and ways to remove them ; assessing non-physical barriers to the efficient use of the available transit transport corridors and steps to remove them ; and finally moving towards a framework for future cooperation .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their traditions and customs , as well as the law of the State concerned .

For the international regime for the storage and control of plutonium , the question for the near future is hardly whether or not to establish a full-fledged regime , but whether to prepare a legal framework and an option for countries to deposit fissile material when they deem that desirable , hence proceeding in a gradual , pragmatic fashion .  
With regard to the future work of the Special Committee , the draft declaration on the basic principles and criteria for the work of United Nations peacekeeping missions and mechanisms for the prevention and settlement of crises and conflicts submitted by the Russian Federation should be carefully studied in order to draw up a complete , precise and innovative text in an area which was so important for the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security .  
Participants in the high-level segment recognized that , in future work , more attention should be paid to addressing the driving forces that impacted on the sustainable management of natural resources while at the same time giving more attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development , including combating poverty .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that follow-up efforts should focus on how Governments comply with their obligation under international law to conduct full , independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions transmitted to them , with a view to clarifying the circumstances , identifying and prosecuting those responsible , granting compensation to the victims or their families and preventing future violations .  
It is the obligation of Governments to carry out exhaustive and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of the right to life , to identify , bring to justice and punish their perpetrators , to grant compensation to the victims or their families , and to take effective measures to avoid future recurrence of such violations .  The Special Rapporteur has noted that impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of violations of human rights , and , in particular , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
At the governmental level , the exercise of power in what were certainly crucial moments for the future of the country was gathered in the hands of the President of the Republic , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Defence and the National Security Council , while the other ministers in the Government were barely kept informed of Burundi 's request for foreign security assistance made at the 25 June Arusha Summit and supported by the Yaound Summit a dozen or so days later . 
The Special Rapporteur also deems it essential to set a timetable with the de facto authorities for the holding of free and fair legislative elections in the near future , with the active participation of the entire population of Burundi .  
Although in the past the delegations of Canada , New Zealand and Australia had maintained that the only element in the current methodology that could be considered a transparent and equitable measure of capacity to pay was net national income , they could accept the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions to base future scales on estimates of gross national product if it was part of a comprehensive set of methodological changes .  
The recommendation in paragraph 50 of the Committee 's report , to the effect that in future scales of assessment , all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum rate of 0.001 per cent , should be implemented as soon as possible .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
Thus , for example , Tunisian women have been encouraged to set up production enterprises in various sectors and have benefited from numerous opportunities giving them access to the highest responsibilities in administrative and decision-making circles , opening up the way for their participation in all consultative bodies dealing with national affairs and the people 's future , and to the fulfilment of their role in a civil society whose basis is the elimination of all forms of direct or indirect exclusion .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,970,718 United States dollars gross ( 1,718,168 dollars net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 ;  
The situation facing UNRWA in the last quarter of 1996 was untenable because its cash reserves had been depleted , and replenishment could only be effected by immediate payment of pledges already received ; further future deficits could no longer be absorbed because the Agency 's working capital would have been exhausted by the end of 1996 ;  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
Mr . MWAKAWAGO ( United Republic of Tanzania ) said that the international community was looking forward to the twenty-first century with a mixture of hope and despair : hope for the opportunities created by the liberalized and globalized markets of the future , and despair over the persisting high levels of poverty , especially in developing countries , which could undermine the advantages deriving from expanded markets and global partnership , unless the vicious cycle of poverty was broken and a process of economic recovery and growth was initiated .  
In that regard , it was not clear whether the reform of the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) that had been proposed by its Administrator focused on the level of resources or on the Programme 's efficiency , and he wondered whether that process would be reviewed by the Governing Council , and whether the Administrator 's initiative concerning the reform of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations was a personal initiative or was part of a review of the level of resources to be allocated to operational activities for development in future .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Employers found guilty of abusing domestic workers were liable to heavy sentences , including jail terms and corporal punishment , and were permanently barred from employing foreign domestic workers in the future .  
The establishment of adequate internal controls at an early stage was a key requirement which should be borne in mind for future peacekeeping missions , since it would provide reasonable assurance that financial and administrative matters were properly handled during the life of the mission .  
The report further noted that Africa 's future economic performance might be impeded by long-term structural constraints to development , such as high external indebtedness , unequal distribution of and access to resources , poorly developed institutions and low levels of human resource development .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
For all those reasons , and in view of its previous request for the strengthening of support to the Committee , made at its fourth session it expressed its willingness to be involved in future consultations with the Secretariat to ensure the optimal use of available resources and the effective performance of its functions , in the light of article 43 , paragraph 11 of the Convention .  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .  Can the historical realities which influenced the Council 's composition 50 years ago be paralleled or matched in any way by present contingencies ?  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
These fears were then exploited by extreme rightist organizations and neo _ Nazi cells , which directed the frustrations of a proportion of the region 's unemployed youth , lacking a social identity or prospects for the future , towards foreigners .  
Relevant information should also be provided on the progress achieved in the implementation of article 40 , any difficulties encountered and targets set for the future , as well as disaggregated data on the children concerned , inter alia by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , national , social and ethnic origin , offence and disposition made available .  
Finally , once the target has been identified , a plan of action needs to be developed to meet the objective ; section III thus gives an integrated presentation of ISWGNA work programmes , highlighting recent achievements and reviewing proposed priority areas for future work in the light of expressed country needs .  
The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space [ 5 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
First , a modern , fair and transparent personnel policy , in which placement and promotion played an important part , and the strict implementation of that policy were crucial determinants of the effective future performance of the Organization . The General Assembly , in resolution 47 / 226 , had urged the Secretary-General to improve all personnel policies , yet that requirement had still not been implemented .  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;

While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
\ x { f448 } RK ( Slovenia ) said that the Code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind would complement the functioning of the future international criminal court and also serve domestic legal systems by unifying the criminal law and practice concerning the crimes which were considered to be the most serious crimes under international law .  
The Secretariat could prepare draft final articles that established a procedure for revision of the future Code , defined the relationship between the latter , the draft statute of the international criminal court and international conventions or treaties , and prohibited the formulation of reservations with a view to ensuring the universality and integrity of the Code .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;

We think that it is necessary to establish the practice of convening regular meetings between the official representatives of these organizations , in order to exchange opinions on a future security model for Europe , to divide their responsibilities properly within the framework of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security in the OSCE region , and to elaborate relevant arrangements for coordinating their activities and decision-making .  
As a State that has completed the withdrawal of strategic nuclear missiles from its territory , we believe that it is extremely important to make joint efforts to lay the foundations for a firm and peaceful future for Europe .  
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
The Group of 77 and China were willing to consider the projected vacancy rates for the 1996-1997 biennium , with the following provisos : that the Secretary-General should not exceed those rates and should certify at the end of the biennium that all mandated programmes had been fully implemented ; that those rates had been accepted by the General Assembly on an exceptional basis , and should not set a precedent for any future budgets ; and that they should not be used to accommodate any additional unfunded mandates in the overall level of appropriations .

Ukraine had always supported the creation of an international criminal court and was ready to participate actively in the future work , in the hope that the international community would demonstrate enough political will to meet what was an historic challenge .

Also , the lenders usually demand security in the form of mortgages , fixed or floating charges over all the assets of the project , assignments of future receivables arising from the operation of the project , automatic deposit of an agreed part of those proceeds into a blocked account ( often outside the State where the project is located ) , governmental guarantees , or the ability to appoint a substitute in the event of default or inability of the project company to perform its obligations .

The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .  
The speedy commencement and rapid conclusion of good-faith negotiations to achieve nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , under strict and effective international control , in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the International Court of Justice , is of paramount importance to the future of the international community .

The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
The Sub-Commission , at its forty-eighth session , in its resolution 1996 / 30 , requested the Special Rapporteur to update the list of States which have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency with a view to its consideration by the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session , and requested him to submit final conclusions on the protection of human rights during states of emergency , together with specific recommendations as to how this question should be dealt with in the future .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
The Committee took note of the annual overview report of ACC , welcomed its new improved format , commended the Secretariat for a concise and well focused report , and requested that future reports be more analytical than descriptive .  
Similar reconvened sessions should in future be held in December of odd years to approve the initial programme budget for the following biennium and the final version of the programme budget for the biennium that is drawing to a close , and to deal with any related administrative or budgetary matters . 
Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
In order to increase the representation of women at the Professional level , FAO developed strategies to identify suitable female candidates and established a roster of international experts working in the area of women in development to be considered for future vacancies .  
We believe that the Albanian operation has set a significant precedent for potential future interventions by the international community in cases where a State is gripped by a complex crisis with serious humanitarian implications and political repercussions for its neighbours .  
The General Assembly acknowledged that " to maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide " ( A / S-19 / 29 , annex , para .  39 ) .  
If in the near future an assessment , even preliminary , of the danger level for the climate system was successfully concluded , it would be easier to adopt a political decision regarding quantitative targets on reduction and elimination of greenhouse gases and to consider the outline of a protocol or other legal document containing the obligations of the parties to the Convention beyond the year 2000 .  
His Government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the global climate and conserving biological diversity for present and future generations and felt that the international community should recognize that , to preserve the planet , global willingness to tackle the task was essential ; if action was delayed , the cost could be devastating . 
Recognizing , however , the importance of agricultural development no only for people living in rural areas but as an engine of growth , the Bank had formulated during the past year a new action plan for rural development , designed to address current problems and to provide a new and dynamic framework for future Bank activities in that area .  The plan had just been presented to the Bank 's Board of Directors .  
In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
The Economic and Social Council also decided that similar reconvened sessions should in future be held in December of odd years to approve the initial programme budget for the following biennium and the final version of the programme budget for the biennium that is drawing to a close , and to deal with any related administrative or budgetary matters .  * E / CN . 7 / 1997 / 1 .  
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
These populations , sometimes held hostage by armed groups bent on genocide for which an international criminal court has been set up have in turn been massacred in circumstances that need to be brought to light so that a different future can be forged .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Nonetheless , it wishes to express its concern that , in light of the considerable social and economic problems facing the country , insufficient efforts are being taken by the State party to devise preventive strategies to ensure that such problems do not become more prevalent , thereby endangering future generations of children .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
In view of the continuing widespread violations of human rights in Kosovo as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the opening of an office of the High Commissioner in Prishtina , as well as an increased presence of other international organizations , would be indispensable for gathering reliable information on future human rights developments .  
These were further compounded by growing hunger , sickness , unemployment , illiteracy , the eruption of violence and terrorism , illicit drug and arms trafficking , environmental degradation , and continued violations of human rights which gravely imperil our common future .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
The informed assessment of these contemporary hazards , effective risk management , and the prevention of future disasters must begin at the present time and be fully incorporated into the ongoing commitments of economic growth and developmental planning - at the international , regional , and national levels of responsibility .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Women workers are covered by social security , towards which the employer pays the equivalent of 10 per cent of her total monthly pay , while she pays 5 per cent to the social security fund as a guarantee for her future should she suffer an occupational disease or be incapacitated for work or retire from a government post .  
His delegation supported the recommendations contained in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the report concerning the continuing relevance and importance of the principle of a low per capita income adjustment , and it agreed to the Committee 's proposal that the future scale of assessments should be based on gross national product .  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
In general , it planned to focus on strategic policy formulation and the broad issues facing the common system , with a view to shaping the international civil service of the future .  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Thus , in the light of this mandatory requirement for future peacekeeping operations , the Member States that have already pledged to the standby arrangements system may wish to exchange in advance data required by annexes A , B and C to the Memorandum of Understanding on contingent-owned equipment ( A / 51 / 967 ) , within the framework of the standby arrangements system .  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
Lastly , we would like to place on record that we joined in the consensus on this resolution on the understanding that any negotiating exercise that may take place in the immediate future must ensure that a requisite and necessary balance be struck between humanitarian concerns and the legitimate security interests of the States concerned .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
Given the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entire international community for the future of the planet , the Organization certainly needs to be renewed in order to confront effectively and successfully the exciting yet disturbing challenges posed by globalization .  
Since recovering its territory and water under the peace treaty signed with Israel in October 1994 , Jordan has maintained its pivotal role in the process and continued its efforts with the other parties to achieve the desired goals of establishing a just , comprehensive and lasting peace which will be accepted , preserved and protected by future generations .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
The debate and negotiations that took place during the three sessions of the Working Group held in 1997 covered , in a balanced way , the substantive and diverse issues included in both clusters , and demonstrated the complexity of this process of reform which , despite opposing interests , the vast majority of Member States hope will produce a Security Council that represents the current composition of the Organization and effectively responds to the future challenges of the United Nations .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
Convinced that economic growth can be achieved only if accompanied by increasing levels of sustainable development , the Central American countries wish to inform the international community of our decision to move forward resolutely towards a common future , a future of great progress and solidarity for our peoples .  
Despite the fact that two of three agenda items were in the initial stages of discussions , the working groups on those two items have laid a solid foundation for their future work , and the interim documents compiled on subject issues reveal a serious intention on the part of delegations to elaborate comprehensive and practical recommendations .  
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
Glaciers are melting ; forests are retreating ; we are changing the seasons ; we are running out of fish in the sea ; we are poisoning our children with persistent organic pollutants ; and we are accumulating nuclear waste to the peril of future generations .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
As regards future prospects , the Government of Russia recalled the importance of combined efforts of concerned States and international organizations and called for steps to raise standards in human rights and minorities protection , to consolidate civil society and national harmony and promote tolerance and mutual respect among all strata of the population - ultimately for the good of democracy , the supremacy of law , and stability .  
Projections regarding future water demand and availability are highly uncertain , being dependent on assumptions about population and economic growth , investment in additional water supply , relative demand from different consuming sectors , the development and adoption of new technologies and the extent to which existing supplies become contaminated .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
We , the representatives of the Serbian ethnic community , are convinced that in the sense of the aforementioned we have not even hypothesized a possibility of diminishing or limiting the relevant civil rights of the present and future inhabitants of the region under the Transitional Administration in the Republic of Croatia .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .  
This initiative , supported by the Government of Jordan , is designed to create a community of potential future leaders who have shared a common training experience in global issues .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
By its decision 51 / 406 of 17 October 1996 , the General Assembly decided that , for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross ( $ 1,718,168 net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 should be set off against future assessments .  
Regarding the future status of the leader of UNITA as the President of the largest opposition party , Mr . Savimbi , shortly after his return from South Africa on 8 January 1997 , proposed that he be granted the status of principal adviser to the President of the Republic , with a substantive coordinating role in the spheres of rural development and national reconciliation , as well as supervisory powers over several ministries .  
Having had the privilege of meeting with a wide variety of brilliant people in Turkey and having seen the horrendous pain and needless suffering stemming from the tragedy that terrorism today imposes on this country of limitless potential , the Special Rapporteur is convinced that the safeguarding of the right to freedom of opinion and expression by the Government and the support for such a policy by society as a whole have the potential to become the foundation for the building of a peaceful , prosperous and just future for Turkey . 
Requests the International Civil Service Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the United Nations common system , including consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
The emergence of an active biochemical prospecting market can provide an additional means of converting the potential future value of biodiversity into current income for those most responsible for , and most affected by , the preservation of biologically diverse ecosystems .  
However , the Inspectors considered that examination of the issues in the report was timely since they believed that a modern , fair , and transparent personnel policy , of which placement and promotion were an important part , and its strict implementation , were crucial determinants of effective future performance of the United Nations .  
Regarding data processing and archiving , the Subcommittee noted that to fully exploit the potential of already acquired and future research data , more international cooperation was needed for their proper archiving , to ensure global free access to databases , to develop mechanisms for improving access to meta-data , and to agree on formats and software packages for data conversion that were necessary for scientific research .  
Given the limited capacity of the judiciary , the lack of knowledge about national legislation among the population , and the lack of resources to make use of the court system , the large majority of the population will in practical terms have their legal status defined within the framework of traditional systems in the foreseeable future .  
As the distinction was difficult to apply in practice , the Commission should in the future base its work on any given topic on international conventions and custom and the recognized principles of law and should then proceed to consider what contributions to progressive development might be acceptable to the international community .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
It is therefore clear that if there is to be genuine improvement in the disturbing situation in the former Sectors , efforts by both international and local organizations to promote confidence and reconciliation will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future .  1 International observers had estimated the total number of killings which had taken place in the former Sectors in circumstances unrelated to the military actions of August 1995 to be at least 120 ( see S / 1995 / 1051 ) .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
WHO envisages future activities in the northern Caucasus region which are of primary importance , including projects aimed at the control of communicable diseases in the region , in particular vaccine preventable diseases , acute diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis , and mental health assistance .  [ 1 ] / Available for consultation in the Secretariat .  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
The pace of future movements is inhibited by three main factors : legal and financial obstacles to the recovery of property ; unrealistic government deadlines for Serb applications for reconstruction assistance and delays in government funding for reconstruction of Serb houses ; and the uncertain economic and social situation in areas of potential return .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
According to article III of its Memorandum and Articles of Association , the main objectives of the Centre are to develop well researched policy options on land reform , rural development and agricultural reform to influence the policies of a future administration ; to facilitate the analysis of existing policies and alternative policy proposals relating to this sector ; to provide options for the reorientation of policy-making towards a democratic order ; to collect data and develop and manage a comprehensive information system concerning land and agricultural issues and including all existing research .  
A simple step in this direction would be to record in a succinct and simple form the principal lessons learned from Habitat 's experience over the last five years in at least two of the main areas in which Habitat will be active in the foreseeable future and then see whether the lessons learned have improved the quality of programme and projects design and implementation .  
They had urged the development of Israeli / Palestinian / NGO cooperation , based on mutual understanding and commitment to a comprehensive , just and lasting peace , and had pledged to generate public support for the Palestinian people through campaigns focusing on the themes of the future of Jerusalem , Israeli settlements and their expansion in East Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza , and the Palestinian refugees ' right of return .  
We are especially pleased that the United Nations accepted our invitation to host this most important forum which is so critical to an international understanding of the dynamics of the contemporary self-determination process and future advancement of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in our region and beyond .  
Nonetheless , it wishes to express its concern that , in light of the considerable social and economic problems facing the country , insufficient efforts are being taken by the State party to devise preventive strategies to ensure that such problems do not become more prevalent , thereby endangering future generations of children .  
In light of the Committees view that further efforts are required to ensure that the Convention is used as a political tool and a framework for action on behalf of children , the Committee recommends that future national and local programmes of action on children incorporate policies , programmes , aims and goals reflecting the principles and provisions of the Convention .  
As planned , the Task Force produced a synthesis report for use by the resident coordinator system , summarizing lessons of experience at the country level and across countries with a view to suggesting ways of improving inter-agency collaboration in the future and providing a clear understanding of the different ingredients that work for the promotion of employment and sustainable livelihoods in specific situations and of the necessary indicators for monitoring progress in these areas .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
However , as the representative of Zaire arrived in New York expecting to present the State party 's initial report , the Committee instead agreed that the representative of Zaire would make an oral report on an exceptional basis on the situation of women in Zaire . The Committee agreed on the understanding that the regular report of Zaire would be rescheduled for consideration by the Committee at a future date .  
The GM would pursue two elements in this regard : ( i ) information on current and future aggregate flows will be collected from recipients and sources ; and ( ii ) information on potential sources of finance , and how to access these , will be packaged for easy use by customers .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
Members will recall that , on the occasion of that historic event , the debate about our common future was often polarized into the choice between rural sustainability and urban migration , between the green agenda and the brown agenda , between developed and developing economies .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .  
Our overriding and ultimate concern is to ensure a clean and safe planet that is hospitable and friendly to human life , now and in the future .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
Efforts should be made by the international community and intergovernmental bodies and organizations to establish cooperative relations with the authorities in Afghanistan in order to assist in the eradication of illicit cultivation , production and trafficking of narcotic drugs , especially in the drug-producing areas of the country , and to provide them with packages of aid and the means of economic reform , such as human development and capacity-building , mobilization of resources and industrial development to enable them to resort to alternative sources of income , which would provide better economic possibilities for future generations ;  
Cases referred to included : the Hungarian minority in Slovakia , where in schools of the national minorities , history and geography was taught by ethnic Slovak teachers , which allegedly led to a distortion of historical truth and thus negatively affected future generations of Hungarians learning about their own past ( Federal Union of European Nationalities ) ; the Arab minority in Israel , where educational guidelines and policies were designed to entrench the values of the Jewish culture , and the characteristics of the identity of the Palestinian minority were suppressed .  
In order to facilitate the review of the progress in the development of transit systems by the above mentioned meeting of governmental experts convened pursuant to paragraph 11 of General Assembly 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD made arrangements , with the financial support of the UNDP , to undertake comprehensive regional and subregional analytical studies which highlighted recent developments on the transit transport sector of land-locked and transit developing countries and made recommendations for future action .  
At the operational level , the United Nations Special Commission has continued its tasks of verifying the destruction of Iraq 's proscribed weapons and capabilities and of operating a system of ongoing monitoring of its compliance with its obligation not to acquire such weapons or capabilities in the future ( see S / 1997 / 301 , annex ) .  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
What was needed was an innovative , effective and lasting approach , based on a common set of principles for future debt negotiations , which would include arrangements for a substantial reduction of all categories of debt .  
In the light of this evidence , the Government of Cuba feels it has a moral obligation to alert the international community once again to the dangers threatening the future and stability of international relations if effective steps are not taken to eliminate the proliferation of measures such as this blockade , which , besides affecting the well-being and health of a people , attempts to limit the sovereignty of other States and to ignore the growing call throughout the world that it be lifted .  
For the purposes of realizing the will of the people and their right to self-determination , creating a responsible Government , preventing a monopoly of power and administrative corruption , electing representatives to the electoral bodies , ensuring free and fair periodical election of the leadership ; the principles of democracy and pluralism shall constitute the mainspring of the future political system to be formed in Afghanistan .  
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
Only the Organization , as a universal body , could take up in an integrated and coherent manner those vital problems which created an unequal world and determined a bleak future for hundreds of millions of people .  
The Economic and Social Council also decided that similar reconvened sessions should in future be held in December of odd years to approve the initial programme budget for the following biennium and the final version of the programme budget for the biennium that is drawing to a close , and to deal with any related administrative or budgetary matters .  
The International Monitoring Committee and MISAB were invited to participate in a special commission , beginning on 5 October , in seeking a viable and satisfactory solution to the transfer of the school for the children being raised by the Army to an appropriate site with a view to settling the delicate question of this group of young people in the Central African Republic , which is a breeding ground for future members of the Armed Forces . It should be mentioned that some of the children attending the school had joined the ranks of the rebels . 
Funds received or pledges recorded as receivable , attributable to future financial periods and , therefore , not credited to the income account of the period reported on .  
Although these States are responsible for their future , the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africa demand a multilateral response to the political , economic and social ills of the region , and the need to address development issues is paramount .  
At that Summit they decided on the challenges of development in Latin America in the coming years and identified the main urban problems that will be the subject of future joint activity .  
There is considerable agreement on the conceptual content of the right to adequate food , including relevant health and nutrition aspects , and future efforts in this regard need to be directed primarily at fine-tuning existing concepts .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
Both plants will be subjected , in the immediate future , to a detailed technical evaluation by the original suppliers to identify the most efficient and effective way to restore their capacity to an acceptable level of availability and reliability .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
Developing the capability to understand and predict the social and economic impact of existing practices ( technological , social , economic and cultural ) that might be detrimental to future generations and national economic / social systems ;  
The growing space industry and the many associated service and scientific organizations require a steady flow of enthusiastic , trained and competent young engineers and scientists to meet the challenges of the future .  
A substantive discussion of the specific issues and implications arising from the study was beyond the scope of the Panel 's deliberations , although it recognized the key importance of fundamental economic principles in determining the future of forests .  
The forward rate would be free to differ from the current spot rate and a growing forward discount on the spot exchange rate ( assuming interest rates remained unchanged ) would be an indication of expected future depreciation of the spot rate .  
The Committee decided that in the future it would meet in private half an hour before starting consideration of a country report , in order to pinpoint the main problems to be addressed during public discussion .  
The Conference should examine the psychological , social , political and economic factors that made individuals receptive to racism , in view of forecasts concerning future ethnic and racial conflict .  
The complex issues raised by migration should be addressed in a constructive manner in order to build a future of tolerance and mutual understanding and to dispel the very real fears associated with the phenomenon .  
By adopting the Statute of a permanent , independent , effective , transparent and non-selective international criminal court , the Conference would be leaving an enduring legacy to future generations .  
While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
They support exchanges and cooperation , including joint projects , in basic and applied scientific research as well as in areas of research and development with potential for the development of modern society and sustainable economic growth in the future .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
The remarkable thrust of activity at the upstream level is indicative of the potential role of the different components of civil society in national policy-making in the short to medium-term future .  
The Board recognized the threat posed by rapid technological innovation in future warfare and was keen on pursuing some of the consequent policy implications for the United Nations system .  
In order to train these units for future missions , the countries members of the Committee have agreed to organize joint military exercises in connection with mock peacekeeping operations , scheduled to be held in south-western Gabon in 1999 .  
It also recommended adopting the 20 / 20 concept of mutual commitment for basic social programmes , providing youth with a secure and healthy future , and supporting efforts for capacity-building for human development .  
A document entitled Education for a viable future in the Americas is being prepared , which reflects international thinking on the subject , following the meeting on that theme organized by UNESCO in Thessaloniki , Greece , in December 1997 .  
As requested by the participants , the future parliament would only be composed of democratically elected representatives designated by central African States where free and fair elections are held .  
The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
My country also highlighted the great importance of fostering sustainable development , whose objective is to harmonize human activities and nature by means of policies and actions that will achieve an efficient and fair economy , a just society and the preservation of the environment , in order to ensure a better quality of life for present and future generations in a safe environment .  
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
As a future venue and a focal point for the Mine Ban Convention and the various activities in the field of mine action that it will produce , Geneva would offer a wide variety of diplomatic and technical expertise , a broad representation of diplomatic missions and humanitarian agencies and relevant non _ governmental organizations , including ICRC , WHO , UNHCR and the newly established Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining .  
These two agreements and their follow _ up mechanisms provide a comprehensive response to the problems posed by anti _ personnel landmines , although the complete removal of the millions of mines scattered around the world will regrettably continue to be one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of the international community for the foreseeable future .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
We also welcome the determined and energetic position of Ms . Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , who has understood perfectly the magnitude of our responsibility to future generations and the vital importance of protecting children as one of the sectors whose vulnerability puts in jeopardy the very existence of the human race on our blue planet . 
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently gathering statistics provided by Member States contributing personnel so as to provide data on the participation of women in their military and civilian police establishments , in order to have a better understanding of the potential to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping in the foreseeable future .  
It had been observed , for example , that Governments should have been more involved from the very beginning of the process , including in the preparation of the common country assessments ; that a way must be found to involve civil society and non-governmental organizations ; and that UNDAF should be introduced gradually , so that experience could be absorbed as the process unfolded , and the lessons learned could be applied to the planning of future activities .  
The Working Group agreed that a future draft of subparagraph ( b ) should reflect the changes discussed : notice should be given without undue delay ; the two standards of knew or ought to have known and is or might have been compromised should be included in square brackets as alternative texts ; and the words and could be used to create unauthorized enhanced electronic signatures should be deleted .  
In short , the Office of the High Commissioner is gearing up for the challenges of the future with principled commitment , rational and efficient managerial practices , new methods , and renewed energy from its staff throughout - as will be seen in the ensuing sections .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
There was no point in speaking of sustainable development when some countries members of the Forum faced the prospect of being submerged by the sea in the not too distant future , and atolls were being polluted by nuclear tests .  
The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
In the state policy document on demography and the national programme on improving the status of women , there have been put forward a cluster of objectives to pursue activities aimed at supporting the family well-being , developing a Mongolian family and household study , passing on to the younger generation respect for national traditions , preserving the genetic pool of Mongolians , and preparing children for future independent life , labour , and equal participation of men and women in family .  
Governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with women , youth and children carry out many activities aimed not only at preserving humane traditions practised in Mongolian families and inherited from our ancestors , including reverence and care of parents , support for the poor , and respect for elderly and pregnant women , but also at enriching them in new settings and passing them on to future generations . 
Reaffirm that the central decision _ making role in determining the content of the regional technical cooperation programme , evaluating the progress achieved and determining actions to be taken under the programme in the future will continue to be played by the annual intergovernmental workshop with the assistance of the open-ended team in Geneva comprising Geneva _ based representatives of the Governments of the Asian-Pacific region ;  
Prompt and decisive action was needed to halt the decline in living standards in countries which had fallen prey to the global financial crisis , and Governments must enact policies to expand economic opportunities quickly for disadvantaged households and communities , and make them less vulnerable to future shocks .  
In particular , fast and balanced growth was urgently needed in the heavily indebted countries of sub-Saharan Africa , where the future of innumerable families was literally mortgaged in order to service loans from bilateral institutions , private banks and international organizations .  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
With international technical assistance , the populations living standards are being enhanced , ecosystems are now better protected and managed , and efforts are being made to ensure a more secure and prosperous future .  
The General Assembly should take a position on the future pledging mechanism , either in a separate resolution or as part of its general decision on the triennial policy review ; Ukraine supported the establishment of such a mechanism provided that the universal , voluntary and grant nature of United Nations operational activities was maintained .  
The primary objective of the unit will be to promote respect for human rights and compliance with minimum humanitarian standards , and to deter massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Mr . Nesho ( Albania ) : The moment that we are going through is a historic moment for the future of the Balkans , as the international community is intervening in order to stop the humanitarian catastrophe and the tragedy of a nation whose people have been tortured , killed and buried in common graves , a nation that is justly demanding its legitimate rights to freedom and to its very existence undeniable rights for all peoples .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , the future legal regime of the geostationary orbit should not be described in advance as a sui generis regime , since that status would depend on the rules and principles agreed upon .  
The alternative approach that was suggested ( i.e . , the inclusion of an open-ended provision describing such financial practices in sufficiently broad terms to cover existing practices and future developments ) was found to be impractical in view of the difficulty of describing a wide range of heterogeneous and rapidly changing practices with sufficient precision .  
They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .  
Nevertheless , it is evident that the long-term future of the Base will depend not only on the future level of peacekeeping operations ( new , ongoing and liquidating missions ) , but also on the extent to which the Base can be used to manage other assets of the United Nations , the specialized agencies , funds and programmes , as well as the extent to which its potential for training and communications services is increased .  
The status of IAEA verification activities in Iraq is unchanged from that reported in document S / 1999 / 127 , which was provided as a summary document to facilitate the work of the panel on disarmament and current and future ongoing monitoring and verification issues established pursuant to document S / 1999 / 100 of 30 January 1999 . 
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
While ongoing efforts to reform the international financial architecture and improve economic management will reduce the risks of future crises , there is growing recognition of the need to proceed , in parallel , with efforts to strengthen social policies and institutions , including industrial relations systems and institutions for social dialogue .  
Having committed themselves to a domestically based strategy to achieving more balanced growth , reducing imbalances and supporting recovery in emerging market economies , the Group also pledged strong cooperation to promote stability of the international monetary system and announced the launching of a financial stability forum to help avert future global crisis . 
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
No firm decision as regards a possible future four-year periodicity of amendments should be taken during the period of alignment of the format of the various legal instruments concerning modal aspects of the transport of dangerous goods on that of the model regulations , and pending decisions regarding the implementation of the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals in accordance with Agenda 21 objectives ;  
As indicated in the Secretary-Generals report on human resources management ( A / 53 / 342 ) , the purpose of career development is to build and maintain a highly competent , multi-skilled and versatile international civil service capable of meeting the Organizations present and future needs and , in so doing , to meet the development needs and career aspirations of individual staff members .  
Recognizes that the elections held on 7 March 1999 were organized and conducted in a peaceful and calm atmosphere but takes note with concern that some flaws and irregularities were observed during the electoral process , and therefore calls upon the Government of Equatorial Guinea to continue the dialogue with all political parties and to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the national electoral commission , so as to guarantee fair , transparent and democratic conditions in the future ;  
That while this review should be addressed as a matter of urgent necessity , it is also a process which needs to be conducted in a careful , detailed , inclusive and integrated manner , thus requiring recommendations from the working group about possible future time _ frames , to be included in its progress report to the Commission at its fifty _ sixth session ;  
Emphasizes that mediation and restorative justice measures can lead to satisfaction for victims as well as to the prevention of future illicit behaviour and can represent a viable alternative to short terms of imprisonment and to fines , which are in certain cases practically impossible to collect ;  
Reaffirms that juvenile justice remains a high priority in the work of the Centre for International Crime Prevention and the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , in particular as children and young people , both those in conflict with the law and those in difficult circumstances who may be potential future criminals , are easy prey for criminal organizations closely linked with activities of transnational organized crime ;  
The Council expressed its appreciation of the numerous dmarches and tireless and effective endeavours of President Yasser Arafat at Arab and international levels , which have produced qualitative developments in the position of every State in the world with respect to the State of Palestine , have established that State 's international legitimacy ever more firmly and have advanced its current and future relations .  
Responding to questions by the representatives of Japan and Pakistan on the date of issuance of the administrative instruction on procedures for appointing type II gratis personnel in future , he confirmed that all offices and departments had been made fully aware of the mandate to phase out all such personnel by 28 February 1999 ; the Secretariat had decided to concentrate on meeting that mandatory deadline rather than on issuing instructions on how gratis personnel could be engaged .  
No provision of this Convention shall be construed as preventing the States Parties from engaging in mutual cooperation within the framework of other international agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral , currently in force or concluded in the future , or pursuant to any other applicable arrangement or practice .  
Establishment of a subsidiary body to Main Committee I of Review Conferences , and the provision of specific time at all future meetings of Preparatory Committees , for a structured opportunity to deliberate on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
d ) Establishment of a subsidiary body to Main Committee I of Review Conferences , and the provision of specific time at all future meetings of Preparatory Committees , for a structured opportunity to deliberate on the practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons .  
However , it is possible to ( i ) take stock of recent trends relevant to this issue , ( ii ) identify some key issues requiring immediate international attention , and ( iii ) outline possible priority areas for future work on the relationship between electronic commerce , globalization and development .  
Spains administrative , academic and scientific institutions have attained a high level of scientific and technical development and the necessary capabilities to ensure that the present role of remote sensing as a powerful tool in environmental management will be strengthened in the near future .  
It is essential that this future body , whose governing board will comprise the various sectors of civil society involved and whose role will be of key importance in developing space sciences within the country and in familiarizing coming generations with the issues of sustainable socio-economic development , should be strengthened as from its establishment through the cooperation of Member States .  
This , I presume , will require a balanced approach , susceptible to reconciling enlightened pragmatism with the ideals that have inspired the creation of this forum _ first and foremost , the achievement of a nuclear _ weapon _ free world in the not _ so _ distant future .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their laws , traditions and customs .  
However , she made an oral presentation at that session , in which she highlighted the essential elements of her study , discussed her ideas on the purpose , scope , sources and structure of her future report , and expressed her wish to elaborate on them further in the framework of a substantial preliminary report , to be submitted to the Sub-Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
Firstly , international cooperation in the collection , collation and interpretation of observations of near-Earth objects is essential for early assessment of the tiny , but real risk of a potentially devastating impact in the foreseeable future and to refine the precise computations needed for any mitigation measures in case a significant danger of an impact were to be substantiated .  
It opposed and rejected outright the efforts of the negotiators at the Rambouillet conference and all other forms of diplomatic intervention , even though , after lengthy negotiations , the political settlement envisaged at Rambouillet laid out a future for Kosovo .  
The major policy recommendations in the area of social development include enhanced budgetary allocations for social services , establishment of a formal social fund , targeting of measures related to employment creation , cash transfers , free or subsidized provision of essential goods and services and credit facilities in the short term , introduction of an effective system of unemployment insurance , and revision of development strategies to minimize vulnerability to crises in the future .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly called for reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter that indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories .  
Countries today , especially developing countries , need to be capable of assimilating technological progress through an understanding of the present and its projection into the future , by formulating appropriate strategies to close the technology gap with the more advanced nations and thus avoid being overtaken by events .  
Its membership has been growing day by day and civil society has begun to identify with it as a solid basis for the hope that nuclear disarmament efforts may prove successful in the future if they take the form of firm , practical and effective steps , as reflected in General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 Y .  
Conditions of increasing social and economic vulnerability will almost certainly lead to unprecedented natural and related hazards in the future , so specific recommendations are made to ensure continued advocacy , the development of policies and the coordination of institutionalized abilities into the twenty-first century .  
On the one hand , changes in the need for disaster reduction will be determined by the changing patterns of natural hazards , their future potential for association with technological disasters or political conflicts , and shifts in the socio-economic and demographic trends .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
In addition , these contradictions place a formidable burden on the formulation and realization of future negotiated legal instruments between indigenous peoples and States : the difficulties of negotiating those new instruments without having previously identified and settled key questions need not be stressed .  
Having completed his research , the Special Rapporteur considers that it may be useful to review the above list , so as to determine - at least provisionally - what would be the most practical and fruitful means ( i.e . treaty / agreement renegotiation and / or proper implementation , constructive arrangement , resort to international bodies , or some other formula ) of constructively approaching , in the future , the wide array of current situations confronting those peoples mentioned above .
