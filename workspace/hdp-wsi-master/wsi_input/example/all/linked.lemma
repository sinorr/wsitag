The experience he has acquired over eight years prompts the Special Rapporteur to assert that situations involving , for example , armed conflict , terrorism , or violence linked to extremist intolerance foster a growing reliance on the use of mercenaries , which for our purposes means seeking out foreign experts who are paid for services of destructive violence and deadly effectiveness .  
Considering the priority that African Governments are giving to achieve economic growth and sustainable development , considering also the challenge of growing criminality , both national and transnational , it is imperative that all measures that are being taken to achieve sustainable development are linked with crime prevention and criminal justice .

Refuting the so-called reliable sources of the Special Rapporteur as being linked to other States or in the pay of the United States secret services , the representative of Iraq said that the accusations concerning the violation of the political and civil rights of the Iraqi population by means of laws imposing cruel and inhuman penalties , which those sources had reported , were totally groundless since those laws had been repealed , as the Centre for Human Rights and other international bodies could confirm .  
In order to move towards the identification of mechanisms for improving coordination , it was recommended that the United Nations Statistics Division convene a second meeting of the Expert Group to consider three topics : ( i ) a network of classifications : the conceptual linkages ; ( ii ) coordinating mechanisms in a setting of linked and interrelated classifications ; and ( iii ) social statistics : where do they fit into the picture ?

While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development , rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment , particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
In Gambia , for example , the 1994 Act on Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides Control and Management contains a provision that international notification schemes relating to chemicals and pesticides , including the prior informed consent procedures , are to be implemented . 94 Some other examples of national legal implementation of the principle of prior consultation are directly linked to regulations regarding environmental impact assessment procedures .

Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
My delegation is delighted to see the Chair of the CD occupied by a representative of Romania , a country with which Poland is linked by traditional bonds of friendship , which _ as confirmed during the recent visit of the President of Romania , Emil Constantinescu , to Warsaw _ is firmly based on shared values and aspirations .  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades .

As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
Many indigenous representatives expressed the view that the forum should be established as a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council , while other indigenous representatives considered that it should be linked to the Economic and Social Council , in one way or another , although they were not in a position to identify the exact placement in the system at the current time .

Some are threatened by uncontrolled development of the economic activities they help to sustain ; others by introduced species of animals and plants ; still others by changing conditions such as rising sea temperature linked to global warming .  
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
ESCWAs mainstream activities in the population , social and women-related areas are being linked with the programmed activities outlined in a three-year extrabudgetary flagship project on integrated follow-up to global conferences , which was formulated by ESCWA and supported by UNDP to forge a regional link for Arab States between the global vision and national endeavours to pursue the recommendations of global conferences .

The spirit of the instruments would seem to be clear : the right to education principally concerns personal development , but in cases where this personal development is itself linked to the quality of the relational fabric that the person is able to weave with his or her peers , this fundamental right necessarily takes on a universal dimension , since social or national communities can no longer exist and develop in isolation .  
In 1982 , the Basic People 's Congresses ( the legislative mechanism ) approved the new educational structure with a view to redesigning the educational system by introducing technical and artistic education linked with vocational training at the basic and intermediate stages , the aim being to meet the needs of the national economy for a workforce with technical and vocational qualifications .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
That combination could only be created and maintained for so long because of the perverse mechanism that linked it to external markets ( in the northern states of the USA , by contrast , slavery never took a hold because the ecological conditions for export crops based on plantations were absent ) .  
Despite positive developments linked to the creation of the PA and removal of restrictions from the occupation period , economic activities were adversely affected and the interim period has been characterized by prolonged decline in the standard of living , with high and fluctuating unemployment .

The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
A major development in relation to the HIPC initiative had been the Cologne debt initiative ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 44 ) , which linked debt relief to poverty reduction , and aimed at deepening and quickening debt reduction through a reduction in debt sustainability thresholds ; a deeper degree of cancellation ; interim relief ; floating completion points ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 46 ) ; and , as a result , an increase in the number of countries expected to be eligible for debt relief .

In the light of the fact that lasting peace , independence and freedom were inextricably linked to social and economic development , there was a need to consider the unique circumstances prevailing in the Non-Self-Governing Territories , such as vulnerability to natural disasters , fragility of ecosystems , geographical isolation and the need to protect the cultural traditions of local populations .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .

The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;

Proclaiming its agreement to the talks , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , however , in the light of the opening paragraphs of the document , is surprised by the notion expressed in the unnumbered third paragraph , namely that the lack of positive results in bringing about an Afghan settlement is linked to the determination of the warring Afghan sides to settle the conflict solely by military means .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .

During the recent financial turmoil in Asia , the Government of the HKSAR , with its stable public finances and healthy fiscal reserves , has formulated on its own appropriate measures to deal with the problem and has successfully maintained the stability of the linked exchange rate .  Hong Kong continues to prosper and maintain its status as a leading international shipping , trade , financial and business centre .  
First and foremost because for years we have practised very prudent sound financial policies .

Further , in contrast to the implicit , but ultimately unsustainable exchange rate guarantees , or exchange control measures , elsewhere in the region , we have an explicit linked exchange rate system , maintained through a strict rule-based currency board system and fully backed by some of the largest official reserves in the world , for a currency that is required by law to be freely convertible .

Often linked to other criminal activities such as the illegal arms trade , drug trafficking and money laundering , terrorism knew no boundaries , and no one State was safe against it ; effective and concerted international cooperation was therefore essential . 
The Administration notes that a number of measures have been taken that are in line with this recommendation : the numeric control system for LOAs has been developed and linked to the financial database to ensure that an appropriate obligating document is prepared in connection with every LOA ; miscellaneous obligating documents ( MODs ) are obligated at Headquarters and the field is provided with a monthly allotment report that reflects the disbursements and obligations against the MODs ; the modified text of LOAs now includes reference to receiving and inspection reports to facilitate identification .  
In spite of the continued existence of certain discriminatory attitudes linked to negative aspects of the traditional culture , women in Burundi benefited from a legal framework enabling them to reach their potential in society , notwithstanding the state of war which still paralysed the country .  Burundian women 's associations had done much to promote the emancipation of women .  
Refuting the so-called reliable sources of the Special Rapporteur as being linked to other States or in the pay of the United States secret services , the representative of Iraq said that the accusations concerning the violation of the political and civil rights of the Iraqi population by means of laws imposing cruel and inhuman penalties , which those sources had reported , were totally groundless since those laws had been repealed , as the Centre for Human Rights and other international bodies could confirm .  
In order to move towards the identification of mechanisms for improving coordination , it was recommended that the United Nations Statistics Division convene a second meeting of the Expert Group to consider three topics : ( i ) a network of classifications : the conceptual linkages ; ( ii ) coordinating mechanisms in a setting of linked and interrelated classifications ; and ( iii ) social statistics : where do they fit into the picture ? 
The fastest promotions were not always linked to competence and efficiency : recent times had witnessed a drastic curtailment of the promotions of male staff members as they had increasingly come up against stiff female competition buttressed by comprehensive preferential measures .  
Belgium is in favour of the adoption of a binding instrument which , supplementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child , would have the effect of compelling the signatory States to rank practices linked to the sexual exploitation of children as penal offences , so that they can be punished under criminal law .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
Today it is universally accepted that sustainable development could be attained if it were approached in a comprehensive manner , and that sustained economic growth is closely linked with social development and environmental protection .  
Copper prices , additionally , lost considerable ground after disclosures of substantial losses by a large Japanese company in trades of derivative financial instruments linked to copper , amid widely publicized speculation that the company controlled large unreported stocks of copper that had been used to manipulate market prices and prices of the derivative instruments .  
While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development , rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment , particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
In Gambia , for example , the 1994 Act on Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides Control and Management contains a provision that international notification schemes relating to chemicals and pesticides , including the prior informed consent procedures , are to be implemented . 94 Some other examples of national legal implementation of the principle of prior consultation are directly linked to regulations regarding environmental impact assessment procedures . 
It becomes more sensitive and complicated when it relates to the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif Jerusalem which has a unique political status and represents the spiritual patrimony of three religions and is closely linked to deep religious feelings in the Islamic world .  
In addition , it exceeded the mandate of a human rights working group by recommending detailed social , political and economic programmes at the national and international levels , and guidelines for international cooperation , some of which were not directly linked to the impact of structural adjustment programmes .  
Recognizes that the causes of mass exoduses are often of a structural nature and are directly linked to the prevailing unjust and inequitable international political and economic order , and notes in this regard that the study of purely national aspects alone will not reveal the real roots of the problem ;  
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
These measures are intrinsically linked to the just and lasting resolution of conflicts , the peaceful settlement of disputes , concrete and effective measures of disarmament through the accession of all the States of the region to the multinational agreements on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction ( the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Chemical Weapons Convention , the Biological Weapons Convention , etc . ) , and to the placement of all nuclear installations under international control .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
With regard to migration , that extremely complex phenomenon was linked to many demographic , social , ecological , psychological , historical and technological factors .  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , employment generation , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
My delegation is delighted to see the Chair of the CD occupied by a representative of Romania , a country with which Poland is linked by traditional bonds of friendship , which _ as confirmed during the recent visit of the President of Romania , Emil Constantinescu , to Warsaw _ is firmly based on shared values and aspirations .  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
However , this criterion must be linked with the preceding one , since such control must be sufficient to enable the armed group or dissident forces to conduct sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the Protocol .  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments , and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , generation of employment , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
The global plan of action , which sought to create the many new jobs required , especially in urban areas , specifically linked urban economic development to job creation and addressed the positive relationship between shelter and employment .  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Peace needs to be considered , not as the absence of differences and conflicts , but as a positive , dynamic , participatory process linked intrinsically to democracy , justice and development for all by which differences are respected , dialogue is encouraged and conflicts are constantly transformed by non-violent means into new avenues of understanding and cooperation .  
Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
Experience shows that the best results in entrepreneurial development are attained with programmes to promote and train entrepreneurs that are linked to support services with direct help to the potential entrepreneur in accessing finance , technical , managerial and marketing advice , and suitable physical facilities .  
We believe that this should be linked to a new system of international financial markets which would be more transparent and efficient and thus responsive and adaptable to the changing financial conditions in the world markets .  
Womens social position , marital status , class , or membership in particularly vulnerable groups , such as refugee or migrant women , rural or urban poor women , are often linked to de facto , and sometimes also to de jure , discrimination .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
Many indigenous representatives expressed the view that the forum should be established as a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council , while other indigenous representatives considered that it should be linked to the Economic and Social Council , in one way or another , although they were not in a position to identify the exact placement in the system at the current time .  
The European Union has supranational competition rules ( relating to RBPs , to public undertakings and undertakings granted special or exclusive rights , and to subsidies ) , which are linked by the Treaty of Rome to the fundamental objective of establishing a common market .  
Furthermore , labour-intensive public works can be effective for creating employment and productive infrastructure not only in situations linked to war , natural disasters or economic emergencies but also in a variety of regular investment programmes which can provide sustainable employment to those working in agriculture or in the informal economy .  
The Commission recognized that setting time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment would give a strong signal of the increased priority to be accorded to the objective of full employment . 7 In the past many countries have set targets for the intermediate goals of reduction of inflation or for the rate of economic growth but few set targets for the centrally important goal of employment growth and linked them with strategies for their achievement . 
Reaffirms that juvenile justice remains a high priority in the work of the Centre for International Crime Prevention and the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , in particular as children and young people , both those in conflict with the law and those in difficult circumstances who may be potential future criminals , are easy prey for criminal organizations closely linked with activities of transnational organized crime ;  
This does not fit in with the traditional concept of the commercial money market or purchasing flexibility , and constitutes a senseless waste of Iraqi funds , for reasons linked to the mechanism used by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for processing memorandum of understanding contracts .  
Preliminary reviews of the 1998 resident coordinator annual reports and UNDAF pilot exercises shows that thematic groups work more effectively when linked to or the result of combined efforts of major / key stakeholders to develop a framework for a coordinated and integrated country-level response to cross-cutting themes derived from major international conferences .  
Some are threatened by uncontrolled development of the economic activities they help to sustain ; others by introduced species of animals and plants ; still others by changing conditions such as rising sea temperature linked to global warming .  
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
ESCWAs mainstream activities in the population , social and women-related areas are being linked with the programmed activities outlined in a three-year extrabudgetary flagship project on integrated follow-up to global conferences , which was formulated by ESCWA and supported by UNDP to forge a regional link for Arab States between the global vision and national endeavours to pursue the recommendations of global conferences . 
As an ongoing matter of global concern that deals with major cross-cutting aspects of development , disaster prevention needs to be linked to all the relevant conclusions of the key United Nations conferences of the 1990s in order to implement strategies for reducing disaster losses in a coordinated , sustained approach for a safer twenty-first century .  
The aforementioned categories have been linked to the basic objectives of the national strategy for promoting compatibility between economic development and population growth and for improving the other categories , in order to create a better standard of living and to reduce poverty .  
Given the limited nature of UNHCRs involvement in Colombia , it is recognized that UNHCRs support will only be effective if linked to broader efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and to strengthen respect for human rights , within the context of a common approach with other United Nations partners .  
The spirit of the instruments would seem to be clear : the right to education principally concerns personal development , but in cases where this personal development is itself linked to the quality of the relational fabric that the person is able to weave with his or her peers , this fundamental right necessarily takes on a universal dimension , since social or national communities can no longer exist and develop in isolation .  
In 1982 , the Basic People 's Congresses ( the legislative mechanism ) approved the new educational structure with a view to redesigning the educational system by introducing technical and artistic education linked with vocational training at the basic and intermediate stages , the aim being to meet the needs of the national economy for a workforce with technical and vocational qualifications .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
That combination could only be created and maintained for so long because of the perverse mechanism that linked it to external markets ( in the northern states of the USA , by contrast , slavery never took a hold because the ecological conditions for export crops based on plantations were absent ) .  
Despite positive developments linked to the creation of the PA and removal of restrictions from the occupation period , economic activities were adversely affected and the interim period has been characterized by prolonged decline in the standard of living , with high and fluctuating unemployment .  
Rather than relying on artificial and arbitrary time-frames unrelated to need or performance , the expression of special and differential treatment should be linked to specific economic and social criteria .  
Thus , Africas struggle to achieve rapid economic transformation will be lost or won depending on how effectively industrial development is linked with agricultural development through enhanced manufacturing value added , productivity and competitiveness , with an accent on employment and income generation .  
These problems , which are linked to the inefficient functioning of the criminal justice system , are compounded by the lack of human resources , the dilapidated state of the courts , and the lack of means of communication , electricity , vehicles and office supplies , and in some cases of codes of judicial procedure .  
The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
A major development in relation to the HIPC initiative had been the Cologne debt initiative ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 44 ) , which linked debt relief to poverty reduction , and aimed at deepening and quickening debt reduction through a reduction in debt sustainability thresholds ; a deeper degree of cancellation ; interim relief ; floating completion points ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 46 ) ; and , as a result , an increase in the number of countries expected to be eligible for debt relief .  
Ms . Faetanini ( San Marino ) said that the General Assembly , at its twentieth special session , had stressed that drug supply and demand were closely linked and had placed the drug problem in its true perspective by emphasizing its social , economic and political implications .  
For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
Given this connectivity and owing to limited resources of national and other statistical offices for maintaining , updating and revising their standard classifications , agreement must be reached on the timing of further revisions of such linked international standards as the ones mentioned above so that all may change together in a more harmonious and minimally disruptive fashion .  
Modelling is most advanced in the field of global warming and climate change , and those models are gradually being developed and linked to other models to take account of demographic trends , land use changes , economic development projections and freshwater supplies , as well as atmospheric and oceanic factors .  
He welcomed the plan to establish a permanent international criminal court , which should be independent , strong and impartial , and linked with the United Nations through a special agreement to guarantee its universality and authority.It should be created by means of a treaty . 
The analysis seems to support the conclusion that TCDC has been more successful in those countries where government has put in place explicit TCDC policy linked with national development planning process ; established a strong TCDC focal point with the necessary supporting structure ; and earmarked national budgetary allocations or devised means for innovative use of external assistance , including triangular cooperation .  
That was demonstrated by the current social unrest in Benin ( varying from a merciless pursuit of armed gangs of looters to a widespread strike of civil servants ) , which was rooted in the economic problems linked to the countrys underdevelopment .  
A large number of these illegal immigrants are linked to organized international crime and terrorism , narcomafia , illicit trade in arms , human smuggling , juvenile crime and prostitution and are responsible for the criminalization of Kosovo and Metohija .  
The regional offices will be linked up by satellite and extended to districts by terrestrial radio , telephone and microwave links that will provide reliable and transparent connectivity .  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Like the CCA , it is countrydriven , prepared with the broad participation of civil society , key donors and other relevant international finance institutions , and linked to agreed international development goals .  
The right to development was an inalienable human right linked to the notion of social justice , and needed to be implemented through effective national policies and in the context of a more favourable economic climate .  
In short , increased responsibility in the arena of selfgovernance is linked to mature political and civic behaviour , which is not demonstrated by these violent acts .  
Despite the remarkable progress achieved in the 1990s ( in which 80 per cent of young children in developing countries had been immunized ; polio was on the verge of eradication ; more children than ever before were enrolled in schools ; and iodized salt was now being used on a wide scale ) , too many children were still dying from treatable diseases brought about by various causes linked to poverty and violence and by the AIDS pandemic .  
In the light of the fact that lasting peace , independence and freedom were inextricably linked to social and economic development , there was a need to consider the unique circumstances prevailing in the Non-Self-Governing Territories , such as vulnerability to natural disasters , fragility of ecosystems , geographical isolation and the need to protect the cultural traditions of local populations .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
Proclaiming its agreement to the talks , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , however , in the light of the opening paragraphs of the document , is surprised by the notion expressed in the unnumbered third paragraph , namely that the lack of positive results in bringing about an Afghan settlement is linked to the determination of the warring Afghan sides to settle the conflict solely by military means .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
HIV / AIDS is now a classic , modern health issue , closely connected with individual and collective human behaviour , strongly influenced by broad social and economic forces and linked particularly closely to social discrimination .  
As regards interpretative declarations , the Special Rapporteur indicated that , in general , they were linked to a prior text , but was of the view that in cases where the declarations went beyond the obligations contained in the treaty , the declarations would become independent acts whereby a State could assume international commitments ; these interpretative declarations would thus be included among the unilateral acts falling within the scope of the topic .  
Subscribes to the remarks of the expert to the effect that various obstacles linked to the realization of the right of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation seriously impede the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and that equality is an essential element for effective participation in the realization of the right to development and the right to a healthy environment ;  
Article 21 allows the competent judicial authority , at the request of a judicial authority in a country with which the United Arab Emirates is linked by an approved treaty , and provided that the act in question is established as a criminal offence in the United Arab Emirates , or on condition of reciprocity , to order the tracing , freezing or provisional attachment of assets or proceeds derived from or of instrumentalities used in a money-laundering offence .  
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
My delegation believes that security is a subject that is not linked to international peace and security alone , but encompasses a series of elements within a multisectoral framework that , in addition to security , includes the commitment to promote democracy and full respect for human rights , to battle crime and illicit drugs , and to foster overall social and economic development in a harmonious way .

It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
This growth in international information-sharing is linked to a large extent to increasing global awareness of the need for continuous monitoring of the environment , natural resources and changes stemming from human activity , as well as emergency management , together with the free use of previously restricted technologies .  
The success of cooperatives is inextricably linked with the cooperative values of mutuality and self-help , and with the fundamental cooperative principles which limit membership to genuine users ; govern through democratic control ; raise and distribute capital based on patronage ; educate and train members ; and encourage cooperation with other cooperatives , whether economic or to advance common goals .
