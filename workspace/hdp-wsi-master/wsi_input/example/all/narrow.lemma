Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
China 's household electrical appliance industry digested and absorbed foreign technology brought in through a variety of ways - - such as engaging in cooperative production with foreign name-brand enterprises and importing key installations as well as packages of technology and production lines - - and made innovations to greatly narrow the gap between Chinese and advanced international levels , thereby quickening the pace of development .

Such a mentality can easily create a nationalist sentiment , which the right-wing forces take advantage of to " guide according to circumstances . "  Given the social background that the Japanese economy has been stagnant for a long time and that the masses are in low spirits , they have incited a narrow nationalist sentiment under the banner of opposing " national self-maltreatment " and restoring national self-respect in a vain attempt to drag Japan into the morass of militarization again .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .

What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .

But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
The narrow streets are crowded with smoke-belching old cars discarded from the US . , the dilapidated wooden houses are gnawed by termites , and hurricanes are a source of constant trepidation ( after Belize City was devastated by one in 1961 , the government decided to build a new capital , Belmopan , in the center of the country ) .

The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses .

No matter whether you are talking about the Tatun Mountains or the tail end of the Huoshan and Hsuehshan Mountains toward Keelung , anyone looking from a ship at sea would not have seen some narrow , specific little point . Perhaps we will never be able to figure out which place it was that inspired " Formosa , " but the most reasonable explanation still seems to be that ships were passing Taiwan 's northern edge .

Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .

"  
Chambers could see how the formal garden was a travesty of nature . Yet the style of Brown , by which it was being replaced , blindly followed nature and lacked any sense of taste .

His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow .

All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .  
I met my husband during high school , when we were both involved in organizing extracurricular activities .

As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .

Thus " course integration " was an obvious orientation for change .  
When Wang Yeh circulated through the narrow lanes and alleyways of the town , doors were sealed and lights were extinguished in all houses along the route . The only illumination came from the lanterns of the inspection party . The songcaoren ritual for expelling evil , conducted just before the end of the inspection tour , was even more fearsome . Many legends surround bad things that happened to people who did n't get out of the way in time and were subject to the same terrifying forces that were called up to deal with demons .

In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
In response to these claims , on July 10 the e-paper of President Chen Shui-bian stated that Taiwan has always had a low-tuition policy , with the best schools often being the least expensive .

The succession of reciprocal vetoes , the sharpness of the exchanges , the modest scope of many of its resolutions and , above all , its silences in the face of serious crises which affected international peace and security reflected the narrow margin for action available to the Council and the United Nations when set against an overwhelming strategic struggle which shattered the hope for any multilateral solution . 
As we approach the next millennium and as the pre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the definition of national sovereignty , we must seriously question why a powerful minority is still allowed to bankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow economic and political needs .  
If power politics are allowed to be deployed in the pursuit of exclusive and narrow interests in a climate of confrontation , if the world 's resources are shared on the basis of military power rather than of international treaties and conventions , if priority is not given to international law and international cooperation , and if we attempt to evade the responsibilities that we have all undertaken under the Charter , however appealing and convenient that might appear in the short term , we will sow the seeds of chaos , anarchy and rapid disintegration .

The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
Chambers could see how the formal garden was a travesty of nature . Yet the style of Brown , by which it was being replaced , blindly followed nature and lacked any sense of taste . It was , in fact , hard to distinguish from the wilderness . Consisting of a few trees planted on a large grassy slope with a winding narrow path , people were spending a lot of money to produce not much more than an extravagant meadow .  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow .

His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow .

I met my husband during high school , when we were both involved in organizing extracurricular activities . After our wedding , we headed off together to the United States for graduate school at Cornell University , but I subsequently learned that I 'm not the right type to work for a PhD .

As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
In the advisory report issued in 1998 by the Executive Yuan 's Education Reform Committee , there is no sign of the words " integrated curriculum .

When Wang Yeh circulated through the narrow lanes and alleyways of the town , doors were sealed and lights were extinguished in all houses along the route . The only illumination came from the lanterns of the inspection party . The songcaoren ritual for expelling evil , conducted just before the end of the inspection tour , was even more fearsome .

In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .
