To practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing the revenues of collected administrative service fees , fines , and forfeitures is an important job to improve fiscal management and rectify fiscal and economic order .

Cao Gangchuan noted : Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , China 's scientific and technological undertaking for national defense has realized a historic leap of growing out of nothing and expanding from weak to strong and from small to large ;  
It is necessary to enable the broad masses of cadres and people to fully understand the superiority of the party 's correct leadership and the socialist system , which can concentrate efforts on doing big things , and to fully understand that the correct line , principles and policies for reform , opening up and modernization formulated by our party under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping are the fundamental guarantee to bringing about rapid economic and social development in our country .  
We urge the United States to observe the basic principles governing international relations , correct its erroneous doings , and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by using the so-called human rights issue .  
At the same time , in order to enhance the consciousness , foreseeability , and effectiveness of practical activities , we should base all major policy decisions on scientific research and adequate proofs ; and base all scientific forecasts and management on a correct understanding of the objective law of the society .  
We should keep to a correct orientation in our work , give wide publicity to the main theme of our time , carry forward and develop healthy trends in society , and occupy the front of mass culture with healthy and beneficial activities .  Exhibition halls , museums , science museums , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots are all required to propagate a spiritual civilization , oppose feudal and superstitious ideas , and resist vulgar interests .  
Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province has opened special columns , published serial reports , and initiated a large-scale discussion in the press , with a view to guiding the vast numbers of cadres and masses to gain a correct understanding of the new changes that have taken place in China 's economic development conditions today , further emancipate their mind and renew their concepts , and to think and act in line with the criterion of " three beneficial 's . "  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
We are convinced that the Taiwan compatriots will make their correct choice on this major issue of right and wrong concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country , the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation , and the future and destiny of the Taiwan compatriots .  
The most fundamental cause that Hainan was able to develop rapidly in the past 12 years is that it has all along been guided by the party 's basic theory , persisted in taking economic construction as the center , adhered to reform and opening up , and abided by the four cardinal principles .  The practice in Hainan has once again confirmed that the party 's basic theory and basic line are scientific and correct .  
A correct evaluation of the nature of growth in the economic returns of Liaoning ï¿½s state-owned industries will have a direct bearing on the choice of policy decisions for the next step of the reform of SOEs in Liaoning and even the whole nation .  The policy-making level in Liaoning Province has a sober understanding of this issue .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
Practice has proven that the central authorities ' series of policy decisions and arrangements are completely correct , practical , and effective , and have laid the foundation and pointed out the orientation for us to explore and embark on an anticorruption path suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating efforts to strengthen the ideological properties of young officers and men as the most important part of the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun ; and are guiding young officers and men to display a " spirit of the nail " [ grasping every available minute and second ] , painstakingly study Deng Xiaoping Theory and materialist dialectics , constantly lay a solid ideological theory foundation , and acquire correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
Article 47 Those who violate the provisions in Article 33 , Item ( 4 ) of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by using pores , fissures , and karst caves in the aquifer and abandoned mine pits for storing petroleum , radioactive matter , toxic chemicals , or pesticide shall be ordered by the environmental protection department of a people 's government at or above the county level to correct the mistake and shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
The establishment and development of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership is a historically correct choice and a sacred mission entrusted to us by the times .  It is in the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples and helps promote the course of multipolarization in the world and establish a just and rational new international order .  
Experience has proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , work patterns , and leadership systems for the anti-corruption campaign defined by the Central Committee are entirely correct , effective , and in keeping with China 's basic circumstances during the current phase .  They are the fundamental guarantee that we will continually achieve new results in the fight against corruption .  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
On 18 May , at a report meeting on " three stresses " and " review and reexamination " among leading bodies at the municipal level , Jia Qinglin , member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , required that party organizations at all levels of the municipality implement the " three represents " requirement set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin in their firm and correct implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies and in the strict enforcement of party discipline .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
as social and economic elements , organizational forms , main interested parties , and employment forms are being further diversified , how we should educate officers and men to foster a correct outlook on life and values and to carry forward the spirit of selfless devotion ;  
Without its progressive ideology and culture , without a unified national spirit , without correct values , it will be hard for a nation to hold an independent , self-determining , and self-strengthening status , and then such a nation will be susceptible to foreign influences and pressure .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
In practicing the " three represents , " leading cadres must have a correct attitude toward work and bring about a major change in leadership methods and the style of work ; they must be truthful and realistic and do solid work in a down-to-earth manner ; and they must earnestly and vigorously carry out policies and measures and achieve actual results through unremitting efforts .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
Through education on " the importance of studying , being political minded and being honest and upright " and education on party style and discipline , we should help the broad masses of party members and cadres foster a correct world outlook and concept of life and value and firmly resist material gains and commercialization in their political life .  We should help them clarify their thinking and distinguish between right and wrong and constantly strengthen their ability to repel corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
Strengthen examination and inspection over coordinated educational activities following introduction of information technology .  Make timely organization of such activities as selection of proper topics , collective classes , key rehearsals , and on-the-spot visits .  It is necessary to ensure the concentration of topics and the correct subject contents .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .  For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
Practice has proved that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership mechanism , and the work setup and arrangements drawn up by the party Central Committee for the responsibility system over the building a sound party style and a clean administration are totally correct ; and so long as we can unswervingly carry them out in practice , the responsibility system for the building of a sound party style and a clean administration can surely play a greater role in the practice of running the party strictly .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
We have also paid attention to guiding people in adopting a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values , and vigorously promoted patriotism , collectivism , socialism , and the spirit of building an enterprise through arduous effort , as well as all ethics that are conducive to state unity , national solidarity , economic development , and social progress .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
Commanders at all levels should effectively correct the erroneous trend of appreciating advanced weapons while neglecting backward ones , appreciating battle equipment while neglecting that used for logistic purposes , and appreciating hardware while neglecting software aspects of equipment .  They should , in light of the overall situation , make project plans from a broad and strategic perspective of balanced development and overall advancement .  
B : The new challenges and new opportunities require us to have the correct , proper new ideas that go with the flow but also are realistic and practical for us .  Our economic construction should never again embark on a developmental path of extensive expansion .  We should no longer pursue rapid growth only in terms of the total economic volume .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee revolving around Jiang Zemin and with the strong support of the people of the whole country and the full cooperation of all sectors , Chinese diplomacy last year oriented itself to the future , broke new ground and forged ahead .  Its successes were outstanding .  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Centered on establishing the correct world view , view of life and values , we must combine inheriting the fine traditions with promoting the spirit of the age , integrate respect for the legitimate rights of the individual with shouldering social responsibilities , coordinate attention to efficiency with upholding social fairness , combine progressive demands with broad demands , and make efforts to form healthy , harmonious , and upwardly progressive ideological and ethical standards commensurate with economic and social development .  
Sinking into the mire deeper and deeper , they were finally devoid of all senses and lost self-control .  It is true that Li Hongzhi and his like are cunning and their fallacies are quite deceitful , but the tragic end of some " Falungong " infatuates could not be separated from their ignorance and a lack of a correct world outlook and a correct outlook on life .  
We should excel at understanding historical development trends and walk on the cutting edge of the times .  We should also be skillful in basing everything in reality , formulating the correct policies and strategies for development and be consistently innovative in theory , systems , science and technology in order to develop every project in modernization construction in a health , fast and sustainable way in the new century .  
The spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is incompatible with those corrupt ideas by nature .  Vigorously promoting this spirit can effectively sweep away such corruption and enable us to maintain a strong will to fight , to maintain lofty ideas , firm stances and the correct direction so as to formulate spiritual strengths , values and public opinions beneficial to the reform and construction .  
Thereby , we must take a correct attitude toward the thought of " rule by virtue " as advocated by ancient Confucius school by absorbing its reasonable and accurate aspects and rejecting its wrong parts unsuitable to the demands of modern society .  
In accordance with unified arrangements laid down by the Central Military Commission , the general departments selected and built in a centralized way a batch of key academic disciplines , key laboratories , or key academies or schools on the basis of a scientific forecast and sufficient demonstration .  Over the past five years , various major units , academies , or schools charged with the task of building key projects have persistently followed a correct direction ;  
Given the circumstances of the socialist market economy , the Party Central Committee has also adapted to the transition in the Party 's approach toward leadership and managing state affairs , has realistically improved Party leadership , displayed Party leadership of the united front on democratic consultation , made the Party 's correct stand become the common ground of the vast majority of members of the united front , and united and led them to work for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
During the 9th Five-Year Plan , Zhang Wannian said , the whole army scored remarkable successes in family planning and environmental protection work under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission and thanks to the concerted efforts of the party committees at all levels and the broad ranks of officers and men .  The prominent features include leaders ' attention to the work , clear train of thought , solid work , and marked achievements .  
As early as when the clarion call for military training through science and technology was sounded at the " Liaoyang centralized training program , " Chairman Jiang noted that military training through science and technology is an important measure for adapting the military to the trend of worldwide military development , this training was advancing in the correct direction and we should devote consistent and unswerving efforts to this training .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
Zheng Ming stressed in the aforementioned exclusive interview with the magazine : China must strengthen the maritime awareness of the entire nation .  At the same time , it must also establish a correct and effective ocean strategy , and bring about an all-round and high-speed development to its maritime economy .  Only in this way will China be able to deal with increasingly grim challenges of all kinds in the future .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
Over the past 20-odd years , ever since it was established , CITIC has witnessed relatively smooth development as it has benefited from a correct understanding or judgment of the global economic situation , and this is the key reason , and is inseparable from the work of the CITIC Consultation Committee .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
Xu Xinghu 's and Wang Wei 's families agreed that our government has upheld state sovereignty and national dignity in its handling of the plane collision incident , expressed firm support for our government 's correct decision , and demanded that the United States accept all responsibility for the incident and come clean with the Chinese people .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : Strengthening the work of public security and rectifying and standardizing the market economic order are a major policy decision made by the party Central Committee and State Council to correct the present public-security problems and market disorder .  These two tasks are important measures to perfect our socialist market economic system , promote the healthy development of the national economy , and ensure social stability .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
This thinking is a succinct summary of the correct world outlook , outlook on life , and concept on value for the communist party members , which has reflected the demands on cadres by the new situation and tasks , and embodied the unity in the criteria for political integrity and professional competence .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
We should correct the guiding principle of our tasks , make great efforts to eradicate unhealthy workings styles like bureaucracy , characterized by staying high above reality and soldiers , and formalism , characterized by pursuing unrealistic personal fame and working in a perfunctory manner , so as to improve the comprehensive quality of officers .  
Supporting the Party 's principles , guiding public opinion in the correct direction , the overall situation of serving Tibet : these are three mutual relationships coexisting in a single entity ; this is a political demand the Party makes of its organs ' newspapers , the sublime mission of those who run the newspapers .

It is necessary to enable the broad masses of cadres and people to fully understand the superiority of the party 's correct leadership and the socialist system , which can concentrate efforts on doing big things , and to fully understand that the correct line , principles and policies for reform , opening up and modernization formulated by our party under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping are the fundamental guarantee to bringing about rapid economic and social development in our country .  
We urge the United States to observe the basic principles governing international relations , correct its erroneous doings , and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by using the so-called human rights issue .  
At the same time , in order to enhance the consciousness , foreseeability , and effectiveness of practical activities , we should base all major policy decisions on scientific research and adequate proofs ; and base all scientific forecasts and management on a correct understanding of the objective law of the society .  
We should keep to a correct orientation in our work , give wide publicity to the main theme of our time , carry forward and develop healthy trends in society , and occupy the front of mass culture with healthy and beneficial activities .  Exhibition halls , museums , science museums , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots are all required to propagate a spiritual civilization , oppose feudal and superstitious ideas , and resist vulgar interests .  
Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province has opened special columns , published serial reports , and initiated a large-scale discussion in the press , with a view to guiding the vast numbers of cadres and masses to gain a correct understanding of the new changes that have taken place in China 's economic development conditions today , further emancipate their mind and renew their concepts , and to think and act in line with the criterion of " three beneficial 's . "  
China 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and to the firm leadership of the third-generation leading core .  Zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions .  Its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .  
We are convinced that the Taiwan compatriots will make their correct choice on this major issue of right and wrong concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country , the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation , and the future and destiny of the Taiwan compatriots .  
The most fundamental cause that Hainan was able to develop rapidly in the past 12 years is that it has all along been guided by the party 's basic theory , persisted in taking economic construction as the center , adhered to reform and opening up , and abided by the four cardinal principles .  The practice in Hainan has once again confirmed that the party 's basic theory and basic line are scientific and correct .  
A correct evaluation of the nature of growth in the economic returns of Liaoning ï¿½s state-owned industries will have a direct bearing on the choice of policy decisions for the next step of the reform of SOEs in Liaoning and even the whole nation .  The policy-making level in Liaoning Province has a sober understanding of this issue .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
Practice has proven that the central authorities ' series of policy decisions and arrangements are completely correct , practical , and effective , and have laid the foundation and pointed out the orientation for us to explore and embark on an anticorruption path suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating efforts to strengthen the ideological properties of young officers and men as the most important part of the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun ; and are guiding young officers and men to display a " spirit of the nail " [ grasping every available minute and second ] , painstakingly study Deng Xiaoping Theory and materialist dialectics , constantly lay a solid ideological theory foundation , and acquire correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
Article 47 Those who violate the provisions in Article 33 , Item ( 4 ) of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by using pores , fissures , and karst caves in the aquifer and abandoned mine pits for storing petroleum , radioactive matter , toxic chemicals , or pesticide shall be ordered by the environmental protection department of a people 's government at or above the county level to correct the mistake and shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
The establishment and development of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership is a historically correct choice and a sacred mission entrusted to us by the times .  It is in the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples and helps promote the course of multipolarization in the world and establish a just and rational new international order .  
Experience has proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , work patterns , and leadership systems for the anti-corruption campaign defined by the Central Committee are entirely correct , effective , and in keeping with China 's basic circumstances during the current phase .  They are the fundamental guarantee that we will continually achieve new results in the fight against corruption .  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .  
On 18 May , at a report meeting on " three stresses " and " review and reexamination " among leading bodies at the municipal level , Jia Qinglin , member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , required that party organizations at all levels of the municipality implement the " three represents " requirement set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin in their firm and correct implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies and in the strict enforcement of party discipline .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
as social and economic elements , organizational forms , main interested parties , and employment forms are being further diversified , how we should educate officers and men to foster a correct outlook on life and values and to carry forward the spirit of selfless devotion ;  
Without its progressive ideology and culture , without a unified national spirit , without correct values , it will be hard for a nation to hold an independent , self-determining , and self-strengthening status , and then such a nation will be susceptible to foreign influences and pressure .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
In practicing the " three represents , " leading cadres must have a correct attitude toward work and bring about a major change in leadership methods and the style of work ; they must be truthful and realistic and do solid work in a down-to-earth manner ; and they must earnestly and vigorously carry out policies and measures and achieve actual results through unremitting efforts .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
Through education on " the importance of studying , being political minded and being honest and upright " and education on party style and discipline , we should help the broad masses of party members and cadres foster a correct world outlook and concept of life and value and firmly resist material gains and commercialization in their political life .  We should help them clarify their thinking and distinguish between right and wrong and constantly strengthen their ability to repel corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
Strengthen examination and inspection over coordinated educational activities following introduction of information technology .  Make timely organization of such activities as selection of proper topics , collective classes , key rehearsals , and on-the-spot visits .  It is necessary to ensure the concentration of topics and the correct subject contents .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .  For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
It has upheld singing out the principal melody , successfully fought the battle of initiative , grasped the important issues , taken education and trust in ideals as the core , strongly propagated patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , deeply implemented the Party 's fundamental theory , its basic line , its basic education on guiding principles , established a correct world view , outlook on life , and value judgments .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
and to check corruption , one should stand up for healthy trends " .  Only when we arm the minds of the vast numbers of party-member cadres with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and only when we educate and guide them to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values , can they develop a strong spiritual pillar , a correct understanding of right and wrong , and an effective political immunity .  
Practice has proved that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership mechanism , and the work setup and arrangements drawn up by the party Central Committee for the responsibility system over the building a sound party style and a clean administration are totally correct ; and so long as we can unswervingly carry them out in practice , the responsibility system for the building of a sound party style and a clean administration can surely play a greater role in the practice of running the party strictly .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
We have also paid attention to guiding people in adopting a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values , and vigorously promoted patriotism , collectivism , socialism , and the spirit of building an enterprise through arduous effort , as well as all ethics that are conducive to state unity , national solidarity , economic development , and social progress .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
Commanders at all levels should effectively correct the erroneous trend of appreciating advanced weapons while neglecting backward ones , appreciating battle equipment while neglecting that used for logistic purposes , and appreciating hardware while neglecting software aspects of equipment .  They should , in light of the overall situation , make project plans from a broad and strategic perspective of balanced development and overall advancement .  
B : The new challenges and new opportunities require us to have the correct , proper new ideas that go with the flow but also are realistic and practical for us .  Our economic construction should never again embark on a developmental path of extensive expansion .  We should no longer pursue rapid growth only in terms of the total economic volume .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee revolving around Jiang Zemin and with the strong support of the people of the whole country and the full cooperation of all sectors , Chinese diplomacy last year oriented itself to the future , broke new ground and forged ahead .  Its successes were outstanding .  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Centered on establishing the correct world view , view of life and values , we must combine inheriting the fine traditions with promoting the spirit of the age , integrate respect for the legitimate rights of the individual with shouldering social responsibilities , coordinate attention to efficiency with upholding social fairness , combine progressive demands with broad demands , and make efforts to form healthy , harmonious , and upwardly progressive ideological and ethical standards commensurate with economic and social development .  
Sinking into the mire deeper and deeper , they were finally devoid of all senses and lost self-control .  It is true that Li Hongzhi and his like are cunning and their fallacies are quite deceitful , but the tragic end of some " Falungong " infatuates could not be separated from their ignorance and a lack of a correct world outlook and a correct outlook on life .  
We should excel at understanding historical development trends and walk on the cutting edge of the times .  We should also be skillful in basing everything in reality , formulating the correct policies and strategies for development and be consistently innovative in theory , systems , science and technology in order to develop every project in modernization construction in a health , fast and sustainable way in the new century .  
The spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is incompatible with those corrupt ideas by nature .  Vigorously promoting this spirit can effectively sweep away such corruption and enable us to maintain a strong will to fight , to maintain lofty ideas , firm stances and the correct direction so as to formulate spiritual strengths , values and public opinions beneficial to the reform and construction .  
Thereby , we must take a correct attitude toward the thought of " rule by virtue " as advocated by ancient Confucius school by absorbing its reasonable and accurate aspects and rejecting its wrong parts unsuitable to the demands of modern society .  
In accordance with unified arrangements laid down by the Central Military Commission , the general departments selected and built in a centralized way a batch of key academic disciplines , key laboratories , or key academies or schools on the basis of a scientific forecast and sufficient demonstration .  Over the past five years , various major units , academies , or schools charged with the task of building key projects have persistently followed a correct direction ;  
Given the circumstances of the socialist market economy , the Party Central Committee has also adapted to the transition in the Party 's approach toward leadership and managing state affairs , has realistically improved Party leadership , displayed Party leadership of the united front on democratic consultation , made the Party 's correct stand become the common ground of the vast majority of members of the united front , and united and led them to work for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
During the 9th Five-Year Plan , Zhang Wannian said , the whole army scored remarkable successes in family planning and environmental protection work under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission and thanks to the concerted efforts of the party committees at all levels and the broad ranks of officers and men .  The prominent features include leaders ' attention to the work , clear train of thought , solid work , and marked achievements .  
As early as when the clarion call for military training through science and technology was sounded at the " Liaoyang centralized training program , " Chairman Jiang noted that military training through science and technology is an important measure for adapting the military to the trend of worldwide military development , this training was advancing in the correct direction and we should devote consistent and unswerving efforts to this training .  
Under such circumstances , one would lose his bearing and would stray from the right path if he slightly relaxes his vigilance .  In real life , some party-member cadres , including some veteran comrades who have joined the party for many years , have been taken in by crooked ideas and fallacies , and have become the captive of decadent cultures and a fast life .  The fundamental cause of their failure is their departure from the correct ideal and conviction .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
Zheng Ming stressed in the aforementioned exclusive interview with the magazine : China must strengthen the maritime awareness of the entire nation .  At the same time , it must also establish a correct and effective ocean strategy , and bring about an all-round and high-speed development to its maritime economy .  Only in this way will China be able to deal with increasingly grim challenges of all kinds in the future .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
Over the past 20-odd years , ever since it was established , CITIC has witnessed relatively smooth development as it has benefited from a correct understanding or judgment of the global economic situation , and this is the key reason , and is inseparable from the work of the CITIC Consultation Committee .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
Xu Xinghu 's and Wang Wei 's families agreed that our government has upheld state sovereignty and national dignity in its handling of the plane collision incident , expressed firm support for our government 's correct decision , and demanded that the United States accept all responsibility for the incident and come clean with the Chinese people .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : Strengthening the work of public security and rectifying and standardizing the market economic order are a major policy decision made by the party Central Committee and State Council to correct the present public-security problems and market disorder .  These two tasks are important measures to perfect our socialist market economic system , promote the healthy development of the national economy , and ensure social stability .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
This thinking is a succinct summary of the correct world outlook , outlook on life , and concept on value for the communist party members , which has reflected the demands on cadres by the new situation and tasks , and embodied the unity in the criteria for political integrity and professional competence .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
We should correct the guiding principle of our tasks , make great efforts to eradicate unhealthy workings styles like bureaucracy , characterized by staying high above reality and soldiers , and formalism , characterized by pursuing unrealistic personal fame and working in a perfunctory manner , so as to improve the comprehensive quality of officers .  
Supporting the Party 's principles , guiding public opinion in the correct direction , the overall situation of serving Tibet : these are three mutual relationships coexisting in a single entity ; this is a political demand the Party makes of its organs ' newspapers , the sublime mission of those who run the newspapers .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .
