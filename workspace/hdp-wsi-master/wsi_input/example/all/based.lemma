It can create " future " wars based on the general law of development governing hi-tech wars and by taking into full consideration China 's security posture , international influence , political and geographical environment , national characteristics , and other distinct features .  
In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
In order to accelerate the steps towards making a leap in training , we should extract from past " exhibitions " and " briefings " on real technology based on existing computer networks to train the troops , and rely on all training bases ' extensive opening up of simulated training to enable the troops to become familiar with and master information technology and equipment as soon as possible .  At the " pre-reality line " simulating real combat , we should promote informational training .  
From this , our army 's development , based on support , has proceeded only on a shrunken scale , weakening the military 's function in managing society ; the larger development trend has already gradually realized self-support capabilities integrated with socialized support .  
In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .  In this way , the study and implementation of the " three represents " has become a major part of the teaching by positive example in the " three stresses " education .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .  We must gradually establish an effective mechanism of management based on supervision , control , and cooperation among different departments .  We must continue to improve the import and export inspection mechanism based on cooperation of all departments concerned to ensure trouble free in the process of producing , marketing , transporting , using , and importing and exporting precursor chemicals .  
We should adjust the military 's logistical structure in a scientific manner based on the principle of being qualified , combination , and high efficiency , perfect the support system , strengthen mobile support forces , and enhance the strategic support function .  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .

The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .

This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .

The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .

Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .

The starting point of this assumption ( namely , guarding against the threat of missile attacks ) of the United States failed to convince Germany . A considerably large number of personages from the military and political circles believed that this is not reasonable .

Let us put it in another way .  Man 's various imaginations about the afterlife are actually based on this life ; therefore , if an afterlife theory totally negates the value and meaning of this life , totally runs counter to man 's essential common sense in this life , and totally violates man 's moral principles in this life , then it can easily fall into a ridiculous and weird circle , and can easily be used for conducting all kinds of activities that bring harm to man .  
Our military 's current budget-making method was based on the planned economy .

Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
The first contradiction is that some groups and individuals may exploit their resource advantages , previously acquired under the traditional system , to pursue gains under market conditions , thereby forming exclusive , speculative , and closed benefit-distribution groups whose resource-monopoly capability will undermine a balanced interest-differentiation process based on the normal development of the market economy .

All this has shown China 's diplomatic skills in proficiently handling complicated international issues .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .

The majority of the first settlers were engaged in farming . The rugged terrain , and damp climate encouraged the cultivation of tea and oranges .

We must , however , proceed with extreme caution in our mainland policy . For obvious reasons , our first concern must continue to be our national security . And our policy of no official contact with the Chinese Communist regime will remain unchanged . President Lee Teng-hui summed it up well when he declared that our mainland policy can not be based on a romantic longing , but is a serious task that must be carefully undertaken .

Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .

Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution .

The theory of the " malignant / benign polarity " might sound reasonable enough , and the various traditional Chinese occult sciences based on it , such as geomancy ( examining this polarity in spatial terms ) or Chinese medicine 's concern with regulating cold and heat , may be backed by crystal clear logical argument .  
American fast food came to Taiwan in 1984 in the shape of McDonald 's , whose first Taipei outlet achieved a record turnover for the worldwide chain in the first week of opening .

And if you make windfall profits on speculation , then that 's just smart planning .

Even though they gave their lives in the air , since they never graduated , the monthly compensation afforded to their families is based on that of a sergeant , not an official pilot - - a mere NT $ 10,000 or so a month , only enough to reopen the wounds of grief of their aging parents . Air force pilots share a passion for flying , and they know that in making their dream come true they may eventually have to pay the ultimate price .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
The student-teacher relationship was based on shared convictions and sometimes involved mutual benefit , and thus " a man 's influence [ was ] measured by the number of his followers , " and in Chinese history there have been innumerable instances of " factional strife " and " protecting one 's own faction and attacking others . "  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
In fact , with reference to existing prenatal diagnostic techniques for genetic disorders , the ROC Department of Health has issued administrative orders warning doctors that conducting fetal gender tests on pregnant women , or performing abortions based on the fetal gender , would make them guilty of malpractice under the Medical Practice Law and the Medical Treatment Law . But there are still gynecology clinics whose signboards blatantly carry such wording as " CVS testing , 100% accurate . "  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
But the nearby culture of Qi has gradually been all but forgotten by history . Lu civilization was based on agriculture . Agricultural civilization tends toward the soft , the delicate , the conservative . It stresses ethics , human sentiment , stability , the golden mean and morality .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
It was July and August , the height of summer . Our rough and ready vessel had no cabin to rest in , and only incomplete equipment . But everyone , based on their fondness for whales and dolphins , overcame the intense sun and the unsettling waves . We all survived seasickness and sunburn , and learned how to get a firm position on the rolling deck so we could take clear photos .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Its methodology is based upon today 's Voluntary High School Admissions Program , which adopts a five-level grade scoring system . ( This program , implemented in an experimental phase in 1990 , allows participating junior high students to advance to high school based on written application forms and school grades , rather than performance on the joint entrance exam . )  
However , as in the example of author Lin Ching-hsuen , people are often wrongly categorized based on these test results , and more and more doubts are being cast on this type of testing . This has been particularly true in recent years with Taiwan 's active promotion of special gifted and talented programs . Because such a large proportion of gifted students are chosen based on IQ tests , the question of the practicality and fairness of such measures has stirred up a great deal of controversy .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
Moreover , Islam 's greatest emotional power is in the Qur'an . " It clears the mind and teaches the true way , " he says . The faithful believe that the Qur'an is a record of what the Prophet Mohammed received from Allah . Mohammed was illiterate ; the Qur'an was compiled by his successors based on what Mohammed told them , and completed after his death , in the seventh century CE .  
Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
The fundamental principles behind the operation of a synchrotron are based in electromagnetic theory : when electrons moving at near the speed of light are subjected to a magnetic field , they can then be deflected to create strong radiation in a tangential direction-namely , synchrotron radiation .  
" Having aboriginal people , who have always been the subjects of anthropological study , operating the camera themselves is a revolution in the history of documentary film making , " exclaims Wang . It is of course a separate issue whether or not documentaries based on their own subjective points of view will be " better , " but from a human rights point of view , granting the subjects of research the right to speak for themselves is definitely to be encouraged .  
As for how serious the situation should become before closing schools , Chen Chien-jen , a professor at the Graduate Institute of Epidemiology at NTU 's School of Public Health , pointed out that judgment about the seriousness of an outbreak requires an objective decision based on an understanding of the communicability of a disease , the number and density of people who are infected , and the rate of secondary infection , as well as other epidemiological data , and should not be based on a subjective considerations .  
" Generally speaking , based on the production process , dZi beads ought to count as a kind of " etched agate " [ agate to which alkaline metal has been applied and heated to create a surface for etching designs ] , " Chang Hung-shih explains .  
In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait . According to the ROC Ministry of Defense , in recent years the PRC has continually seen Taiwan 's new generation of military capabilities as its primary hypothetical enemy and undertaken numerous military exercises based on this premise . In addition , the national defense report just issued by the PRC emphasized repeatedly that the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan could not be excluded .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
These expensive anti-aging therapies begin with a thorough physical evaluation . In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Lu Tien-yen , head of the Taipei Modern Painters Group and a participant in the Hong Kong show , explains that traditional art is based largely on feeling , and it is easy to appreciate its aesthetic . Modern art , on the other hand , is rational and logical , and the theoretical background to a work is vital .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
On the day after his inauguration , during a visit to Kinmen , Chen pointed out that under the precondition of ensuring national security , the new government would , based on the laws of the market and the principle of reciprocal and proportional benefit , reexamine the three links . The Executive Yuan is in fact already engaged in an urgent discussion of the three links . Human rights diplomacy In the future , the government plans to make economic relations the main axis of cross-strait policy .  
Li Hsi-chi got his initial inspiration from the inscribed wooden plaques that grace the door lintels of clan temples in Kinmen . He executed an entire series of paintings based on them before moving on to throw occasional poetry events modeled after the elegant parties indulged in by the upper classes in centuries past . Li also called on artists and writers from both Taiwan and the mainland to tour Kinmen and understand the beauty of the local culture . These activities spurred the local community to a heightened interest in cultural preservation .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
This independent film festival , which aimed to present the Amis ' own world view , brought together 14 films by four Amis directors and one Japanese director . The organizers attempted to cast off impressions of the aboriginal peoples based on a mishmash of cultural cliches , and also hoped that the festival and its accompanying seminars , concert and gourmet buffet would help city people understand the true " Pangcah . " " Pangcah " is the Amis word for " human being , " and also the term by which the Amis refer to themselves .  
And Tan Hong-hui , head of the Lee Giong-chiu Taiwanese Language Foundation , describes the debate over Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin as " an effort to decide which rotten apple is preferable . " Tan 's primary concern is that an inappropriate choice of a standard romanization system could have an adverse impact on future efforts to teach Taiwanese to school children . Hanyu Pinyin is based strictly on Mandarin , and ca n't be used to represent some of the sounds in Taiwanese .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
Hsiao Tsu won her case , but the judge ruled that there was no concrete basis for her NT $ 15 million claim , and also said that one can not demand future education funds in a lump sum , and consequently rejected this claim in favor of one based on a standard selected by the court .  
Understanding the structure of the universe is a long-standing dream of astronomers . In the past our understanding of cosmic structure was based on little more than theoretical speculation .

Red team scholars typically argue that the US and PRC share many long-term interests in common and that a cooperative relationship can be built and maintained . The Clinton administration 's policy of an " active strategic partnership " was based on suggestions made by so-called red team scholars .  
" A design based on the cooling techniques used in jet engines would definitely be much more effective than the typical electric fans now in use , and would be less costly to manufacture , " explains Lai . Currently a major computer manufacturer in Taiwan has acquired the design patent to this kind of technology , which will be applied to the production of as many as 200,000 notebook computers a year .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .

Its design is based on the idea of an eastward-facing traditional Taiwanese sanheyuan farmhouse ( which has a square courtyard that is open on one side and enclosed on three by the main hall and its two wings ) . The school has a simple layout , with its classrooms connected by corridors . Doorways are constructed out of decorative cinderblocks and banisters out of stainless steel molded into plant motifs and matched with wooden railings . Outer walls are decorated with round , square , rectangular and cloud-shaped openings .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
The magazine 's reporting was based on the underlying premise that " sex is scandalous , " and the Hsu sisters ' agent put on a vigorous " damage control " campaign and assured the public that the sisters never took Ecstasy or had sex . The two sides engaged in a furious round of accusations and denials , but one thing they did agree on was that sex is a dirty word . It was all oddly out of character for a couple of girls whose stock-in-trade was their image of being rebellious and outlandish .  
An October weekend in Suzhou 's Mudu Town , there 's not a cloud in the sky but the cold wind chills to the bone .

On the contrary , in 1994 Mexico , recognizing the importance of strengthening its relations with Cuba , a neighbouring country with which it has maintained a tradition of friendly relations based on strict respect for the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples , sought to strengthen its economic cooperation with that country through bilateral meetings between the two Governments and support for joint investments in Cuba by Mexican companies .  
Where it is itself directly concerned , the Russian Federation is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and the freedom of international trade and navigation as mentioned in resolution 49 / 9 , and continues to support normal trade and economic relations with Cuba based on common interest and mutual benefit .

Nations intervention should be confined to situations which posed an unquestionable threat to international peace and security and where Security Council decisions were based on the clearly expressed support of the majority of Member States , rather than on the political exigencies of a few States , no matter how powerful they might be .

Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .

It is my delegation 's hope that our deliberations today , as well as the current intensive rounds of diplomatic efforts , will help bring about such an outcome , for the vicious cycle of violence and bloodshed which has bedeviled the Middle East must be broken and a comprehensive and just peace based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) must be realized .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .

International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
In this manner , we are seeking to include Africa in all its aspects on the international agenda , stressing , on the one hand , the scale and economic potential of the African continent , which is deserving of a new approach and a new model for dialogue , and , on the other hand , encouraging African countries to embark on their own process of development based on the promotion of peace , democracy , stability and economic and social progress .  
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States . Disarmament , sustainable development , enhancement of the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are priority issues that affect the security and well-being of peoples throughout the world .  
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
To complete its programme of building a State based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all citizens of Benin would enjoy a certain minimum standard of living , the Government of Benin wishes to benefit further from the support and assistance of the entire international community .  
The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
Responsibility for social development is based on two pivotal factors : national responsibility and collective commitment , as reflected in the combined efforts of the international community .  
The characteristic distinction of the late twentieth century is that relations among nations are based on interrelated , mutual and diverse interests in various political , economic and social fields .  
The Sudan is of the view that the structure of the international community , which is based on ideological , political and cultural diversity and pluralism , prompts us all to accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony and diversity among nations become the vehicle for interaction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing national interests in the context of the international system .  
Given the new challenges of these final years of our millennium , the International Court of Justice today , half a century after its founding , has become the body to which States , both large and small , and international organizations are turning increasingly to seek justice or to request the Court 's authoritative opinion on disputes , differences or legal problems that arise or create differences between them , convinced that the only valid and lasting solution is one based on law .  
Chowdhury ( Bangladesh ) : At its fiftieth session the General Assembly reaffirmed the commitments made by the Heads of the State or Government at Copenhagen and decided to give highest priority to the national , regional and international policies and actions for the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition , based on full participation by all .  
Furthermore , my Government places particular emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups , such as the disabled , in the process of social development , in the firm conviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society can be realized only when all people , irrespective of their physical or mental disadvantages , are able to pursue a life of happiness and dignity based on stability and equality .  
It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .  
The Government has formulated specific and concrete plans aimed at modernizing the productive structures of the country , in order to legitimize a new economic plan through genuine proposals for social development , based on the concept of social solidarity and good governance .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
There are still many who need to be convinced that nuclear technology is the inevitable option for satisfying the energy needs of developing countries and that it is worthwhile supporting nuclear-technology based programmes and activities also in the fields of fresh water , food , health and the environment .  
Despite a large degree of convergence on many of the issues that will be addressed by this convention , we feel constrained to reiterate that , for countries like India , whose nuclear programme is based on a closed fuel cycle , it would not be possible to consider including spent fuel in a convention dealing with the safety of radioactive waste management .  
This obliges States , within the framework of the United Nations system , to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly engage in management activities in the Organization based on the new cultural , economic and geographical reality made up of broad functional regional areas .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
With its unique approach , the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was aimed at renewing the commitment of African countries and the international community to an agenda for the sustainable social and economic development of Africa in a spirit of global partnership based on shared responsibilities .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
I therefore wish to express Colombia 's support for the draft resolution before us , based on our commitment to the principle of respect for international law and to help promote freer , more vigorous and more transparent international trade allowing developing countries to strive for economic and social development .  
Russia , firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and international navigation , supports and intends to broaden normal economic and commercial ties with Cuba , based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage , and to put them into effect in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms .  
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
The successful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relations based on internationally accepted principles can not be replaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitious regional associations .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
This is particularly true since the United Nations Charter , in our view a view shared by many others still represents a major instrument governing international life , and since any international order , be it old or new , must be based on a solid foundation that respects rights , determines obligations and opens the door to an era of interaction among societies on the basis of acceptance and understanding , not imposition or oppression .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
Peace in the Middle East will not be comprehensive or lasting until a strict regime for regional security is established , based on arrangements that provide equal security for all parties with minimum levels of armament .  
We are confident that the same initiative , determination and courage that the parties demonstrated in forging a historical framework for the peace and stability of the region can likewise be invoked to pave a new avenue built upon cooperation and coexistence that will eventually lead to a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) .  
Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .  
Today , at a time when the reform of the system is the subject of such intense discussion , our national experience may perhaps be useful , as it is an example of cooperation that is at once respectful and dynamic , based fundamentally on internal efforts with appropriate external help .

Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
In this transitional stage , lasting only six months , the late Mr . Ghafoorzai intended and was steadfast in his determination to convene the grand national decision-making assembly and the formation of a broad-based inclusive government based on a democratic constitution .  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
In this connection , it will be recalled that , consistent with established practice , the revised appropriation for 1996-1997 reflects actual exchange rates experienced in the first year of the biennium ( 1996 ) and projected rates for the second year ( 1997 ) based on the rate realized in December 1996 .  
On the contrary , genuine peace must be based on respect for the rule of law , on the acceptance of the solidarity and interdependence of all States and on the common desire to move dynamically forward towards the solution of the critical problems of dire poverty , disease , unemployment , illiteracy and economic and social inequality among peoples and nations .  
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
By engendering social and racial harmony based on a political compact , we have been spared many of the traumas experienced by less fortunate countries and we were thus able to achieve our development goals in relative peace and tranquillity .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
We continue to draw vital sustenance from what is , after all , a West Indian partnership rooted in a shared love for , and practice of , democracy , a democracy that is not resting on its laurels , but that is engaged now in a process of revitalization based on the urgent search for collective economic security and social advance .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
However , we know that we can rely on international cooperation , founded not only on solidarity , but on mutual interest and partnership , to overcome the difficulties confronting us , to support our efforts at economic and social recovery , to build a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to construct a free , democratic , modern and prosperous nation .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
The issues he articulated the imperative of development cooperation based on common concerns ; shared values ; solidarity and responsibility to each other ; the need for more resolute action at the international level to address the problem of widening global inequalities and marginalization are issues that require broad debate . 
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
We have consistently extended our firm support to this legal regime , which has paved the path to securing our common goal of ensuring long-term , stable and sustainable living resources of the vast oceans and seas based on cooperation , mutual benefit and shared responsibility .  
The formula based on geographical representation shifts the emphasis of the entire reform process towards a replacement of the former ideologized bipolar world by a new bipolarity of North-South , which runs counter to a balanced perception of the objectives which have been laid out , which take into account the interests of all geographic regions .  
This reservation is based on the decision of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers to suspend Arab participation in the multilateral committees until tangible progress is achieved in the peace process , particularly on the bilateral tracks , and until the Israeli Government has fulfilled its commitment to implement the signed agreements and obligations already subscribed to in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and other resolutions .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
Our unique fair share approach , which is based on consideration of the three Es environmental protection , economic development and social equity is designed to ensure adequate and clean supplies of water for all .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .

Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
Her Government 's approach to advancing gender equality was based on the recognition that gender was a factor in the nation 's current social , economic , cultural and political systems and that the unequal status of women had its genesis in and was perpetuated by systemic causes . 
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas . 
At the end of the three-year period , it would be possible to evaluate the degree to which the objectives had been attained and on that basis decide whether work on enterprise development represented an important contribution to development and therefore whether it should form part of the elements presented for ministerial consideration at UNCTAD X . In short , work on an enterprise development strategy must be based on a strategic vision , the elements of the strategy must contribute to growth and development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability , and the strategy must be amenable to evaluation . 
This could be achieved through a summary report which would be compiled and coordinated by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and submitted to the General Assembly in accordance with paragraph 5 ( e ) ( ii ) of resolution 48 / 218 B . The report would be based on submissions from the operational funds and programmes which would be forwarded to the Office by their executive heads after discussion and approval , as appropriate , by the respective governing bodies .

Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
First , the new and equitable global partnership must be based on equality and recognize that there was no single model for development that was universally applicable ; since the world was characterized by diversity , there must be respect for the economic and social development model chosen by each country and any attempt to use aid as a leverage for exerting political pressure must be abandoned .

Recalling the recommendations from the Malm Ministerial Declaration 2 / that the 2002 World Summit should review the requirements for a greatly strengthened institutional structure for international environmental governance based on an assessment of future needs for an institutional architecture that has the capacity to effectively address wide-ranging environmental threats in a globalizing world , and that United Nations Environment Programmes role in this regard should be strengthened and its financial base broadened and made more predictable ,  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
My delegation remains convinced that an independent East Timor , established in democratic pluralism based on the national pact referred to by Mr . Ramos-Horta , should be assisted by the United Nations and the entire international community .  
Thus , the sanctions , the search for a political solution , and the humanitarian and economic efforts all need to be taken as a whole and pursued as parts of an integrated strategy leading to a broad based and responsible government in Afghanistan .  
They heard each member of the Council make comments and ask relevant and specific questions of the President of Rwanda , namely concerning the presence of forces of aggression on the Congolese territory , the permeability of common borders and the need to build a free , secure and democratic Rwandan society based on human rights , equality and respect for diversity .  
In conclusion , as East Timor grows into a full-fledged sovereign and independent nation , the international community has a solemn responsibility to support measures including building bridges of understanding towards achieving reconciliation , strengthening the foundations of government based on democratic and transparent practices , and promoting capacity-building programmes .  
As far as France is concerned , this settlement must be based , on the one hand , on the reaffirmation and full recognition of Israels irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders , and , on the other hand , on the establishment of a viable , independent and democratic Palestinian State , and this means the end of the occupation of Palestinian territories .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
Reinforcement and strengthening of the GCC process in terms of enhanced coordination , cooperation , interlinkage and integration , by adopting a unified strategy in the political , economic , security , military , social , information , cultural and scientific fields based on unity of purpose and a common destiny .  
Democracy is a system of universal values and is based on recognition of the inalienable nature of the dignity and equal value of all human beings ; everyone has the right to play an active role in social , professional and political life and to enjoy the right to development ;  
To ensure that the basic texts governing democratic life are based on a broad national consensus , while still in conformity with international standards , and that they be regularly evaluated and adapted ;  
The Nadi Framework is based on the premise that possession and use of firearms , ammunition , other related materials and prohibited weapons is a privilege conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety and that public safety will be enhanced by imposing strict controls on the import , possession and use of firearms , ammunition , other related materials and prohibited weapons .  
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
In my report to the Security Council , I underscored the need for a viable and sustainable financial mechanism and noted that a financial mechanism based on voluntary contributions will not provide the assured and continuous source of funding required for the operation of the Special Court ( S / 2000 / 915 , para .  70 ) .  
It would be unwise to suddenly replace a stable financial and budgetary system , which had evolved through experience and could be further improved , by another system based on untested assumptions and vague concepts which could be inappropriate for the United Nations .  
Unless resource management and development strategies based on space remote sensing and other information technology inputs consistent with societal demands and cultural practices were adopted on a worldwide scale , it would not be possible to ensure environmental security in the coming decades . 
It should establish an ad hoc working group , accountable to the Secretary-General of the United Nations , to study conditions and criteria to be established for such volunteer work , based on practical experiences ; consider legal , administrative and financial modalities ; and formulate proposals with a view to creating a legal framework conducive to their implementation .  
Families should be supported and empowered to fulfil their multiple functions and responsibilities and to realize their rights , with policies and programmes based on a functional and global approach to the family as basic provider of social security and protection .  
The Secretary-General endorses the proposed formula for determining the number and salary levels of resident auditors that should be deployed to selected peacekeeping missions , on the understanding that the formula would be used as a guideline and the actual requirements in each case would be based on a detailed assessment of the related risks and other relevant factors .  
The representative of New Zealand , noting the absence of a legal framework specific to internally displaced persons , stated that such persons were of course covered by international human rights law and that there was no excuse for States not to follow such international human rights principles and the legal guidance based on them as contained in the Guiding Principles ( S / PV . 4130 ) .  
He noted that the Paris Declaration of 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
In that sense , Peru endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications but believed that the measures covered by the Programme could be carried out only through effective international cooperation based on access to technology , the elaboration of specific projects for space activities and the transmission of processed information that would have a practical and direct effect on the sustainable development of States . 
It is our belief that the final goal of the implementation of the Dayton Accords should be the creation of a multi-ethnic , multicultural , united state of Bosnia and Herzegovina that is based on the democratic and humanitarian ideals of modern Europe and oriented in its development towards integration into the European Union and friendship and cooperation with other democratic States of the region .  
That is a severe disappointment , but it was a prudent decision based on the current and growing level of peacekeeping activity and the need for sufficient cash to cover the requirements for these ongoing missions .  
Reaffirm that national human rights institutions should be established following an appropriate and inclusive process of consultation and be independent , pluralistic and based on universal human rights standards ;  
At the operational level , it will be based on regular consultations and information sharing on the priorities established by national Governments and through intergovernmental processes with a view to enabling Africa to derive maximum benefit from the improved coordination of the activities undertaken by the agencies of the United Nations system .  
This will also include coordinating the development of common policies on humanitarian issues ; improving the management and practice of humanitarian coordination through the enhancement of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned ; ensuring that gender-sensitive strategies are incorporated in humanitarian action plans ; increasing support for and awareness of humanitarian assistance issues and international humanitarian law in the work of the United Nations and its Member States ; and intensifying resource mobilization .  
Efforts to establish an international enabling environment should be conducted in a spirit of partnership between developed and developing countries based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and taking into account the specific conditions of individual countries , in accordance with the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 .  
As has been the practice in the past , while the staffing of the Department is maintained at a total of 442 posts funded from the support account , provisions of general operating expenses are based on a lower figure of 357 since provision for the remaining 85 support account posts are being included within the respective provisions of the regular budget .  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;

A veritable industrial complex based on forced labour had grown up in the prisons , and the whites responsible for brutal crimes such as the murder of African immigrant Amadou Diallo went unpunished .  
While Lebanon is proceeding to rebuild the infrastructure destroyed by Israel during the 22 years of the occupation and to meet its responsibility to provide vital services to the villages and areas liberated from Israeli occupation , Israel is confronting us with further threats based on allegations and delusions in preparation for the launching of fresh attacks on Lebanese territory on the fabricated grounds that Lebanon has set about diverting the course of the Hasbani river and depriving Israel of its water .  
Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , peace , democracy , justice , equality , rule of law , pluralism , development , better standards of living and solidarity ,  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
By its decision 1 / 1 , the Committee adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 , a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process as contained in the annex to that decision , on the understanding that this preliminary agenda was of an indicative nature and would evolve during the substantive process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .

The list that follows is not exhaustive , but the Panels choice was based on the crucial roles played by these persons and their direct involvement in either providing support , entertaining networks or facilitating the exploitation of natural resources within the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
The programme further aims at reinforcing the role of the United Nations as the unique worldwide forum for the discussion and resolution , with the participation of all relevant actors , of human rights matters of international concern , through its support for human rights bodies and organs and its adoption and progressive implementation of an improved treaty monitoring system , which deals with multiple reporting obligations and is based on a comprehensive national approach .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .

Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,

It is saddening that at the dawn of the twenty-first century and the strides that humanity has made in constructing a new international environment , where respect for international law and legality and full protection of human rights constitute the cornerstone of the policy of States , the Turkish Republic continues to behave in a manner reminiscent of some of the worst periods of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries , with an anachronistic approach in its relations with its neighbours based on threats and the use of force . 
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
This phenomenon of multiple job-holding is considered to be on the increase based on the observation of a local pollster , who points out that an increasing number of Jamaicans are being forced into additional employment on a part-time basis as a measure to counter the rising cost of living .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
The present report is based on the replies from 12 governmental agencies which were received by mid April 2001.1 A shorter version of the questionnaire was transmitted to relevant international organizations , specialized agencies and cooperative organizations ; 21 responses were received . 2 Respondents provided information on the action taken in the following areas :

When the States adhered to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in 1996 , they pledged to respect and guarantee to all individuals living in their territory , and who are under their jurisdiction , the rights recognized by the Covenant with no discrimination based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , social status , birth , or any other criteria .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
His delegation understood that the Secretariat intended to submit a revised budget estimate based on the priorities for the coming months , as identified by the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General , and on the timing and budgetary implications of the forthcoming Kosovo-wide elections .  
While the fixed-fee approach reflected in the Regulations governing polymetallic nodules acts as an incentive to claim the maximum permissible area , a variable fee , based on the size of the area , would operate as an incentive to keep claims as small as possible and would discourage speculative ventures .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Convinced of the fundamental importance of universal accession or ratification to and full implementation of [ the / our ] obligations arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instrument to eliminate racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance [ based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin ] ,

The Commission also called for the condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination , and for concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services , in order to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls .  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The challenge of building functioning institutions safeguarding fundamental human rights and capable of supporting a multi-ethnic society based on democratic principles and tolerance is a major one .  
To contribute to the search for a common denominator based on the peace agreements that would win the support of broad sectors of the population , MINUGUA , at the request of the parties , held an extensive round of consultations through which it discovered that there was some readiness on the part of sectors of society to work together on specific issues .  
The process used to determine such a rate must be transparent and based on clear , empirical data , since any ad hoc figure that was calculated in an irrational or obscure manner and not grounded in solid , empirical data might result in inconsistent results .  
Takes note of the views of the Secretariat regarding the possibility of reviewing , subject to future experience , the procedures for settlement of liability for damages for major equipment used by one country and owned by another country , and decides that the liability for damage to major equipment used by one country and owned by another should be based on the relevant provisions of their memoranda of understanding in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the United Nations ;  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
The new democratic Governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the Republic of Croatia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have each pledged , and begun to act upon , commitments to constructive bilateral and regional relations based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State .

This dire prognosis is based on the analysis of the current epidemiological situation in Georgia and neighbouring countries , all of which are experiencing widespread drug abuse , increased migration , and lack of disposable medical instruments and diagnostic test systems , among other factors .  Currently , Georgia is still within the so-called window of opportunity for preventing the massive spread of HIV / AIDS .  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
[ 10 ] After considering information in States parties reports concerning the ways in which individuals are identified as being members of a particular racial or ethnic group , the Committee stated that such identification should , if no justification existed to the contrary , be based upon self-identification by the individual concerned . 
The simple fact that a particular category of the population suffers from underprivileged economic or social conditions does not mean that , in order to upgrade its material position , any distinction based on a characteristic defining the group should be considered legitimate , even if the ground is irrelevant as a basis of distinction with regard to a particular right .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ;  
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
Urges States to take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;

Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .  
The fact that General Assembly resolution 55 / 5 stated that the reduction of the maximum assessment rate should have no automatic implication for the specialized agencies merely confirmed that the latter enjoyed financial autonomy and that , in the case of UNIDO , the resolution did not prevail over the relevant provisions of the UNIDO Constitution , which in Article 15.2 stated that the scale of assessments should be based to the extent possible on the scale most recently employed by the United Nations .  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the supreme chief of the Taliban , asking him not to issue the decree because of its discriminatory nature and stressing that measures designed to protect minorities must be consistent with the relevant international human rights standards , which were based on the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of religion or belief .  
In its resolution 54 / 135 of 17 December 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant international organizations , specialized agencies , funds and programmes , and in consultation with Member States , to prepare a comprehensive report on the situation of rural women and challenges faced by them , based , inter alia , on the outcome of an expert group meeting , which would draw from the contributions and case studies provided by experts from various regions and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-sixth session .  
The Commission had placed emphasis on raising the value of traditional knowledge , on promoting sustainable use of genetic resources , and on ensuring equitable benefit sharing in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based products , and it had recommended that the international community explore minimum standards for an internationally recognized sui generis system . 
Djibouti has a dual economy , characterized by an important informal sector that serves a population with weak purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , which serves a population with strong purchasing power that depends almost entirely on imports .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
He further requested that the Working Group pay attention to and report on the emerging standards based on precedent and existing legal instruments by which indigenous peoples and nations were seeking justice and reparations for the past and present abuses of mining and other corporations , including in the home countries of transnational corporations .  
While the United Front has recently stated its commitment to a negotiated political settlement based on the right of the Afghan people to self-determination , a position supported by those Afghans supporting the convening of an emergency loya jirga , the Taliban remain of the view that the selection by ulemas of Mullah Mohammad Omar as Amir-ul Momenin with lifelong untrammelled powers has already adequately expressed the wishes of the Afghan people .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .

In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
In order to accelerate the steps towards making a leap in training , we should extract from past " exhibitions " and " briefings " on real technology based on existing computer networks to train the troops , and rely on all training bases ' extensive opening up of simulated training to enable the troops to become familiar with and master information technology and equipment as soon as possible .  At the " pre-reality line " simulating real combat , we should promote informational training .  
From this , our army 's development , based on support , has proceeded only on a shrunken scale , weakening the military 's function in managing society ; the larger development trend has already gradually realized self-support capabilities integrated with socialized support .  
In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .

Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .

Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .

The factors include whether the alternative treatment practice covers a discrete area of activity displaying some homogeneity , whether the practice involves applying a defined body of knowledge and practice based on evidence of efficacy , the prevalence of such practice and the risk incurred when a patient receives such treatment modalities .  
The current numbers of male and female Administrative Officers filling these posts are set out as follows - ( c ) The promotion of officers in the Administrative Officer Grade is essentially based on performance in the present rank and objective assessment of ability to assume greater responsibilities and undertake more demanding duties in the next higher rank .

"  
" Hong Kong provides an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , as well as free flow of capital and information .  These competitive edges make Hong Kong the most ideal place for business development for international investment banks and securities houses in the Greater China region , " said Mr Rowse .  
In response to the suggestion of the Staff Side of SCSC that the Government should restore an alleged " shortfall " in pay adjustment which has accumulated since 1989 , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that each civil service pay adjustment exercise is taken as a separate and independent exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time . 
In response to the suggestion of the staff side of SCSC that the Government should restore an alleged " shortfall " in pay adjustment which has accumulated since 1989 , the Chief Executive is also of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that each civil service pay adjustment exercise is taken as a separate and independent exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time .  
The civil service will continue to be subject to the prevailing civil service disciplinary system , under which allegations of misconduct against individual civil servants are determined through an impartial process based on consideration of factual evidence .

These include centre-based services ; outreaching services ; social and recreational services ; home help services ; and enhanced home and community care services which is a package of home and centre based services tailor made to meet the individual needs of frail elders . 
" After closing of the current prequalification exercise , we will prequalify no more than five candidates to participate in the forthcoming ' design and build ' contract tender exercise based on their technical , managerial and financial capability to fulfill the contract as well as design capability . " 
We need to develop a committed workforce of nurses who are capable of analytical thinking , and are ready to deliver high quality service based on updated professional knowledge and skills .  
Funded programmes can be grouped into two categories .  The first category is district based health promotional activities for elders such as health talks , educational classes , senior volunteer programmes and health ambassadors .  The other category is thematic programmes such as bird watching programmes for elders , sex education for elders , smoking cessation programmes , horticultural programmes and promotion of internet application .  
" The synergy of Hong Kong and the Mainland , based on a unique ethnic relationship and an increasing economic interaction and integration , makes the city well poised as a strategic partner for international enterprises to establish a foothold in that vast market , " Mr Leung said . 
" The legal proceedings brought by a public housing tenant challenging the Authority 's decision to defer the rent review has raised important questions on an important premise upon which the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee have been based , i.e . , the HA is under no statutory obligation to review public rental housing rent every three years , nor is it required by law to maintain the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) below 10% at all times , " Mr Ng said . 
And it will not condone any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , colour , descent , or national or ethnic origin , which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life , " Ms Chan explained .  
" Much of our future success , like our past success , will depend on Hong Kong 's unchanging fundamentals : free flow of capital and information , an independent judiciary based on the rule of law , clean and efficient government , and a simple and low tax regime .  Add to this , no exchange controls , transparent regulation and state-of-the-art telecommunications , " Mr Ma said .  
To ensure that suitable card readers are widely available on the market by the time the new Smart ID Cards are rolled out , ITSD has recently completed a survey among personal computer and smart card suppliers , based on the operational and technical features of the new Smart ID Card .  
Forecasts in this web page are based on the official weather information provided by national meteorological authorities .  Apart from text , the information is also presented in simple graphic for easy appreciation .  
Under our proposals , which are based on the existing law , ' protected information ' only includes five tightly defined categories of information relating to : ( i ) security and intelligence ; ( ii ) defence ; ( iii ) international relations ; ( iv ) relations between the Central Authorities of the PRC and Hong Kong ; and ( v ) the commission of offences and criminal investigations .  
This is because the form of the libation cup coincides with the natural tapering form of the horn , making the best use of this very rare material .  A second reason is based on the common belief that the cup may exude antidotal and mind-pacifying medicinal properties of the rhinoceros horn into the liquid it contains .  
It has a world-class financial and banking system with a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , a simple and low tax regime , an independent judiciary based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , as well as free flow of capital and information . "  
The improved mechanism would comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments .  
" We shall in consultation with staff develop , on the basis of the existing mechanism , an improved civil service pay adjustment which should comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments , " Mr Wong said . 
Specifically , we will review our social security schemes to ensure a basic safety net for needy elders and people with disabilities , assist the unemployed and the needy to tide over their short term financial difficulties , adopt more vigorous and rational gate-keeping for access to services based on defined need , and re-engineer services to strengthen integration and networking .  
The direct income based taxation system in Hong Kong consists of three individual taxes , Property Tax , Salaries Tax and Profits Tax , each of which is separately assessed independently of the others .  Only Salaries Tax carries an entitlement to deduct personal allowances and to be charged at progressive rates of tax ; the other taxes are charged at a fixed single rate of tax with no deductions for personal allowances .  
The new mechanism will comprise the periodic conduct of pay level surveys , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology as well as an effective means for implementing both upward and downward pay adjustments .  
" The Steering Committee has accepted that the proposed major arts and cultural facilities should be of world class standard , should complement existing and future cultural facilities in Hong Kong and should be based broadly on the conceptual plan submitted by the team led by Foster and Partners , " he said .  
Ladies and gentlemen , I have enormous faith in our future .  That confidence is not based on wishful thinking .  It 's based on what I have just outlined - a clear understanding of our positioning , and a whole range of initiatives coming on stream over the next few years .  
The improved mechanism will comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward pay adjustments .  
Mr Passow continued , " The criteria for all awards was based on conversations by the editorial staff with consultants from the major accounting and financial service firms who monitor direct international investment flows and the tracking by Euromoney 's editorial staff of public information on the dollar amounts of deals in the Asia Pacific area .  
It stressed that both leaders were gratified by the continuous development in political , economic and technical relations between their countries . They shared identical ideals and aspirations , the communique stated , believing as they did that the foundation of traditional friendship , based on high moral principles and fraternal solidarity , was both firm and enduring . The king and the president reaffirmed the common cause of their countries and peoples in upholding peace , freedom and human rights and opposing all forms of aggression , oppression and prejudice .  
After graduation from college , he engaged in journalistic , cultural and educational work . Later , he served as an executive member of the party 's Taiwan provincial office based at Chang chow , Fukien province , and was elected a member of the party 's Sixth National Congress .  
As more and more people have moved into new homes in urban high-rise buildings , they have inevitably missed the natural environment of the countryside . To overcome this sense of loss , many apartment dwellers have turned to artificial gardens , complete with trees , flowers , hills , pavilions , bridges , ponds and flower pots usually based on the style of the Chinese traditional garden .  
For instance , at the front of the compound , Prof . Li and his students have decorated walls by creating splendid bronze reliefs based on stories in Chinese history which extol loyalty , filial piety , fidelity and justice ; such as Yuen Fei 's devotion to his country and Hua Mu-lan going to war in place of her aged and sick father .  
The design of the poster based on a famous Chinese painting , ching ming shang ho tu ( Going upstream during the Tombsweeping Day ) featured 10 ancient musicians wearing clothes embroidered with the Chinese character meaning " courage " riding on horseback while playing all kinds of musical instruments .  
To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
He further remarked that the Chinese people place equal emphasis on human nature , reasonableness and law . The work of the mediation council is based on the first two considerations , and the agreements it makes possible must have legal standing . Mayor Lee said that the function of mediation councils is a unique feature in the nation 's political history . He is convinced that once the mediation council fully develops its role , people will no longer need to go to the courts to settle their disputes .  
The chair on display is covered in green upholstery , moves smoothly on casters and is meticulously carved with intricate floral designs . Called a lady 's chair by the maker , it is based on an original from Britain 's Victorian era , and has a " gentleman 's chair " companion piece . It is one of many included in what is in effect a renaissance of European furniture styles in Taiwan .  
The majority of the first settlers were engaged in farming . The rugged terrain , and damp climate encouraged the cultivation of tea and oranges . The past 30 years have seen Taiwan evolve from an agricultural based economy to that of an industrial-based nation . Industrial development in the Taipei basin spurred the growth of many satellite communities such as Yung Ho , Chung Ho and Pan Ch'iao .  
Later the action of plate tectonics ( based on the theory of continental drift ) caused the island to separate . During the recurring periods of glaciation ( from 10,000 to 25,000 years ago ) the waters receded from the Taiwan Straits leaving a natural land bridge which provided a corridor for numerous bird and animal species .  
All came to be divided into three types , based on the geographical areas of north , middle and south . Beginning in 1975 , the Ministry of Education began the work of unifying sign languages on Taiwan .  
Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
We should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an even more active and responsible attitude . From central to local government , from representative bodies to the administrative agencies , all should make a thorough self-review , based on actual needs , and strengthen and improve where required , to fortify the substance and function of democracy .  
We must , however , proceed with extreme caution in our mainland policy . For obvious reasons , our first concern must continue to be our national security . And our policy of no official contact with the Chinese Communist regime will remain unchanged . President Lee Teng-hui summed it up well when he declared that our mainland policy can not be based on a romantic longing , but is a serious task that must be carefully undertaken .  
Then the quality of daily human existence for everyone will improve immeasurably as we march towards the turn of the century . . Establishing a Science CityAll our cities of today will eventually be transformed into science cities . Our economic infrastructure is based on the development of industrial science and technology . This goes hand-in-glove with the modernization of public facilities .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
In the process of economic development , the government should actively invest more in social welfare , and should , based on the particular circumstances of our country , learn from the experiences of more advanced countries and design a concrete program for the welfare of all the people , so that our citizens can live and work in safety and harmony , and the aged , weak , and handicapped can receive the care they need .  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution . Overseas Chinese newspaper proprietors encouraged revolutionary sentiment ; Singapore Chinese Chang Yung-fu lent his home as a meeting place for the Tung Meng Hui , and Sun Yatsen stayed there when he visited Singapore ; Vietnam-based overseas Chinese bought ammunition to assist nationalist forces at the Battle of Huanghuakang in the year 1911 , and in that battle some dozen of them gave their lives for the revolutionary cause .  
Some of the demands overlap with standard government regulations , but even more of them are based on special local needs , such as a requirement that the firm adhere to effluent standards higher than the national standard , that an environmental impact statement be drawn up , that an inspection team be set up , that the factory reach certain standards within a certain period of time or else be shut down .  
The theory of the " malignant / benign polarity " might sound reasonable enough , and the various traditional Chinese occult sciences based on it , such as geomancy ( examining this polarity in spatial terms ) or Chinese medicine 's concern with regulating cold and heat , may be backed by crystal clear logical argument .  
American fast food came to Taiwan in 1984 in the shape of McDonald 's , whose first Taipei outlet achieved a record turnover for the worldwide chain in the first week of opening . They not only encouraged other Western fast food businesses to set up shop here , but also set the pace for local fast food outlets such as Chicken House , Ting Kua Kua and Han Hua , whose common features are based on McDonald 's example of clean , bright surroundings , hygienic food and speedy service with a smile .  
And if you make windfall profits on speculation , then that 's just smart planning . " But the two main public policies for returning price rises to the public - - buying land up according to assessed value and taxes , also based on assessed value - - are not able to fulfill their function because of the huge gap between the standard - - assessed prices - - and the actual market prices .  
I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations . Here it mostly seems to be that a professor or school puts forward a goal that suits his or its particular strengths . For example , the recent relatively major plans to develop satellites , aerospace and astronomy , seem to have been embarked upon after hearing just a few people 's suggestions .  
Even though they gave their lives in the air , since they never graduated , the monthly compensation afforded to their families is based on that of a sergeant , not an official pilot - - a mere NT $ 10,000 or so a month , only enough to reopen the wounds of grief of their aging parents . Air force pilots share a passion for flying , and they know that in making their dream come true they may eventually have to pay the ultimate price .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
The student-teacher relationship was based on shared convictions and sometimes involved mutual benefit , and thus " a man 's influence [ was ] measured by the number of his followers , " and in Chinese history there have been innumerable instances of " factional strife " and " protecting one 's own faction and attacking others . "  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
In fact , with reference to existing prenatal diagnostic techniques for genetic disorders , the ROC Department of Health has issued administrative orders warning doctors that conducting fetal gender tests on pregnant women , or performing abortions based on the fetal gender , would make them guilty of malpractice under the Medical Practice Law and the Medical Treatment Law . But there are still gynecology clinics whose signboards blatantly carry such wording as " CVS testing , 100% accurate . "  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
But the nearby culture of Qi has gradually been all but forgotten by history . Lu civilization was based on agriculture . Agricultural civilization tends toward the soft , the delicate , the conservative . It stresses ethics , human sentiment , stability , the golden mean and morality .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
It was July and August , the height of summer . Our rough and ready vessel had no cabin to rest in , and only incomplete equipment . But everyone , based on their fondness for whales and dolphins , overcame the intense sun and the unsettling waves . We all survived seasickness and sunburn , and learned how to get a firm position on the rolling deck so we could take clear photos .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Its methodology is based upon today 's Voluntary High School Admissions Program , which adopts a five-level grade scoring system . ( This program , implemented in an experimental phase in 1990 , allows participating junior high students to advance to high school based on written application forms and school grades , rather than performance on the joint entrance exam . )  
However , as in the example of author Lin Ching-hsuen , people are often wrongly categorized based on these test results , and more and more doubts are being cast on this type of testing . This has been particularly true in recent years with Taiwan 's active promotion of special gifted and talented programs . Because such a large proportion of gifted students are chosen based on IQ tests , the question of the practicality and fairness of such measures has stirred up a great deal of controversy .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
Moreover , Islam 's greatest emotional power is in the Qur'an . " It clears the mind and teaches the true way , " he says . The faithful believe that the Qur'an is a record of what the Prophet Mohammed received from Allah . Mohammed was illiterate ; the Qur'an was compiled by his successors based on what Mohammed told them , and completed after his death , in the seventh century CE .  
Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
The fundamental principles behind the operation of a synchrotron are based in electromagnetic theory : when electrons moving at near the speed of light are subjected to a magnetic field , they can then be deflected to create strong radiation in a tangential direction-namely , synchrotron radiation .  
" Having aboriginal people , who have always been the subjects of anthropological study , operating the camera themselves is a revolution in the history of documentary film making , " exclaims Wang . It is of course a separate issue whether or not documentaries based on their own subjective points of view will be " better , " but from a human rights point of view , granting the subjects of research the right to speak for themselves is definitely to be encouraged .  
As for how serious the situation should become before closing schools , Chen Chien-jen , a professor at the Graduate Institute of Epidemiology at NTU 's School of Public Health , pointed out that judgment about the seriousness of an outbreak requires an objective decision based on an understanding of the communicability of a disease , the number and density of people who are infected , and the rate of secondary infection , as well as other epidemiological data , and should not be based on a subjective considerations .  
" Generally speaking , based on the production process , dZi beads ought to count as a kind of " etched agate " [ agate to which alkaline metal has been applied and heated to create a surface for etching designs ] , " Chang Hung-shih explains .  
In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait . According to the ROC Ministry of Defense , in recent years the PRC has continually seen Taiwan 's new generation of military capabilities as its primary hypothetical enemy and undertaken numerous military exercises based on this premise . In addition , the national defense report just issued by the PRC emphasized repeatedly that the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan could not be excluded .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
These expensive anti-aging therapies begin with a thorough physical evaluation . In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Lu Tien-yen , head of the Taipei Modern Painters Group and a participant in the Hong Kong show , explains that traditional art is based largely on feeling , and it is easy to appreciate its aesthetic . Modern art , on the other hand , is rational and logical , and the theoretical background to a work is vital .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life .

considered the complexities of the situation described above , and based on a careful analysis by my military advisers , I am convinced that a mechanized division of two brigades , with combat capability , air support and a strong mobile , armoured reserve , would be required .  
The solution should also be a comprehensive one based on prevention , mitigation of damage to the environment and the search for sustainable solutions , which should be based on the political will to protect , defend and promote human rights , guarantee the participation of citizens in government and create an enabling environment for economic and social progress .  
The standards on indigenous rights to be elaborated by the Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights should promote peaceful and constructive solutions based on the principles of multicultural societies , inter-ethnic understanding and harmony and tolerance .  Respect for the rights of indigenous people did not prejudice the territorial integrity of States , but strengthened it and prevented violent conflicts .  
the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
that connection , her delegation supported the new multi-dimensional international strategy adopted by the General Assembly in 1993 which was based on a balanced effort to reduce supply and demand and on the promotion of comprehensive national drug control plans integrated in economic and social planning .  
convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing , and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
Nations intervention should be confined to situations which posed an unquestionable threat to international peace and security and where Security Council decisions were based on the clearly expressed support of the majority of Member States , rather than on the political exigencies of a few States , no matter how powerful they might be .  
asks the United Nations Security Council to ensure the full implementation of that agreement by adopting a feasible mandate based on the establishment of an effective provisional administration and the deployment of a credible international force equipped with sufficient resources .  
included harmony among the various national groups and political stability based on the equal rights of all citizens , the unity of its multinational people and the resolution of all State issues through peaceful , democratic means .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
They are also aimed at creating a lean , efficient , highly motivated and dutiful civil service , based on the job requirements and carefully evaluated professional requirements of each Ministry and public institution .  
It is my delegation 's hope that our deliberations today , as well as the current intensive rounds of diplomatic efforts , will help bring about such an outcome , for the vicious cycle of violence and bloodshed which has bedeviled the Middle East must be broken and a comprehensive and just peace based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) must be realized .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .  
The main objective of the review was to obtain assurance that the assumptions used in the programme budget were based on sound financial and economic principles and to suggest refinements in budgetary techniques and modifications in format with a view to achieving realistic and transparent budgetary proposals .  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
In this manner , we are seeking to include Africa in all its aspects on the international agenda , stressing , on the one hand , the scale and economic potential of the African continent , which is deserving of a new approach and a new model for dialogue , and , on the other hand , encouraging African countries to embark on their own process of development based on the promotion of peace , democracy , stability and economic and social progress .  
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States . Disarmament , sustainable development , enhancement of the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are priority issues that affect the security and well-being of peoples throughout the world .  
After having solved a prolonged domestic conflict by political means , we Salvadorans have many challenges before us which can be summed up in a few words : the achievement of a lasting , stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law that will enable us to achieve social peace and the building of a new El Salvador .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
The various protagonists must understand that only a new political agreement , based on ordinary common sense , with respect for the intangible principles of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , will contribute to an acceptable solution to all .  
To complete its programme of building a State based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all citizens of Benin would enjoy a certain minimum standard of living , the Government of Benin wishes to benefit further from the support and assistance of the entire international community .  
The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
Responsibility for social development is based on two pivotal factors : national responsibility and collective commitment , as reflected in the combined efforts of the international community .  
The characteristic distinction of the late twentieth century is that relations among nations are based on interrelated , mutual and diverse interests in various political , economic and social fields .  
The Sudan is of the view that the structure of the international community , which is based on ideological , political and cultural diversity and pluralism , prompts us all to accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmony and diversity among nations become the vehicle for interaction and dialogue within the framework of pursuing national interests in the context of the international system .  
Given the new challenges of these final years of our millennium , the International Court of Justice today , half a century after its founding , has become the body to which States , both large and small , and international organizations are turning increasingly to seek justice or to request the Court 's authoritative opinion on disputes , differences or legal problems that arise or create differences between them , convinced that the only valid and lasting solution is one based on law .  
Chowdhury ( Bangladesh ) : At its fiftieth session the General Assembly reaffirmed the commitments made by the Heads of the State or Government at Copenhagen and decided to give highest priority to the national , regional and international policies and actions for the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition , based on full participation by all .  
Furthermore , my Government places particular emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups , such as the disabled , in the process of social development , in the firm conviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society can be realized only when all people , irrespective of their physical or mental disadvantages , are able to pursue a life of happiness and dignity based on stability and equality .  
It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .  
The Government has formulated specific and concrete plans aimed at modernizing the productive structures of the country , in order to legitimize a new economic plan through genuine proposals for social development , based on the concept of social solidarity and good governance .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
There are still many who need to be convinced that nuclear technology is the inevitable option for satisfying the energy needs of developing countries and that it is worthwhile supporting nuclear-technology based programmes and activities also in the fields of fresh water , food , health and the environment .  
Despite a large degree of convergence on many of the issues that will be addressed by this convention , we feel constrained to reiterate that , for countries like India , whose nuclear programme is based on a closed fuel cycle , it would not be possible to consider including spent fuel in a convention dealing with the safety of radioactive waste management .  
This obliges States , within the framework of the United Nations system , to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly engage in management activities in the Organization based on the new cultural , economic and geographical reality made up of broad functional regional areas .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
With its unique approach , the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was aimed at renewing the commitment of African countries and the international community to an agenda for the sustainable social and economic development of Africa in a spirit of global partnership based on shared responsibilities .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
I therefore wish to express Colombia 's support for the draft resolution before us , based on our commitment to the principle of respect for international law and to help promote freer , more vigorous and more transparent international trade allowing developing countries to strive for economic and social development .  
Russia , firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and international navigation , supports and intends to broaden normal economic and commercial ties with Cuba , based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage , and to put them into effect in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms .  
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
The successful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relations based on internationally accepted principles can not be replaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitious regional associations .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
This is particularly true since the United Nations Charter , in our view a view shared by many others still represents a major instrument governing international life , and since any international order , be it old or new , must be based on a solid foundation that respects rights , determines obligations and opens the door to an era of interaction among societies on the basis of acceptance and understanding , not imposition or oppression .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
Peace in the Middle East will not be comprehensive or lasting until a strict regime for regional security is established , based on arrangements that provide equal security for all parties with minimum levels of armament .  
We are confident that the same initiative , determination and courage that the parties demonstrated in forging a historical framework for the peace and stability of the region can likewise be invoked to pave a new avenue built upon cooperation and coexistence that will eventually lead to a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) , 338 ( 1973 ) and 425 ( 1978 ) .  
Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .  
Today , at a time when the reform of the system is the subject of such intense discussion , our national experience may perhaps be useful , as it is an example of cooperation that is at once respectful and dynamic , based fundamentally on internal efforts with appropriate external help .  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
An annual analytical report on the thematic issues before the Commission , in accordance with the multi-year work programme , including , as far as possible , progress made in national and international implementation and including progress made by the Bretton Woods institutions , other United Nations specialized agencies and other relevant entities , based on available existing data and statistics ;  
An [ annual ] analytical report on the thematic issues before the Commission , in accordance with the multi-year work programme , including , as far as possible , progress made in national [ and international ] implementation , [ including United Nations specialized agencies and other relevant entities and the Bretton Woods institutions , ] based on available existing data and statistics ;  
Stresses that ( reducing / eradicating ) poverty can be achieved ( in each country only ) on the basis of a ( clear and lasting / strong ) political will ( of the State based on national consensus / at the national and international levels ) and directed in particular towards promoting more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and equal access to productive resources and social services ;  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
This is based on existing data sets and uses two independent variables - general fertility rates and proportion of births that are assisted by a trained person - to predict values for countries with no sound national estimate of maternal mortality .  
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
Non-governmental organizations , particularly those in the north , were doing a remarkable job in the fields of advocacy and protection , and , thanks to the joint action of the international community , States and non-governmental organizations , international public opinion was becoming favourable to the idea of controlling and combating all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief .  
The proper way to respond to attitudes of reservation regarding religious freedom was through patient and resolute dialogue , based on facts and the participation of all parties concerned , operating in the framework of internationally established norms and seeking to determine possible action and to plan for the longer term .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Responding to questions raised by the Committee with respect to article 1 , she noted that exemptions from the principle of equality were based on objective criteria and precise rules formulated as laws following broad consultations with institutional and other partners .  Their purpose was to permit certain territorial adaptations in the organization of the principles recognized in the Constitution ; the principles themselves could not be changed .  
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
In line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , measures are being taken to make the human rights machinery : ( a ) more effective and cost efficient ; ( b ) able to act swiftly and to respond appropriately to human rights situations ; ( c ) stronger , through international cooperation in the field of human rights , based on mutual confidence ; and ( d ) more transparent and understandable to the outside world .

Concerns of Member States , while often based upon similar scientific and socio-economic premises , are voiced by different governmental representatives in different intergovernmental forums and in different ways , depending upon the constituencies , with the result that there is a lack of coherent policy within the United Nations system ( at global , regional and national levels ) ;  
Adopt an enabling legal and regulatory framework based on an enhanced knowledge , understanding and acceptance of existing practices and land delivery mechanisms so as to stimulate partnerships with the private business and community sectors , specifying recognized types of land tenure and prescribing procedures for the regularization of tenure , where needed ;  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .  
We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
Bearing in mind also that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;

Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
Review and approval of the budgetary requirements for backstopping activities at Headquarters in subsequent years would be based on actual workload experience of the backstopping requirements of the prior year and projected workload for the next year , taking into account the number , scope , scale and complexity of active , completed and closed peace-keeping missions supported .  
They reaffirmed their commitment to work cooperatively towards achieving the prime objective of the Programme of Action which is to arrest the further deterioration in the socio-economic situation of the least developed countries , to reactivate and accelerate growth and development in these countries and , in the process , to set them on the path of economic growth and sustainable development based on shared responsibility and strengthened partnership .

Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of the International Conference on Central American Refugees and in the new subregional development strategy , the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America ;  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
A supportive national environment and a favourable international climate are necessary conditions for achieving economic growth , and a supportive national environment must be based on pragmatic policies in which Governments can no longer be assumed to be paramount economic agents .  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;

The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
These agreements constitute a starting point for a hemisphere-wide position on sustainable development - the cornerstone of a cooperative alliance among the States of the Americas in their common search for a better quality of life for their peoples , based on integrated , mutually reinforcing economic , social and environmental objectives .

With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented by measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The somewhat positive performance by the service sectors is based on growth in the financial sector and , to a lesser extent , in community and personal services , as the preliminary figures for the remaining service sectors show negative movement .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable .

The Commission also recalled that the current level of the ceiling ( 25 per cent of net salary ) was based on an administrative decision and that a reduction of the ceiling would be beneficial to duty stations with a large non-pensionable component since a lesser proportion of income would be considered non-pensionable and the relationship between income while in service and income after service would improve . 
The Parties believe that it is essential to continue to make joint coordinated efforts with a view to establishing , in the area within the purview of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , bilateral and multilateral international relations based on the generally accepted principles and norms of international law ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,

A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
In this transitional stage , lasting only six months , the late Mr . Ghafoorzai intended and was steadfast in his determination to convene the grand national decision-making assembly and the formation of a broad-based inclusive government based on a democratic constitution .  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
In this connection , it will be recalled that , consistent with established practice , the revised appropriation for 1996-1997 reflects actual exchange rates experienced in the first year of the biennium ( 1996 ) and projected rates for the second year ( 1997 ) based on the rate realized in December 1996 .  
On the contrary , genuine peace must be based on respect for the rule of law , on the acceptance of the solidarity and interdependence of all States and on the common desire to move dynamically forward towards the solution of the critical problems of dire poverty , disease , unemployment , illiteracy and economic and social inequality among peoples and nations .

We continue to draw vital sustenance from what is , after all , a West Indian partnership rooted in a shared love for , and practice of , democracy , a democracy that is not resting on its laurels , but that is engaged now in a process of revitalization based on the urgent search for collective economic security and social advance .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
However , we know that we can rely on international cooperation , founded not only on solidarity , but on mutual interest and partnership , to overcome the difficulties confronting us , to support our efforts at economic and social recovery , to build a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to construct a free , democratic , modern and prosperous nation .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
On the question of health , the Government has undertaken to rationalize the current programmes carried on under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Health and Population and to replace the traditional vertical approach with a more effective , regionally integrated strategy based on providing a minimum service , estimated to cost 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
The issues he articulated the imperative of development cooperation based on common concerns ; shared values ; solidarity and responsibility to each other ; the need for more resolute action at the international level to address the problem of widening global inequalities and marginalization are issues that require broad debate . 
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
We have consistently extended our firm support to this legal regime , which has paved the path to securing our common goal of ensuring long-term , stable and sustainable living resources of the vast oceans and seas based on cooperation , mutual benefit and shared responsibility .  
The formula based on geographical representation shifts the emphasis of the entire reform process towards a replacement of the former ideologized bipolar world by a new bipolarity of North-South , which runs counter to a balanced perception of the objectives which have been laid out , which take into account the interests of all geographic regions .  
This reservation is based on the decision of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers to suspend Arab participation in the multilateral committees until tangible progress is achieved in the peace process , particularly on the bilateral tracks , and until the Israeli Government has fulfilled its commitment to implement the signed agreements and obligations already subscribed to in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and other resolutions .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
Our unique fair share approach , which is based on consideration of the three Es environmental protection , economic development and social equity is designed to ensure adequate and clean supplies of water for all .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
The project has assembled a set of cross-nationally comparable depersonalized microdata sets based on the 1990 round of national population and housing censuses , which will be used to study the social and economic conditions of older persons in a selected number of ECE member countries .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
In that context , the initiative of the IMF Interim Committee and the IMF Development Committee , which at their April 1996 meeting proposed a new framework of action to resolve the debt problems of poor heavily indebted countries , is a real breakthrough , because that initiative is based on a comprehensive approach to the solution of the debt problem that recognizes that all the main creditors ( bilateral and multilateral ) of a particular country should cooperate and coordinate their contributions to the alleviation of the recipient 's debt burden . 
Her Government 's approach to advancing gender equality was based on the recognition that gender was a factor in the nation 's current social , economic , cultural and political systems and that the unequal status of women had its genesis in and was perpetuated by systemic causes . 
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle .

Although the current scale of assessments had been blamed by some for the Organizations financial difficulties , that scale had been based on extensive negotiations among all Member States and had proved to be fair and reasonable in practice , since it basically reflected the Members capacity to pay .  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .

Any other group or delegation was also free to enrich the debate , bearing in mind the spirit of the report of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD to UNCTAD X . All of that work had been conducted , not in a spirit of sterile confrontation based on abstract principles , but out of a concern to do as much as possible , within the framework of the competences of UNCTAD , to improve the standard of living of people in developing countries . 
Discrimination based on race , colour , ethnic or national origin , xenophobia , religious hatred or intolerance is an increasing phenomenon in Europe and was perceived by participants as a potential source of conflict . 
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Such perceptions of flaws in the existing Accord have led to pressure for regulatory changes , and underlie the new initiative of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision for its reform . 16 The approach now envisaged rests on three pillars : minimum capital requirements , supervisory review of capital adequacy in accordance with specified qualitative principles , and market discipline based on the provision of reliable and timely information ( discussed in paras . 10-11 above ) . 
In that context , it was regrettable that Israel continued to apply inhumane practices against the Palestinian people of the occupied territories and to confiscate their land , water and other natural resources , in flagrant violation of the principle , based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law , that land and other resources could not legitimately be acquired by force .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .

Such rights , while falling short of reflecting the public policy of the forum State , were based on rules of mandatory law ( e.g . , the right to challenge the validity of an assignment on the ground that it was a preferential or fraudulent transfer ) .  
It was also noted that the Working Group might wish to clarify whether the term receivable included : damages for breach of contract ( liquidated or not ) ; interest for late payment ( contractual interest , statutory interest or interest liquidated in a court judgement ) ; sums payable as dividends ( present or future ) arising from shares ; and receivables based on arbitral awards .

The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
In its fourth area of concentration , the UNEP approach , which emphasized the need for cleaner production , changing consumption patterns and the potential risk of chemical products , was based on the belief that the international community must stimulate the development of environmentally friendly technologies .  
The final status of the concerned territories will later be determined through delimitation and demarcation ( based on colonial treaties and applicable international law ) , processes that are completely separate from the restoration of the status quo ante .  
The decision of the Appeals Chamber is based on the grounds that the period of the appellant 's provisional detention was impermissibly lengthy and violated the appellant 's right to be promptly charged pursuant to international standards and on the violation of his right to have an initial appearance before the trial chamber without delay .

While no effort should be spared to maintain that generally beneficial tendency towards a free market economy and liberalization , there was obviously an urgent need for much better regulation and supervision of the international financial system , based on common sets of norms and standards .  
Just as the Palestinian issue was at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict , the question of the Palestinian refugees was central to the future of the peace arrangements that would follow the conclusion of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace based on the relevant international resolutions and in particular General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) , which clearly affirmed the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and to be paid compensation for loss of property . 
You are , of course , aware of the economic embargo of the past nine years and of the fact that these years have been punctuated by constant military assaults , planned and carried out by the United States , targeting all aspects of life and based on the refusal of that country to allow the people of Iraq to live a life of dignity and exercise its free and independent will .

The minimum wage-fixing committee must divide the persons working in the private-sector occupation concerned into categories based on their degree of responsibility and the importance and requirements of their work , ranging from managerial , specialized and technical functions to simple and ordinary tasks , and must draw up a job description for each category .  
Due regard must also be paid to the need for consistency in classification , nomenclature , terminology and definitions and the committee 's minimum wage proposals must be based on those to which an average skilled and competent worker is entitled , without gender-based discrimination , in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and the need to ensure that the wage is sufficient to meet the worker 's basic needs .  
The creation of a new relationship between Government , society and indigenous peoples must be based on respect for their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and on peaceful dialogue .  
Legislative acts adopted in recent years would make it possible to define the legal field for developing traditional types of economic activity as a basis for ensuring the viability of small indigenous peoples , developing local self-government and establishing relations based on partnership with governmental bodies at various levels .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
A practical programme of supply management to reduce excess supply , and to bring a better medium-term balance into the market , would need to be based on detailed assessments of trends in world demand for , and supply of , each of the major commodities experiencing persistently of depressed prices , the related trends in world stocks , and the expected future price trends , so as to determine the need for supply management in particular cases .

Israels ongoing policy of establishing settlements in the West Bank , including Jerusalem , and the other occupied Arab territories violated the resolutions adopted by the international community , which had declared those settlements illegal , obstructed a peaceful settlement , and were incompatible with the principles upon which the peace process was based .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

In 1997 , the National Programme for the Development of the Islands , and the Islands Act were adopted , based on the principle of sustainable development .  
Current international economic relations , being based on a unipolar policy and attempts by many wealthy States to impose an economic system or systems at the international level solely with a view to furthering their own interests , cause severe economic crises in the developing countries and are highly detrimental to the realization of the right to development .  
These earlier , elite , academic secondary schools ( based on the values of elitism and excellence ) and the later religious , popular schools bifurcated access to education ; schools were segregated by religion and class .  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Can the barriers to international trade for agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough for a poverty reduction strategy for rural areas of the developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm activities rather than on social programmes and safety nets ?  
Socialism had different related meanings : it represented an intellectual trend based on the critique of the developing bourgeois society ; it was the expression of a political and social movement aiming at reforms , influence or power ; and it referred to an ideal economic and social system intended to replace and overcome capitalism and its perceived flaws .  
Central imperative planning based on physical targets , that allowed fast initial structural change , soon came to be viewed as engendering critical rigidities and obstacles to endogenous technological and organizational change .  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Emphasizes that it is important for sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies to be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
However , it needed a human face , a people-centred approach based on improving the standard of living for all : poverty must be eradicated , peoples basic needs must be fulfilled and human rights must be promoted , with special attention to the status of women , children and disadvantaged groups . 
Given those circumstances , the ministers for foreign affairs of the Group of 77 had emphasized at the meeting held in New York on 24 September 1999 that , while globalization was often unpredictable and uneven , it could , if properly managed and based on strengthened cooperation , open the way for enduring and equitable growth at the international and national levels . 
On this basis , European Union support will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Somalia of the IGAD Partners Forum held in Rome on 19 and 20 October 1999 , and of its approach in favour of the establishment of regional governance structures based on participatory processes with the full involvement of civil society , which would provide a foundation for a future national government and for preserving the sovereignty and unity of Somalia .  
Moreover , accusations have been based on highly questionable expert reports , such as autopsies failing to meet technical requirements or ballistic tests performed on manipulated evidence , as in the Xamn case , or superfluous procedures , such as the ballistic test performed on hogs in the same case .  
His delegation believed that the social sector should be given high priority in the development process , since no economic development programme could be meaningful if it did not endeavour to eliminate hunger and illiteracy , provide adequate health services , improve the quality of life , and give due attention to human values .  22 .  The Government of Eritreas economic and social policies were based on the conviction that , to be successful , development must emphasize social development .  
As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
Similarly , the Special Rapporteur 's inquiries and analysis have convinced him that these persons were recruited , trained , hired and used by third parties of Cuban origin resident outside Cuba who , operating from outside Cuban territory and very possibly in collaboration with organizations opposed to President Fidel Castro 's Government and mainly based in Miami , planned the attacks and then directed and executed them using the mercenaries they had recruited , who entered Cuba posing as tourists . 
The Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights instruments are all based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination : everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in these instruments , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , birth or status .  
The new guidelines , intended for use by statistical compilers , data users and policy officials , will provide methodological standards for the compilation of statistics on external debt based on the international investment position framework and concept ; practical guidance for the compilation of these statistics ; and selected topics on the use of external debt data in the analysis of macroeconomic sustainability and external vulnerability .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
Responses to situations of such conflicts designed to reduce tensions and violence based on ethnic , racial or xenophobic conflicts may include : preventive diplomacy ; early-warning mechanisms ; mediation ; promotion of tolerance through human rights education ; support to democratic institutions through better representation of all segments of the society ; affirmative action ; promotion of multiculturalism .  
Although still in the development stage , the results-oriented annual reports ( ROARs ) have the potential of becoming an integral part of a viable framework for the future , one based on effective planning and execution and rooted in results-based management .  
In understanding the challenges faced by those who sought to engineer change in UNDP , it is crucial to recognize the deeply rooted , complacent culture of an organization based on entitlement that carried out a central coordinating and funding role within the United Nations system .  
The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
The Commission examined the issue in 1995 , 1996 , 1997 and 1998 , and reported its conclusions to the Assembly in its annual reports for those years . 4 The responses of the Commission were based on extensive consultations and studies in the context of which it had sought advice from ACPAQ , its expert technical body on post adjustment , and the views of a legal consultant and several legal experts , the Legal Counsel of the United Nations and the legal advisers of the organizations . 
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
It has for long been recognized that environmental policies have to be based on mostly regional even global interests , not just on shortsighted national ones adopted in the context of that obsolete understanding of sovereignty .  
He did not give us a descriptive report , but one based on his prerogatives , responsibilities and discretionary powers , putting forward a vision and initiatives to confront what he views as threats to international peace and security and ideas on how the United Nations could respond to political , humanitarian and human rights crises .  
Bearing in mind a steady tendency towards globalization at the international level , coupled with that of liberalization and economic reform at the national level , it is time to enhance international cooperation based on the principles of non-discrimination , open competitiveness , partnership and mutual benefit .  
The main task of this programme is to set up specific mechanisms aimed at the implementation of the principles of a socially oriented economy and at the enhancement of social policy based on the efficient use of existing resources .  
We are looking forward to even more close and constructive cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , so that together we can offer the world peace , stability and mutual understanding and create a world based on dialogue between civilizations , on conciliation and on respect for moral values and the rule of law in the relations between nations and peoples .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
On the occasion of the signing we were able to show him some of the progress we have made and reiterate our political will to work for a strengthened , effective and efficient safeguards system , based on an equitable regime that will lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
They include numerous illegal measures that interfere with the legitimate economic and commercial activities of foreign companies based outside United States jurisdiction , as well as complete prohibitions not only against the Republic of Cuba , but against all Cuban nationals , without exception , residing in Cuban territory , who are prevented from engaging in any transactions , while all of their property , deposits , savings , inheritances and pensions in the United States have been confiscated . 
We reaffirm our intention to continue to develop normal commercial and economic relations with Cuba , based on common interest and mutual benefit and implemented in strict accordance with our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and generally recognized principles and norms of international law , without any discrimination or jeopardy to the legal rights and interests of the parties .  
In Syria we look forward to a Middle East region where a just , lasting and comprehensive peace prevails , a peace based on international legality , not on expansion , occupation and the monopoly of nuclear military power , which can only lead to increased tension in the Middle East .  
Despite the result of the referendum last May , it is of the utmost importance that the peace agreements be fully implemented , especially with regard to full respect for human rights , equal opportunities for the indigenous population , reform of the judicial system , fiscal and land reform , and reconciliation based on truth .  
For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
In view of the recent dramatic collapse of many regional fisheries and the deterioration of many economies based on fisheries , we are concerned about illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing also called IUU fishing especially by vessels which are not members of regional fisheries organizations or arrangements or by reflagged vessels owned by nationals of Member States .  
The current economic world situation is a cause for great concern for developing countries , and it is vital to seek and to foster new forms of international economic cooperation based on a partnership with reciprocal gains for all the participants .  
More immediately , in this prestigious forum of the United Nations , the dynamic and dialogue of peace must allow us , Palestinians and Israelis , to free ourselves from the doctrinaire shackles of preserving a mindless ritual : that of periodically pillorying Israel through the persistence of certain obsolete resolutions that refuse to disappear , pillorying by United Nations opprobrium based on a majority follow the leader attitude that rarely changes .  
My country reaffirms its principled position that just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East must be based , first and foremost , on the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , particularly their right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent State with Al-Quds as its capital .  
Such cooperation must continue to be based on key activities of the international community , first and foremost among which are promoting the prevention and settlement of conflicts , peacekeeping and ensuring the humanitarian aspects of security and development , including respect for human rights and the rights of national minorities , refugees and displaced persons . 
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly has helped move the debate forward by recognizing that good governance is governance that is responsible to the needs of the people , based on efficient , participatory , transparent and accountable public service , policy-making processes and administration .  
Recognizing further that the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be based on a thorough safety assessment , including probabilistic risk analysis , with particular emphasis on reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the public to harmful radiation or radioactive material ,  
And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .  
Cairo + 5 is part of a series of international conferences that constitute fundamental elements for the advancement and improvement of the situation of mankind , and particularly that of women , who in many instances suffer major discrimination based on their gender and on historic , social and cultural beliefs that undermine their possibilities to advance and their basic right to occupy their due place in all aspects of social life on an equal footing with men .  
However we address the issues , emphasizing the economic , social and cultural aspects of population and development as integrated into various sectors , my Government strongly believes that the Programme of Action can be achieved only if we can accept the standard rules and procedures in principle but are able , when it comes to the implementation of programmes and activities , to be flexible to allow for adjustments based on every country ' s specific needs .  
We set ourselves both quantitative and qualitative goals and accepted that their achievement would not only require the commitment and actions of individual nations , but would also pivot on a new global partnership among all the world ' s countries and peoples , based on a sense of shared but differentiated responsibility for each other and for our planetary home .  
Some delegations stated that cleaner production and eco-efficiency , based on improved skills , technologies and efficient use of energy and resources , were essential to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
Data based on a number of indicators of the gender gap for different regions show that , for developing countries as a whole , the adult literacy rate is 16 percentage points higher for men than for women ; female school enrolment even at the primary level is 13 per cent lower than the level for males ; and womens share of earned income is a third of the total .  
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
Also bearing in mind that democracy , development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives ,  
However , much had already been done ( including the review of measures taken to promote gender equality , the establishment of a national centre to combat ethnic discrimination , the development of a national plan of action for disabled persons ) , and Norways labour legislation had recently been amended to make discrimination based on race , colour , nationality , ethnic origin or sexual preference , in the area of employment , a criminal offence .  
The strategy is based on a ) a determined policy to improve the exploitation of water resources ; b ) strengthening of the national facilities for research on agriculture in arid areas ; c ) a consistent and sound policy for achieving reliable food supplies ; and d ) an overall approach that displays lasting consistency towards the economic operators ( farmers , stockbreeders , processing concerns , etc . ) , which can be affected by many types of hazard .  
With these understandings , the process of substantive talks provided for in the Itamaraty Declaration of Peace of 17 February 1995 has been completed and a comprehensive and lasting end has been put to the differences between the two republics , so that , on the basis of their common roots , the two nations can advance towards a promising future based on cooperation and mutual benefit .  
National decisions and the capacity to manage land resources sustainably can also be constrained by external factors and the impacts of inappropriate development strategies pursued in the past , including unequal negotiations for rights to exploit natural resources by national and foreign companies , and poorly designed projects financed by donors which have been based on purely economic considerations .  
Under the Commissions work programme on indicators for sustainable development and work programme on changing consumption and production patterns , a preliminary core set of indicators have been developed for consumption and production patterns , based on an expert group meeting held at the United Nations in March 1998 .  
These companies are developing their offers more and more aggressively , putting forward arguments for legitimacy based on military efficiency , cheaper operations , their personnel ' s proven experience and an alleged comparative advantage that would make it feasible or desirable to hire them for peace _ building or peacekeeping operations such as those conducted by the United Nations or ECOWAS .  
Therefore , the public sector can play a catalytic role by helping to promote stable and profitable housing finance systems , the introduction of new products that satisfactorily meet demand , the introduction and adoption of banking regulations and , most of all , by promoting a housing policy model that takes the long-term view and that is based on a partnership between the public and private sectors .  
In recognition of the fact that they are based on existing human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , the workshop affirmed that the Guiding Principles do not seek to create a privileged category of persons or to establish a separate legal status for the internally displaced .  
However , there are problems of protecting the individual in the event of biomedical experimentation , especially to ensure respect for the integrity of persons participating in such research and their free and informed consent based on an assessment of the risks involved , in order to avoid any untoward incident or undesirable effect .  
The additional requirement of $ 1 , 991 , 900 under this heading resulted primarily from paying an unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective on 1 March 1997 and the delayed termination separation of individual local contractors under special service agreements and local staff hired as general temporary assistance based on their actual contract expiration dates , which were mostly in July or August of 1997 , rather than 30 June 1997 .  
An initial , simple mathematical model , based on a system of just two differential equations , proved suitable to illustrate the mechanism that can ultimately lead to a chain reaction of orbiting debris .  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Convinced that moving towards a society for all ages will require policies that strengthen individual lifelong development into late life , focusing on self-help and independence , and , relatedly and simultaneously , strengthen enabling environments of families , neighbourhoods , communities of interest and broad societal institutions based on principles of reciprocity and interdependence ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a report on the status of the additional Protocols , as well as measures taken to strengthen the existing body of international humanitarian law , inter alia , with respect to its dissemination and full implementation at the national level , based on information received from Member States and the International Committee of the Red Cross ;  
The observer for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference reiterated support for the draft declaration in its current form which , if adopted , would guarantee the political , social , economic and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and lead to a path of peace based on mutual respect .  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
On the other hand , such a treaty must be internationally and effectively verifiable , which means that the international instrument to be negotiated should be based on absolute transparency , which implies that all facilities anywhere in the world that are involved in the process of the production or storage of fissile material must be subject to a strict regime of control and inspection .  
Thus , since 1995 , INDAP has explicitly mainstreamed a gender perspective in its regular institutional activities , meaning that a cross-cutting approach will be taken to each of its activities and measures , based on the recognition of rural families as a basic unit of the production process , with different requirements according to their composition and specific members ( men , women , young people , older persons , relatives , etc . ) .

Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
It is saddening that at the dawn of the twenty-first century and the strides that humanity has made in constructing a new international environment , where respect for international law and legality and full protection of human rights constitute the cornerstone of the policy of States , the Turkish Republic continues to behave in a manner reminiscent of some of the worst periods of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries , with an anachronistic approach in its relations with its neighbours based on threats and the use of force . 
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
Express our conviction that political platforms based on racism , xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and discrimination must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance , and that racial discrimination condoned by governmental policies violates human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples , cooperation among nations , and international peace and security ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
This phenomenon of multiple job-holding is considered to be on the increase based on the observation of a local pollster , who points out that an increasing number of Jamaicans are being forced into additional employment on a part-time basis as a measure to counter the rising cost of living .  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
The present report is based on the replies from 12 governmental agencies which were received by mid April 2001.1 A shorter version of the questionnaire was transmitted to relevant international organizations , specialized agencies and cooperative organizations ; 21 responses were received . 2 Respondents provided information on the action taken in the following areas : 
The objective of the present guidelines is to provide advice to Governments and set out broad principles on which national cooperative policy might best be based , recognizing that more specific and detailed national policies fall within the responsibility of each Government .  
When the States adhered to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in 1996 , they pledged to respect and guarantee to all individuals living in their territory , and who are under their jurisdiction , the rights recognized by the Covenant with no discrimination based on race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , social status , birth , or any other criteria .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
His delegation understood that the Secretariat intended to submit a revised budget estimate based on the priorities for the coming months , as identified by the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General , and on the timing and budgetary implications of the forthcoming Kosovo-wide elections .  
While the fixed-fee approach reflected in the Regulations governing polymetallic nodules acts as an incentive to claim the maximum permissible area , a variable fee , based on the size of the area , would operate as an incentive to keep claims as small as possible and would discourage speculative ventures .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Convinced of the fundamental importance of universal accession or ratification to and full implementation of [ the / our ] obligations arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instrument to eliminate racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance [ based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin ] ,  
PP8bis Reaffirming our commitment to combating all manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance on grounds of [ race , lineage , colour , religion , culture , language or national or ethnic origin * ] [ aggravated by forms of multiple discrimination based on reasons of age , gender , [ sexual orientation ] , physical and mental ability disability , or socio-economic status * ] ,  
The Commission also called for the condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination , and for concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields , through improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services , in order to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights for all women and girls .  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The challenge of building functioning institutions safeguarding fundamental human rights and capable of supporting a multi-ethnic society based on democratic principles and tolerance is a major one .  
To contribute to the search for a common denominator based on the peace agreements that would win the support of broad sectors of the population , MINUGUA , at the request of the parties , held an extensive round of consultations through which it discovered that there was some readiness on the part of sectors of society to work together on specific issues .  
The process used to determine such a rate must be transparent and based on clear , empirical data , since any ad hoc figure that was calculated in an irrational or obscure manner and not grounded in solid , empirical data might result in inconsistent results .  
Takes note of the views of the Secretariat regarding the possibility of reviewing , subject to future experience , the procedures for settlement of liability for damages for major equipment used by one country and owned by another country , and decides that the liability for damage to major equipment used by one country and owned by another should be based on the relevant provisions of their memoranda of understanding in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the United Nations ;  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
The new democratic Governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the Republic of Croatia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have each pledged , and begun to act upon , commitments to constructive bilateral and regional relations based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
This dire prognosis is based on the analysis of the current epidemiological situation in Georgia and neighbouring countries , all of which are experiencing widespread drug abuse , increased migration , and lack of disposable medical instruments and diagnostic test systems , among other factors .  Currently , Georgia is still within the so-called window of opportunity for preventing the massive spread of HIV / AIDS .  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
[ 10 ] After considering information in States parties reports concerning the ways in which individuals are identified as being members of a particular racial or ethnic group , the Committee stated that such identification should , if no justification existed to the contrary , be based upon self-identification by the individual concerned . 
The simple fact that a particular category of the population suffers from underprivileged economic or social conditions does not mean that , in order to upgrade its material position , any distinction based on a characteristic defining the group should be considered legitimate , even if the ground is irrelevant as a basis of distinction with regard to a particular right .  
Thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable ;  
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
Urges States to take concrete measures to promote equality based on the elimination of gender and racial prejudice in all fields through , inter alia , improving access to education , health care , employment and other basic services to promote full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
In this regard , it is important to introduce and , as applicable , to reinforce an / the anti-discrimination and anti-racism components / into human rights programmes in school curricula , to develop relevant educational material and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns , etc .  / of the school curricula and to improve educational materials on human rights and anti-racism , in order to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination , mutual respect and tolerance ;  
Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .  
The fact that General Assembly resolution 55 / 5 stated that the reduction of the maximum assessment rate should have no automatic implication for the specialized agencies merely confirmed that the latter enjoyed financial autonomy and that , in the case of UNIDO , the resolution did not prevail over the relevant provisions of the UNIDO Constitution , which in Article 15.2 stated that the scale of assessments should be based to the extent possible on the scale most recently employed by the United Nations .  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Urges States to continue to support research in the area of human genetics and biotechnology , subject to accepted scientific and ethical standards and to the potential benefit of all , especially the poor , emphasizing that such research and its applications should fully respect human dignity , freedom and human rights , as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics ;  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the supreme chief of the Taliban , asking him not to issue the decree because of its discriminatory nature and stressing that measures designed to protect minorities must be consistent with the relevant international human rights standards , which were based on the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of religion or belief .  
In its resolution 54 / 135 of 17 December 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant international organizations , specialized agencies , funds and programmes , and in consultation with Member States , to prepare a comprehensive report on the situation of rural women and challenges faced by them , based , inter alia , on the outcome of an expert group meeting , which would draw from the contributions and case studies provided by experts from various regions and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-sixth session .  
The Commission had placed emphasis on raising the value of traditional knowledge , on promoting sustainable use of genetic resources , and on ensuring equitable benefit sharing in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based products , and it had recommended that the international community explore minimum standards for an internationally recognized sui generis system . 
Djibouti has a dual economy , characterized by an important informal sector that serves a population with weak purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , which serves a population with strong purchasing power that depends almost entirely on imports .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
He further requested that the Working Group pay attention to and report on the emerging standards based on precedent and existing legal instruments by which indigenous peoples and nations were seeking justice and reparations for the past and present abuses of mining and other corporations , including in the home countries of transnational corporations .  
While the United Front has recently stated its commitment to a negotiated political settlement based on the right of the Afghan people to self-determination , a position supported by those Afghans supporting the convening of an emergency loya jirga , the Taliban remain of the view that the selection by ulemas of Mullah Mohammad Omar as Amir-ul Momenin with lifelong untrammelled powers has already adequately expressed the wishes of the Afghan people .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
I am convinced that a political solution based on the twin pillars of enabling the Afghan people to freely determine their own future and securing the legitimate national interests of Afghanistans neighbours through mutually binding commitments offers the best guarantee for a lasting peace in Afghanistan .  
This resolution , however , representing as it does a dangerous precedent in which the Security Council gives unlimited authorization to States cooperating with the Government of Kuwait to interfere with civilian trade , is not based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and does not therefore make it permissible to use coercive military measures for its enforcement .  
My country felt that it itself had been struck to its foundations , as did all States whose institutions rest on democratic principles , respect for the human person and the rule of law , values upon which our societies are based , as is the international community gathered at the United Nations . Its commitment to defending those values is therefore absolute .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
Our call for general and complete disarmament is based on our firm conviction that there is no alternative to disarmament , the only choice that will definitively free humanity from the threat of its extinction , guarantee peace and security in the world and release resources allocated to weapons for economic and social development .  
Following these positive changes of the last few years that have strengthened the need for a renewed strategic vision of peace and stability throughout the world , it is necessary that international security be separated from military factors and go beyond security concepts based on nuclear weapons .  
The commitment expressed by my country to the process of construction of the Euro-Mediterranean space , undertaken six years ago , is based strongly on its deep conviction that only joint and concerted action can consolidate stability and security in this region , and from that , to lay down , within the framework of a global approach , the basis of solidarity and cooperation based on the community of interests and a mutually advantageous partnership .  
Recognizing the importance , from an analytical and operational point of view , of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding ,  
In Southern and East Africa , for example , the benefits from harmonized axle load limits are as follows : ( i ) transport operators are able to load their trucks with the maximum payload ; ( ii ) harmonized axle load limits facilitate uniform axle load enforcement ; ( iii ) these limits also facilitate exchange of information on overloading and on habitual violators of axle load limits ; and ( iv ) there is uniform application of fines for overloading and excessive gross vehicle weights , based on an agreed pavement damage formula .  
The situation of military detentions by KFOR is based on rather more obscure legal grounds . 9 The Special Representative is informed that KFOR routinely arrests and detains individuals on an extrajudicial basis , mostly ethnic Albanians suspected of fighting in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia , citing resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and customary international law as the legal sources of KFOR authority for detentions . 
He rejected the proposals of the Secretary-General of the United Nations of 1985 and 1986 , based on partnership , and when he lost the elections in 1988 he publicly declared that he had never believed in a federal settlement and that he had done his national duty by protecting the title of the government of Cyprus ( which was the nearest point to Enosis , as stated by Makarios ) . 
One panellist considered that the success of European monetary integration had been favoured by the close trade ties among the countries involved and had been based on a unique and historically motivated political commitment by EU member States , which so far was still lacking in Asia , for example , and which in general was difficult to replicate elsewhere .  
Through the New African Initiative , African leaders have drawn a road map for a new relationship between Africa and its development partners based on guiding principles which include a focus on African ownership of development goals , objectives and policies ; the mutual responsibility of African countries and their development partners for achieving shared objectives ; the provision of long-term donor support , taking into account the diversity that exists within and among African countries ; and a bold and comprehensive plan for Africa 's irreversible emergence from its current fragile state .  
The majority of those in academic circles who dealt with the issue of terrorism shared the opinion that terrorism meant the following : the use of or threat to use violence for political purposes ; a method of fighting or reaching specific goals based on intimidation of a society and government by causing human casualties and loss of property , characterized by ruthlessness and violation of moral and legal norms .  
His Government would be giving top priority in the coming four years to creating an information society based on science and new technologies , by , inter alia , introducing computer education for students , teachers and civil servants , and using computer networks to centralize access to government services ; developing a long-term science and technology strategy ; promoting electronic business ; and using an integrated communications network to fight organized crime , drug-dealing and illegal immigration .  
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
In the social sphere , bridges should be built not only to improve education and train people to live together in a highly competitive world , but to ensure peaceful coexistence based on tolerance , respect and solidarity , as well as strengthening national and international institutions to ensure the changes needed for new commitments .  
The present report therefore focuses on actual cash inflows as at 30 September 2001 , as well as cash payments expected during the last quarter of this year based on information received from Member States and on prior payment patterns , both in the aggregate and by category that is , the regular budget , peacekeeping and the international tribunals .  
Our objective observation of these approaches and situations which can under no circumstances be dealt with separately from an understanding of the common framework of their causes and motives prompts us to call upon the international community to set a binding international strategy for security cooperation among all States , whose components are based on the principles of international law , the Charter , resolutions , agreements , conventions and protocols of the United Nations that do not discriminate between States and peoples .  
A worldwide campaign of solidarity was needed to meet all those growing challenges with a view to strengthening international cooperation and transparency based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and of international law , namely , equality among States , non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , the right of peoples to self-defence , to self-determination and to oppose foreign occupation , and respect for cultural diversity and diversity of beliefs .  
He hoped that the Committees discussions at the current session would help to promote the role of the United Nations in designing and coordinating development policies and programmes in developing countries and to revitalize an approach to international development and social cooperation that was based on equality among peoples and the right of States to choose their own development course and achieve a better future for their societies in accordance with their independent national policies and interests .  
Its commitment included the adoption of firm and coordinated measures to achieve economic and social development based on decent employment , sound education and comprehensive health services for the most needy sectors .  
By imposing the duty to criminalize prohibited acts and undertake prompt , adequate judicial action under the prosecute or extradite principle , the Convention had filled the gap between the Geneva Conventions and the standard of treatment based on the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and related instruments .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
The source stressed in conclusion the position of the State of Qatar and the States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in support of the Palestinian people in its just struggle to regain its legitimate rights , in accordance with the resolutions based on international legitimacy , the foremost of which is the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on its national soil with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital .  
In the Declaration , ministers and representatives of new or restored democracies reaffirmed that the power of public authorities must be based on the will of the people , expressed freely in periodic , fair , pluralistic elections , free of intimidation , conducted by universal , equal suffrage and secret balloting and under the supervision of an independent institution , and that public authorities must be accountable for their acts .  
These additional requirements were offset by savings under contractual security services at Kigali based on a need for fewer security officers than anticipated ( $ 3,700 ) ; the periodic reduction in the use of Tanzanian Police Officers , who were recalled to municipal duties ( $ 72,400 ) ; the lower than expected cost of vehicle insurance ( $ 6,000 ) ; and cleaning and laundry services that cost less than anticipated ( $ 25,700 ) .  
Recognizing that the risk of impoverishment , particularly in old age , is greater for women because social security schemes are based on a history of continuous remunerated employment and older women have often spent their lives in unremunerated caregiving or in informal labour activity , and that in this regard women have also faced lifelong discrimination in respect of entering and functioning in the formal labour market ,  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .  
It had applied a model unique of its kind based on a number of common policies with regard to asylum and migration providing , inter alia , for criteria for the granting of refugee status , minimum standards regarding reception , minimum standards regarding the status of long-term residents from third countries , and the establishment of analytical and descriptive statistics by the Statistical Office of the European Communities ( EUROSTAT ) .  
Informal processes may take various forms , ranging from a completely informal process based upon non-binding principles which support a collective negotiating framework and do not involve the judicial system ( although relying on the existence of an efficient and effective formal system for leverage ) , to those which utilize a judicial administration mechanism to enforce a plan reached by informal negotiations and to bind creditors to that plan .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
The events of 11 September and the angry or opportunistic reactions that followed them , including the brutal aggression against Afghanistan based on a suspicion and the accompanying innuendos and statements emanating from the media or from officials , both American and non-American , have shown that the entire world could be set ablaze by a spark from the West , even one coming from beyond the Atlantic .  
Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Reaffirming that democracy , development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are mutually supportive concepts : democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic , social and cultural regime and their full participation in all aspects of life . 
The introduction of the staff member pay control mechanisms based on automatic updates of staff member entitlements proved to be more complex than had been foreseen and required extensive monitoring , troubleshooting , analysis and prompt resolution of critical problems .  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
In carrying out his mandate , the independent expert must respect a set of basic principles to be embodied in the resolution requesting his appointment , including international cooperation based on Article 2 of the United Nations Charter , the condemnation of unilateral actions , respect for the key role of States in action to combat impunity and the obligation to determine the responsibility of the perpetrators of human rights violations as an essential component of effective compensation and international cooperation through universally applicable mechanisms . 
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the Strategy , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
To call for steps to be taken at the Summit to be held in Johannesburg to foster the establishment of effective means of facilitating technology transfer and new approaches to production under more favourable conditions , in keeping with principle 9 of the Rio Declaration , based , in particular , on the establishment by developed countries of financial mechanisms and preferential forms of tax treatment .  
To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
A crucial role in the global governance of sustainable development that has found widespread acceptance since the 1992 Rio Conference has been played by the instrument of authoritative statements based on scientific assessments .  
Along this intellectual journey , astronomy has been instrumental in shaping modern empirical science , based on reproducible measurements and verifiable physical laws .  
A number of projects ( Ionosphere-1 , Ionosphere-2 , Ionosphere Variant ) are devoted to designing facilities and software for the investigation of acoustic communications channels in lithospheric-ionospheric systems in the infrasound range , to conducting experiments to investigate acoustic and electromagnetic effects in the atmosphere and ionosphere , to taking terrestrial measurements of electromagnetic signals and echoes caused by acoustic disturbances in the atmosphere , and to assessing the potential for seismographic forecasting based on these signals .  10 .  An international project entitled Warnings focuses on the elaboration of a common scientific programme of experiments .  
A second stakeholder issue is that although the statistical indicators that are derived from United Nations conferences and summits are motivated by international needs , they are based on policy issues that must be reflected in the national policy agenda if the desired progress is to be achieved . 
That measure could be based on the level of regular statistical activity within a country , an ongoing critical mass of survey-taking and statistical analysis , and the existence of basic elements of statistical infrastructure .  
He had called for a new solidarity based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility , in other words allowing for an adequate apportionment of the burden , bearing in mind the special responsibility of some countries which historically had accounted for a large portion of global resource use to ensure that the developing countries had the means for sustainable development .
