Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .

Such perverse acts have led to Taiwan 's turbulent political situation , sluggish economy , tumbling stock prices , and unstable popular feelings .  As a result , not only is the political deadlock between the two sides of the strait unable to be broken , but some factors of uncertainty keeps on increasing .  
Through the implementation of the party 's rural policies and in-depth reforms , we should effectively protect , arouse , and give play to the initiative of the peasants .  This is the main driving force for increasing their income .  At the same time , the advantageous technological and intelligent conditions in the capital should be brought into full play ;

Besides , the " digital gap " resulted from the rapid development of the modern information technology is further increasing the gap between the developing countries and the developed ones in terms of the level of income and the level of development .  Some developing countries are being pushed farther to the brink [ bi jin yi bu bian yuan hua ] .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .

In recent years , thanks to the sustained boom of the US economy , the pay in nonmilitary sectors has been increasing rather fast and the appeal of the armed forces has diminished .

At this historical juncture , in using its social resources and in its industrial restructuring , Hong Kong must put greater stress on cost-effectiveness and on increasing its value-adding ability .

After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .  But in the end , because of the restrictions imposed by the social and political environment at that time , the opposite result was the outcome , with the base for future taxes actually increasing , and the farmers ' burden was heavier .  
In particular , we must regard increasing the peasants ' income as the focus of agricultural and rural work , as the main task to tackle in developing the rural economy , and as an important yardstick to measure the results of the " three represents " [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] study and education activities in rural areas .  
In conducting such activities , we must have our eyes on improving the overall quality of the broad masses of rural grass-roots cadres , on solving existing conspicuous problems in rural areas , and on safeguarding and increasing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of peasants .  Such study and education must be closely linked with promoting rural work .

In this year 's report , " arable land should be effectively protected " is the second sentence at the beginning of a related paragraph .  It has become the prerequisite of " structural adjustment . "  The report has also stressed that the center of adjustment should be " improving the strains of crops , raising quality and increasing efficiency " while " stabilizing the production of grains .

Just as the halls of government were reverberating with heated debate about the shortage of water , on May 8 Taiwan Power , as a result of the drought and increasing demand from the rebounding economy , began rationing power without prior warning . This decision has had an impact on more than 2,000 industrial users . Kuo Jan-tai , a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University , points out that because the water reservoirs in Taiwan are naturally unreliable storehouses of water , dams usually generate only one-tenth of Taiwan 's electricity supply .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .

the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
Supreme Council took note of the steps taken for the implementation of its decision at its fifteenth session concerning the development of economic cooperation within the framework of implementation of the Economic Agreement and approved the recommendations of the Committee on Financial and Economic Cooperation concerning the development of banking in Council States and increasing its competitivity at the regional and international levels , which would , in principle , permit national banks to open branches in Council States and effect a linkage between national automated banking networks in Council States . 
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Committee noted with regret that the economic constraints resulting from the transition process were having a negative impact on women 's employment and health ; female unemployment was increasing and the quality of social services provided to women was deteriorating .  NULLIn addition , the state of health of the female population was unsatisfactory when judged by international standards .  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
A number of societies are seriously threatened by increasing external debt , the instability of the international financial system , persistent unemployment , intractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of crime and corruption .  
We draw the attention of the international community to the precarious situation in the region , the consequences of continued failure and the increasing possibilities of confrontation , which make it necessary for the international community to be vigilant , dynamic and strict in implementing justice and the rule of law so as to save the region from the potential scourge of war .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
The review recognized that , while some encouraging progress has been made in social and economic development , in increasing democratization , in regional integration and in conflict prevention , management and resolution at the regional level , this progress has been uneven , and much remains to be done , as has been outlined , inter alia , in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit ( A / 50 / 885 ) .  
It faces daunting problems , including civil strife , a large foreign debt , increasing populations dependent on decreasing amounts of usable land , and an inadequate flow of investment .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
The overwhelming burden of external debt , excessive dependence on a few commodities , rapid population growth , serious deterioration of nutritional indicators , environmental degradation with the recurring problems of drought and desertification social tensions and ongoing conflicts reveal only part of the grave consequences of increasing marginalization of African countries from the world economy .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
Electricity has increasingly assumed greater importance in the total energy mix of developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as being central to economic and social development .  
Although adolescent fertility is increasingly perceived as an issue of social and policy concern , fertility rates among women under age 20 have been falling alongside overall fertility rates world wide , owing to rising age at marriage , increasing educational opportunities for young women and increased use of contraception .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .

The new ARIANE-5 launcher has a dual purpose : first , to make the ARIANE family more competitive by enhancing performance levels , reducing launch costs , improving reliability and increasing the useful diameter under the fairing , so that ARIANE-5 will be capable of launching into geostationary transfer orbit either two-3,000 kilogram satellites simultaneously or a single satellite of up to 6,800 kilograms ; second , to satisfy Europe 's need for a low-orbit facility using manned vehicles or space station sections .  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The development of modern planned forestry practices in Western Europe can be traced to the late 1700s , a time of rapid population growth , expanding urbanization , explosive scientific discovery and increasing confidence in mankind 's ability to master nature .  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
This has been accompanied by increasing concern for the environment , and notable improvements in specific fuel consumption , primarily driven by economic considerations , resulting in lower emissions of CO2 ( currently estimated at 3 per cent of the global total ) and particulates than would otherwise have occurred . 
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
Due to tight budgets in developed countries , developing countries and economies in transition , policy makers are showing increasing interest in saving on scarce budgetary resources by launching reviews of existing subsidy regimes .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
In order to maintain public finances on a sound footing while simultaneously meeting social commitments , the Government implemented tax reforms by widening the tax base ; increasing tax rates ; restructuring tax brackets to increase progressivity of personal income tax ; and by raising excise taxes to finance an increase in pensions and educational spending .  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
With the increasing relevance of competition policy in managing a competitive economy based on the private sector , a pressing need emerges for each country in the region to legislate viable laws governing the potential abuses of market power .  
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
Spanish legislation laid down very useful additional measures for cases in which the offences were committed by organized gangs , as well as increasing the penalty imposed , such as the dissolution of the organization , closure of its premises , temporary suspension of its activities and professional disqualification of its members .  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
Major areas for policy , programme and project intervention will include nutrition ; the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity ; comprehensive reproductive health , including fertility regulation and sexual health , maternal health and safe motherhood , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS ; violence against women and girls as a public health issue ; female genital mutilation ; occupational health ; and increasing the use of gender-based indicators and of national legislation to promote women 's health .  
ACC members shared the position expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , cited in paragraph 1 above . a / The General Assembly in paragraph 42 of resolution 47 / 199 , recognized the cost factor and indicated that common premises and the consolidation of administrative infrastructures should be achieved without increasing the costs for the United Nations system or for developing countries .  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
The meeting was convened to pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services over an ambitious but realistic time period , by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in strengthening their capacity for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , human resources development and public administration training ; improving performance in the public sector ; increasing public / private sector interaction ; managing development programmes ; and enhancing government legal capacity ;  
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
As is strongly reaffirmed in paragraph 5 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 , the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 50 / 120 .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
ECLAC studies in international trade , transportation and the financing of development focused on the design of policies and mechanisms to foster the continued expansion and improvement of the commercial linkages of Latin America and the Caribbean with the changing world economy , particularly in view of the current trends towards globalization in production and increasing liberalization of trade and finance .  
These long-term trends characterizing natality and the rate of marriages result in the following consequences : accelerated exchange of generations ; juvenation of grandparenthood ; gradual stabilization of the two-child model ; reduction of sibling relations and closing of sibling ages ; reduction in the number of family-nucleus members ; and horizontal narrowing and vertical broadening of families ( increasing the number of generations to include great-grandparents ) .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
The general population 's lack of income-earning opportunities and low purchasing power , combined with increasing prices and decreased availability of basic goods on local markets , have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
The meeting was convened to express a mutual commitment and pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery . 
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
Towards that end , they resolved seriously to consider fresh policy options in order to give proper effect to the segments of the Final Declaration of the Fourth Conference , held at Pyongyang , dealing with South-South cooperation as a key element in increasing information capabilities at the national , regional and global levels .  
The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .  
Since the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 49 / 108 , UNIDO has advanced a major process of programmatic and managerial reform , responding to changed industrial realities and support requirements both by a substantive reformulation of its priorities and focus and by internal reforms in management and organizational structure with a view to increasing effectiveness , efficiency and impact .  
Changes and modifications proposed in the existing mechanism , such as , creating multiple claims review boards , increasing their financial authority and provision of additional experienced staff at the field and Headquarters levels , are designed to address the practical difficulties encountered .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
In respect of international cooperation and practical technical assistance , the Governments were making efforts to strengthen the rule of law through international cooperation and assistance , improving policy development , increasing the use of bilateral and multilateral agreements and promoting the establishment of integrated regional policies , programmes , plans and mechanisms to prevent crime and ensure justice .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money-laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,

The World Summit for Social Development organized two years ago in a post-cold-war international environment characterized by profound social , economic and political changes and increasing globalization represented a milestone in the history of international cooperation .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
Convinced that economic growth can be achieved only if accompanied by increasing levels of sustainable development , the Central American countries wish to inform the international community of our decision to move forward resolutely towards a common future , a future of great progress and solidarity for our peoples .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
While the proportion of people in absolute poverty may have been reduced as a result of rapid economic growth in some very large low-income developing countries ( notably China and India ) , the process of globalization has been accompanied by an increasing economic gap between the high and middle-income countries and the least developed countries . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
The rapid ageing of societies in Asia and the Pacific , accompanied by the increasing proportion and absolute number of older persons in the population , has triggered concern for older persons in the region , while the economic and social impact of the ageing of populations poses a growing challenge to societies throughout the region .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
The harsh economic climate in the period since UNCED has meant that available professional and monetary resources have actually decreased drastically over the period , rather than increasing to reflect the extra efforts implicit in the follow-up to the Conference .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
Finally , while FDI has contributed positively to the economic stability of many developing countries , the increasing importance of international portfolio investment has raised concern about the possible negative effects that such volatile investment could have for the stability of developing economies that are exposed to such flows .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
Fund-raising and promotional efforts directed towards increasing funding opportunities resulted in several project-specific donations and , thanks to the continuous support of Italy , the host country , the overall financial situation of UNICRI stabilized at a somewhat more viable level , although demands for assistance and services are still greater than the capacity of UNICRI to provide timely and adequate responses to them . 
On behalf of the Society for the Reform of Criminal Law , the Centre was responsible for the organization of an international conference on the theme " Challenges to criminal justice in a changing world " , which took place at Whistler , British Columbia , from 21 to 24 August 1996 , and examined the challenges posed by increasing opportunities in organized economic crime .  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
Many Governments indicated an urgent need to provide specific training for law enforcement officials on relevant issues , with a view to increasing the effectiveness of border controls , upgrading skills in identifying motor vehicles with false documents or altered security features and improving the reliability of document controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Given the increasing number of decision-making bodies concerned with the various aspects of sustainable development , including international conventions , there is an ever greater need for better policy coordination at the intergovernmental level to ensure consistent and coherent positions of Governments in such processes , as well as enhanced collaboration among their secretariats . 
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
The increasing number of the fabricated and unjustified blocks and holds it puts on and the objections it makes to many of the contracts submitted to the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , particularly in recent times , have demonstrated that the United States administration is using that Committee as a tool to implement its irresponsible policy directed against Iraq , by , whenever it wishes , preventing the Committee from approving contracts for food and medical supplies .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
The paper is divided into four main sections , which deal respectively with increasing opportunities in the private sector , the business-enabling environment , promotion of competition and social regulation , and a final section which briefly touches on the role of the international community with regard to the foregoing .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as the provision of credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
Among the recommendations made in the report were an emphasis on the importance of increasing economic growth rates in order to increase the rate of employment growth , and a recognition that this would require political and social as well as macroeconomic stability ; the importance of moderating the excesses of structural adjustment strategies ; an acknowledgement that for certain countries , a more gradual and selective approach to trade liberalization may be warranted ( ibid . , para . 25 ) ; and the value of policy incentives to offset market failure .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign-portfolio-equity investment flows .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .  At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
Although no reliable data exist on the prevalence of drug abuse in Afghanistan , anecdotal evidence suggests that it has increased during recent years , which may be explained as a consequence of the hard living conditions caused by a prolonged war , combined with the increasing availability of both opium and heroin .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
At the domestic level , we must promote higher standards of national government by strengthening our regulatory and supervisory frameworks , improving corporate governance , increasing transparency and lessening government interference in market decisions .  
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
Although foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have been increasing , the opposite has been the case with Africa , where even the little that has been directed to the continent has been decreasing over the years .  
Our interdependence is increasing through international legally binding commitments , the adoption of policies reaching across national borders , enhanced trade and financial flows , and markets which have become fully integrated on a global scale .  
The increasing spread of the social effects of economic phenomena , coupled with the rapid advances in technology , has made the coordination of economic policies at the international level more significant than ever before .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .  
Despite the progress achieved , the increasing tragedies and the escalation of massive and systematic violations are brutal reminders of the ease and frequency with which the noble ideal of defending human rights can be compromised .  
Among the complex tasks of reviving the economy there is one solid priority : the formation of a national market and a continuously growing solvent internal consumer demand with an increasing share in the production structure .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
The speaker explained that there was an increased level of business risk flowing from increasing levels of environmental legislation and growing public interest in corporate compliance .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
The Government has launched a major programme of reforming the public sector aimed at improving the capacity for efficient service delivery , devolving administrative power from the centre and increasing democratic participation in local government .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
He expressed the Communitys concern at the growth of transnational organized crime whose many facets and increasing sophistication threatened not only national and global security but also political stability and social and cultural values the world over .  
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
In a world marked by rapid change and increasing economic globalization , concerted action at the national and international levels was vital to renewed growth and development .  
Owing to the hard economic pressures created by the comprehensive embargo imposed on Iraq , large numbers of Iraqi women were forced to abandon working life by resigning or retiring from jobs because of fast increasing living costs and inadequate salaries .  
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
The reports of the experts are equally ominous .  A lack of safe drinking water for more than one third of the world 's population , continuing soil degradation , increasing global warming , unchecked urbanization , influxes of refugees , population growth and a failure to protect the fragile mountain ecosystem are some of the threatening signs .  
As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
Although the need to strengthen international economic cooperation based on the principles of international law and recognized norms had been reiterated in most intergovernmental fora , there was increasing recourse to unilateral coercive economic measures and the enactment of domestic laws with extraterritorial effects .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to a variety of global environmental systems , it is important to consider the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy demands for goods and other services .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
With the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance , those instruments provide a foundation for promoting and maintaining the rule of law , a basic requisite for sustainable socio-economic development ; furnish a basis for Governments to assess their systems , formulate legislation and develop effective tools for controlling national and transnational forms of crime ; and provide a framework for technical assistance , which in turn serves as a catalyst for their implementation .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
Reaffirming the important role of non-governmental organizations in the promotion of all human rights and in humanitarian activities at the national , regional and international levels , and appreciating their contribution to increasing public awareness of human rights issues , to the conduct of education , training and research in this field , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52 / 12 B ;  
The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .  
The Committee is particularly concerned with the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
The Ministry of Health and Social Care , along with the Association of Nurses , endeavours to achieve the objectives of the national programme on improving the status of women , in cooperation with the international organization for nurses , WHO and other United Nations specialized agencies , paying attention to increasing their role and responsibility in protecting the health of women and enhancing their professional knowledge and skills .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .  
In that context , apart from increasing its annual contribution to UNRWA , Cyprus had in 1996 developed its own scheme of assistance to the Palestinians which included , inter alia , the construction of two medical centres in the West Bank , at a cost of $ 2.2-million , and a comprehensive programme of technical assistance and training for some 100 Palestinian officials , including follow-up visits by Cypriot experts to the autonomous areas .  
Furthermore , the network of the Centre for Initiatives and Advancement for Women , as part of a project receiving financial support from the European Union , is promoting an improvement in the status of women by increasing their active participation in the countrys development and thus affording equal opportunities for women to contribute effectively to national economic , social , cultural and political processes , placing special emphasis on rural areas .  
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
It suggests that , globally , the absolute number of people living in poverty is still increasing ; that the number of people officially recorded as unemployed remains high ; that the number of underemployed people is enormous and growing ; and that social disintegration is intensifying in some countries .  
More contemporary national and international discussion of how to achieve a balanced approach to macroeconomic policy could be very valuable , focusing on how to simultaneously address economic and social goals , such as full employment , low inflation and development in the fullest sense , including both efficient economic growth and an effective strategy for increasing equity .  
New initiatives to meet the challenge of the informal sector could focus on increasing productivity through access to credit , basic infrastructure and social services , on a regulatory environment which is conducive to improving the quality of work without stifling the informal sectors employment creating capacity and on organizing informal sector employers and workers to defend their own interests .

Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .

Such perverse acts have led to Taiwan 's turbulent political situation , sluggish economy , tumbling stock prices , and unstable popular feelings .  As a result , not only is the political deadlock between the two sides of the strait unable to be broken , but some factors of uncertainty keeps on increasing .  
Through the implementation of the party 's rural policies and in-depth reforms , we should effectively protect , arouse , and give play to the initiative of the peasants .

Besides , the " digital gap " resulted from the rapid development of the modern information technology is further increasing the gap between the developing countries and the developed ones in terms of the level of income and the level of development .  Some developing countries are being pushed farther to the brink [ bi jin yi bu bian yuan hua ] .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .

In recent years , thanks to the sustained boom of the US economy , the pay in nonmilitary sectors has been increasing rather fast and the appeal of the armed forces has diminished .

After the implementation of these reform measures , there was for the most part a significant " clearing of the corruption " in a short period of time , so farmers had the opportunity to relax and generate profits .

Such study and education must be closely linked with promoting rural work .

At a meeting of ACC held the previous month in New York , all the Executive Heads of the organizations of the United Nations system had expressed deep awareness of the need for improved performance management and increased productivity at a time of increasing demands and scarce financial resources .  
the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
In its substantive programme actions , FAO continued to develop innovative interventions oriented towards increasing rural women 's access to and control of productive resources , especially through improved extension and training .  
Supreme Council took note of the steps taken for the implementation of its decision at its fifteenth session concerning the development of economic cooperation within the framework of implementation of the Economic Agreement and approved the recommendations of the Committee on Financial and Economic Cooperation concerning the development of banking in Council States and increasing its competitivity at the regional and international levels , which would , in principle , permit national banks to open branches in Council States and effect a linkage between national automated banking networks in Council States . 
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
The Committee noted with regret that the economic constraints resulting from the transition process were having a negative impact on women 's employment and health ; female unemployment was increasing and the quality of social services provided to women was deteriorating .  NULLIn addition , the state of health of the female population was unsatisfactory when judged by international standards .  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
A number of societies are seriously threatened by increasing external debt , the instability of the international financial system , persistent unemployment , intractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of crime and corruption .  
We draw the attention of the international community to the precarious situation in the region , the consequences of continued failure and the increasing possibilities of confrontation , which make it necessary for the international community to be vigilant , dynamic and strict in implementing justice and the rule of law so as to save the region from the potential scourge of war .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
The review recognized that , while some encouraging progress has been made in social and economic development , in increasing democratization , in regional integration and in conflict prevention , management and resolution at the regional level , this progress has been uneven , and much remains to be done , as has been outlined , inter alia , in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit ( A / 50 / 885 ) .  
It faces daunting problems , including civil strife , a large foreign debt , increasing populations dependent on decreasing amounts of usable land , and an inadequate flow of investment .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
The overwhelming burden of external debt , excessive dependence on a few commodities , rapid population growth , serious deterioration of nutritional indicators , environmental degradation with the recurring problems of drought and desertification social tensions and ongoing conflicts reveal only part of the grave consequences of increasing marginalization of African countries from the world economy .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
Electricity has increasingly assumed greater importance in the total energy mix of developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as being central to economic and social development .  
Although adolescent fertility is increasingly perceived as an issue of social and policy concern , fertility rates among women under age 20 have been falling alongside overall fertility rates world wide , owing to rising age at marriage , increasing educational opportunities for young women and increased use of contraception .  
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .

The new ARIANE-5 launcher has a dual purpose : first , to make the ARIANE family more competitive by enhancing performance levels , reducing launch costs , improving reliability and increasing the useful diameter under the fairing , so that ARIANE-5 will be capable of launching into geostationary transfer orbit either two-3,000 kilogram satellites simultaneously or a single satellite of up to 6,800 kilograms ; second , to satisfy Europe 's need for a low-orbit facility using manned vehicles or space station sections .  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burdens imposed by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
The development of modern planned forestry practices in Western Europe can be traced to the late 1700s , a time of rapid population growth , expanding urbanization , explosive scientific discovery and increasing confidence in mankind 's ability to master nature .  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
This has been accompanied by increasing concern for the environment , and notable improvements in specific fuel consumption , primarily driven by economic considerations , resulting in lower emissions of CO2 ( currently estimated at 3 per cent of the global total ) and particulates than would otherwise have occurred . 
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
Due to tight budgets in developed countries , developing countries and economies in transition , policy makers are showing increasing interest in saving on scarce budgetary resources by launching reviews of existing subsidy regimes .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
In order to maintain public finances on a sound footing while simultaneously meeting social commitments , the Government implemented tax reforms by widening the tax base ; increasing tax rates ; restructuring tax brackets to increase progressivity of personal income tax ; and by raising excise taxes to finance an increase in pensions and educational spending .  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
With the increasing relevance of competition policy in managing a competitive economy based on the private sector , a pressing need emerges for each country in the region to legislate viable laws governing the potential abuses of market power .  
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
Spanish legislation laid down very useful additional measures for cases in which the offences were committed by organized gangs , as well as increasing the penalty imposed , such as the dissolution of the organization , closure of its premises , temporary suspension of its activities and professional disqualification of its members .  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
Major areas for policy , programme and project intervention will include nutrition ; the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity ; comprehensive reproductive health , including fertility regulation and sexual health , maternal health and safe motherhood , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS ; violence against women and girls as a public health issue ; female genital mutilation ; occupational health ; and increasing the use of gender-based indicators and of national legislation to promote women 's health .  
ACC members shared the position expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , cited in paragraph 1 above . a / The General Assembly in paragraph 42 of resolution 47 / 199 , recognized the cost factor and indicated that common premises and the consolidation of administrative infrastructures should be achieved without increasing the costs for the United Nations system or for developing countries .  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
The meeting was convened to pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services over an ambitious but realistic time period , by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in strengthening their capacity for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , human resources development and public administration training ; improving performance in the public sector ; increasing public / private sector interaction ; managing development programmes ; and enhancing government legal capacity ;  
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
As is strongly reaffirmed in paragraph 5 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 , the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 50 / 120 .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .  
ECLAC studies in international trade , transportation and the financing of development focused on the design of policies and mechanisms to foster the continued expansion and improvement of the commercial linkages of Latin America and the Caribbean with the changing world economy , particularly in view of the current trends towards globalization in production and increasing liberalization of trade and finance .  
These long-term trends characterizing natality and the rate of marriages result in the following consequences : accelerated exchange of generations ; juvenation of grandparenthood ; gradual stabilization of the two-child model ; reduction of sibling relations and closing of sibling ages ; reduction in the number of family-nucleus members ; and horizontal narrowing and vertical broadening of families ( increasing the number of generations to include great-grandparents ) .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
The general population 's lack of income-earning opportunities and low purchasing power , combined with increasing prices and decreased availability of basic goods on local markets , have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
The meeting was convened to express a mutual commitment and pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery . 
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
Towards that end , they resolved seriously to consider fresh policy options in order to give proper effect to the segments of the Final Declaration of the Fourth Conference , held at Pyongyang , dealing with South-South cooperation as a key element in increasing information capabilities at the national , regional and global levels .  
The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .

An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
Yet while today it is the Congolese people who are hostages , perhaps tomorrow it will be another people 's turn to be taken hostage by a political class that is driven by selfish ambitions , unprepared to accept the rules of democracy and uninterested in seeking and maintaining peace .  Every day and at an increasing human cost , the excessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of others defer to a later date the establishment of conditions for a negotiated peace .  
The World Summit for Social Development organized two years ago in a post-cold-war international environment characterized by profound social , economic and political changes and increasing globalization represented a milestone in the history of international cooperation .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
Convinced that economic growth can be achieved only if accompanied by increasing levels of sustainable development , the Central American countries wish to inform the international community of our decision to move forward resolutely towards a common future , a future of great progress and solidarity for our peoples .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
While the proportion of people in absolute poverty may have been reduced as a result of rapid economic growth in some very large low-income developing countries ( notably China and India ) , the process of globalization has been accompanied by an increasing economic gap between the high and middle-income countries and the least developed countries . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
The rapid ageing of societies in Asia and the Pacific , accompanied by the increasing proportion and absolute number of older persons in the population , has triggered concern for older persons in the region , while the economic and social impact of the ageing of populations poses a growing challenge to societies throughout the region .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
The harsh economic climate in the period since UNCED has meant that available professional and monetary resources have actually decreased drastically over the period , rather than increasing to reflect the extra efforts implicit in the follow-up to the Conference .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
Finally , while FDI has contributed positively to the economic stability of many developing countries , the increasing importance of international portfolio investment has raised concern about the possible negative effects that such volatile investment could have for the stability of developing economies that are exposed to such flows .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
Fund-raising and promotional efforts directed towards increasing funding opportunities resulted in several project-specific donations and , thanks to the continuous support of Italy , the host country , the overall financial situation of UNICRI stabilized at a somewhat more viable level , although demands for assistance and services are still greater than the capacity of UNICRI to provide timely and adequate responses to them . 
On behalf of the Society for the Reform of Criminal Law , the Centre was responsible for the organization of an international conference on the theme " Challenges to criminal justice in a changing world " , which took place at Whistler , British Columbia , from 21 to 24 August 1996 , and examined the challenges posed by increasing opportunities in organized economic crime .  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
Many Governments indicated an urgent need to provide specific training for law enforcement officials on relevant issues , with a view to increasing the effectiveness of border controls , upgrading skills in identifying motor vehicles with false documents or altered security features and improving the reliability of document controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Given the increasing number of decision-making bodies concerned with the various aspects of sustainable development , including international conventions , there is an ever greater need for better policy coordination at the intergovernmental level to ensure consistent and coherent positions of Governments in such processes , as well as enhanced collaboration among their secretariats . 
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
The increasing number of the fabricated and unjustified blocks and holds it puts on and the objections it makes to many of the contracts submitted to the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , particularly in recent times , have demonstrated that the United States administration is using that Committee as a tool to implement its irresponsible policy directed against Iraq , by , whenever it wishes , preventing the Committee from approving contracts for food and medical supplies .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
The paper is divided into four main sections , which deal respectively with increasing opportunities in the private sector , the business-enabling environment , promotion of competition and social regulation , and a final section which briefly touches on the role of the international community with regard to the foregoing .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as the provision of credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
Among the recommendations made in the report were an emphasis on the importance of increasing economic growth rates in order to increase the rate of employment growth , and a recognition that this would require political and social as well as macroeconomic stability ; the importance of moderating the excesses of structural adjustment strategies ; an acknowledgement that for certain countries , a more gradual and selective approach to trade liberalization may be warranted ( ibid . , para . 25 ) ; and the value of policy incentives to offset market failure .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign-portfolio-equity investment flows .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .  At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
Although no reliable data exist on the prevalence of drug abuse in Afghanistan , anecdotal evidence suggests that it has increased during recent years , which may be explained as a consequence of the hard living conditions caused by a prolonged war , combined with the increasing availability of both opium and heroin .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
At the domestic level , we must promote higher standards of national government by strengthening our regulatory and supervisory frameworks , improving corporate governance , increasing transparency and lessening government interference in market decisions .  
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
Although foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have been increasing , the opposite has been the case with Africa , where even the little that has been directed to the continent has been decreasing over the years .  
Our interdependence is increasing through international legally binding commitments , the adoption of policies reaching across national borders , enhanced trade and financial flows , and markets which have become fully integrated on a global scale .  
The increasing spread of the social effects of economic phenomena , coupled with the rapid advances in technology , has made the coordination of economic policies at the international level more significant than ever before .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .  
Despite the progress achieved , the increasing tragedies and the escalation of massive and systematic violations are brutal reminders of the ease and frequency with which the noble ideal of defending human rights can be compromised .  
Among the complex tasks of reviving the economy there is one solid priority : the formation of a national market and a continuously growing solvent internal consumer demand with an increasing share in the production structure .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
The speaker explained that there was an increased level of business risk flowing from increasing levels of environmental legislation and growing public interest in corporate compliance .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
The Government has launched a major programme of reforming the public sector aimed at improving the capacity for efficient service delivery , devolving administrative power from the centre and increasing democratic participation in local government .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
He expressed the Communitys concern at the growth of transnational organized crime whose many facets and increasing sophistication threatened not only national and global security but also political stability and social and cultural values the world over .  
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
In a world marked by rapid change and increasing economic globalization , concerted action at the national and international levels was vital to renewed growth and development .  
Owing to the hard economic pressures created by the comprehensive embargo imposed on Iraq , large numbers of Iraqi women were forced to abandon working life by resigning or retiring from jobs because of fast increasing living costs and inadequate salaries .  
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
The reports of the experts are equally ominous .  A lack of safe drinking water for more than one third of the world 's population , continuing soil degradation , increasing global warming , unchecked urbanization , influxes of refugees , population growth and a failure to protect the fragile mountain ecosystem are some of the threatening signs .  
As a result of unchecked environmental degradation , we anticipate an increasing number of human health crises , involving the spread of infectious diseases , more cases of malnutrition and increasing health problems associated with global atmospheric change .  
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
Although the need to strengthen international economic cooperation based on the principles of international law and recognized norms had been reiterated in most intergovernmental fora , there was increasing recourse to unilateral coercive economic measures and the enactment of domestic laws with extraterritorial effects .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to a variety of global environmental systems , it is important to consider the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy demands for goods and other services .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
With the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance , those instruments provide a foundation for promoting and maintaining the rule of law , a basic requisite for sustainable socio-economic development ; furnish a basis for Governments to assess their systems , formulate legislation and develop effective tools for controlling national and transnational forms of crime ; and provide a framework for technical assistance , which in turn serves as a catalyst for their implementation .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
Reaffirming the important role of non-governmental organizations in the promotion of all human rights and in humanitarian activities at the national , regional and international levels , and appreciating their contribution to increasing public awareness of human rights issues , to the conduct of education , training and research in this field , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52 / 12 B ;  
The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .  
The Committee is particularly concerned with the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .
