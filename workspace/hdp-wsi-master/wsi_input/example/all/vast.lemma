When humans in remote antiquity thought about their own origins , and then went on to ponder the origins of the vast universe , they explained it in terms of magical forces , and in the process created large numbers of heavenly and earthly spirits .

Then , under Helen 's command , the US special mixed fleet turned and fled toward the open waters .  In 1996 , when the PLA conducted a military exercise including test-firing its guided missiles , the United States also sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait .

This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
Although the route is long , because the roadside scenery is so enchanting - - mostly palm oil trees , one of Malaysia 's special products , with a vast , seemingly limitless plain , and clear open skies occasionally broken up by a raised Malay house - - and the land so large and the people so few , driving is fast and even soothing . The only thing is that you have to keep an eye open all the time for the periodic slow-moving ox on the edge of the road . "  
Perestroika , Glasnost , and so on gave Soviet citizens a temporary vision of hope and prosperity . But the subsequent conservative reaction , economic difficulties , material shortages , and the threat of national disintegration have swept this vast and ancient land . "  
Following Taiwan 's economic development , with a huge trade surplus , vast foreign exchange reserves , and a per capita income of US $ 8,000 , Taiwan 's economic strength was visible everywhere , and had become adequate to bear the costs of buying " intellectual property . "  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
A Young Forty : It 's a natural human instinct to love singing . Although some criticize Taiwan 's KTV culture as being vulgar , and there are even more people who loudly complain that you have to go to supplementary school even for karaoke , for the vast majority of those who love to sing , whatever the cost in time and money , it 's worth it for that moment of joy of singing a song well , and soaking up the sounds of applause .

Chiang Hsiao-shan points out even though the vast majority of patients are open , extroverted , positive types with a considerable degree of self-confidence who are bold enough to want to change their image , the longing for a better appearance often involves tangled emotional complexes that are difficult to resolve , and most doctors must still carefully evaluate the patients who walk in their doors .  
In Mexico , for example , 12.5 square meters of forest are burned for each 11 kilograms of formula produced . Waste from the cows creates vast amounts of methane , adding to global warming . It requires a great deal of energy to manufacture dry powdered milk from the original milk . Packaging requires the expenditure and waste of large amounts of tin , aluminum , and plastic ; for example in the U . S . 550 million empty formula tins are discarded annually , while Taiwan throws away about five million .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
Critics hold that Red Sorghum , which carries the mysterious colors of silence on the vast northern plain on which it is set and describes a strong northern man taking a wife , and Judou , which describes the melancholy of a beautiful women suppressing her sexuality , are both " packaged in exoticness . "  
The complexity of the engineering for Three Gorges has enabled the two sides to produce vast amounts of technical material on flood prevention , electrical power generation , transport , economic efficiency , water supply , siltation , and similar subjects . There are even cases of mainland engineers being labelled as " rightist " and having their whole families dragged down with them just because they opposed the project .  
Recalling that time when he was first struck by computerized printing , Lee seems a bit hesitant and unenthusiastic . " Everybody just cursed .

He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
On the other side of the bridge , the road climbs an embankment and approximately one hour later enters a tunnel and passes through to the quintessential stretch of road skirting the Chulu Cliffs . At a height of 770 meters above sea level , the view is astonishing and vast ; the quality of the road is excellent .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
But in previous years when public health insurance was principally administered under labor insurance , limitations in terms of equipment , manpower , and even information about the total number of monthly registered cases in all the clinics and hospitals , made it completely unattainable . Computerized statistical analysis and cross-referencing of the vast amounts of information was even farther outside the realm of possibility .  
After a period of groping , it is not too hard to get accustomed to the convenience of electronic bulletin boards . But the truly worrisome part is still to come . Simply looking at the vast stream of information could make a person dizzy . But we all may be wondering , if I do n't get on the Net soon , am I going to fall behind the times ? (

The hospital was on the ground floor , with the family 's living quarters above . On the landing , Peng 's mother would put pails of disinfectant and water , with which the children would have to wash themselves before being allowed upstairs .

A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
When humans in remote antiquity thought about their own origins , and then went on to ponder the origins of the vast universe , they explained it in terms of magical forces , and in the process created large numbers of heavenly and earthly spirits . The sense which humans have always had of being mere visitors in this dusty world , along with their harsh struggle for existence , caused them to believe in , and later to seek and to fashion , a better world .  
By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research .

He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .

The DPP does not carry the historical burden of this conflict , and has already relaxed its ideological limitations . I was born and raised in Taiwan , and all my family and assets are here in Taiwan . My fate is linked to the fate of the vast majority of Taiwan 's people .

The performance starts off with a thunderous stampede of bass drums symbolizing the creation of the earth , followed by the pitty-pat of small drums that re-create the very first rain drops . The rainfall starts with a desultory plop-plop , then gradually grows into a deluge that creates the vast and boundless seas . The forceful drumming of the male drummers calls to mind ocean waves crashing into a rocky seacoast .  
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline . His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley . Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "

To be fair , this time around government agencies at every level were unstinting in their rescue efforts , communication and command systems worked well , and the response was swift .

The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .

Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans .
