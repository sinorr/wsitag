The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
Every communist , especially the leading cadres , must take warning from this , and truly succeed in being completely upright and uncorrupted , resist the lure of power , money , and sex with noble communist uprightness , and uphold and carry forward the quality and demeanor of communists .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
It is worth mentioning that the Fifth " Five-Year Plan " period was timed with the Third " Five-Year " campaign launched in China to spread legal knowledge among the citizens , which was held in the course of China 's building a socialist market economic system and under the great backdrop of the party putting forward , at the 15th CPC national congress , the proposal of administering the country according to laws and of building China into a socialist country that is ruled by laws .  
In diplomatic work , Comrade Geng Biao was firm on matters of principle and flexible on matters of tactics .  He put forward his unique viewpoints and creative ideas in light of the developing and changing situation .  He displayed very strong grasp of policy and strong mastery of the art of struggle .  
In cases in which counties and villages ( towns ) are really hard pressed financially once fees are replaced with taxes , the financial authorities at the national and provincial levels should shift sufficient funds to ensure that this major reform goes forward smoothly .  
In his " On New Democracy " , written in his Yanan days , Mao Zedong put forward this slogan : " A national , scientific , popular new democratic culture . "  He defined the characteristics and direction of China 's new culture in terms of " science " and put forward the following definition of " scientific : " " It means opposing all feudal thought and superstitious thought , advocating the seeking of truth from facts , upholding objective truth , and insisting that theory and practice be consistent with each other " .  
In this way , they have effectively solved the difficult problem of insufficient sustained supporting strength for the airborne troops , and the airborne troops now have reliable " mobile warehouses " .  This indicates the airborne troops have taken a historical leap forward from being able to air-drop troops alone to being able to conduct combined operations .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
China has preliminarily established the socialist market economic system .  The " Proposal " has not put forward more specific targets .  It only sets a single target of a predictive nature to " double the GDP " by 2010 .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
That Putin lost no time in putting forward his proposals before attending the informal meeting of APEC leaders on 15 November shows that Russia is ready to continue to greatly reduce and finally eliminate nuclear arms on the basis of maintaining strategic stability ; and using the forum of the unofficial meeting of APEC leaders to publicize Russia 's ideas was for the purpose of gaining further international support on this issue .  
the United States , today , should " establish an international system composed of strong alliances and organizations " with other democratic partners , and should " also be ready to step forward to defend these standards ( meaning the US concepts of values ) when they are threatened . "  
and the leaders of regional organizations .  President Jiang Zemin put forward a four-point proposal at the meeting designed to strengthen Sino-African cooperation and promote the creation of a new international economic and political order .  His proposal won universal praise from those in attendance .  
The current national security concept was put forward by Clinton in 1993 .  Clinton held that as the United States holds obvious military strength and military technology superiority over any other potential rivals , it is completely possible to effectively respond to certain crises and to deal with uncertain factors anytime in the future .  
and opened up China 's future .  It was their great thinking , noble character , and immortal achievements that inspired us to carry forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and courageously forge ahead into the future .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
The Party Central Committee rallying around Comrade Jiang Zemin raised high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and led forward the entire party and all the peoples of the nation along the road pointed out by Deng Xiaoping Theory , achieving numerous new successes in the building of socialism , while at the same time continuously pursuing theoretical development and innovation based on new experiences and new situations .  
Our undertaking of reform , opening up and socialist modernization has been pushed forward into a new stage .  In China today , it is a scene of political stability , economic development , national unity , social progress , constantly improving living standard , and prosperity .  
After the establishment of socialism in China , its age-old image of poverty and weakness underwent a rapid change ; regardless of repeated frustrations and complications , China 's economic growth rate was among the highest in the world , its gross national product jumped forward to rank seventh in the world .  
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
Within a very short period of 20 years , Chinese economy made huge progress , the people 's living standards rose to a new height , and the integrated national strength made an enormous step forward .  
Second , it is positively implementing strategic adjustment of the economic structure , and it is doing all we can to achieve comprehensive advancement of tertiary industries in the direction of speeding up the development of modern service industries , powerfully developing high-tech industries , and positively moving modernization of agriculture forward .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
Pilotless combat planes can complete various missions without the limitations set by the human body , such as approaching close to forward positions , carrying ground tracking sensors , synthetic aperture radar sensors , moving target indicators , and so on , or else doing on-the-spot monitoring of chemical and biological substances .  
It is for this reason that Comrade Luo Gan put forward at the mobilization meeting that efforts must be made to ferret out and severely punish according to law the " protective umbrellas " and the backstage supporters in the party , government and judicial organs who support the criminal and vicious groups .  It is also essential to thoroughly destroy the social soil that breeds the criminal and vicious groups , he said .  
All in all , to continuously accelerate reform and construction in the military and fulfill the sacred mission , the military must vigorously promote the spirit of emancipating their thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the development of the era and innovating courageously , the spirit of unswervingly marching forward despite difficulties , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness , and the spirit of disregarding personal fame and interests , being unselfish and dedicating oneself .  
The spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will is the precious spiritual wealth made by the Party and the military through prolonged revolutionary and construction practices as well as the embodiment of the positive spiritual state of both Party members and revolutionary military professionals .  
Now that China has constantly enhanced her national strength in an all-round way , generally speaking , the Sino-US relations are expected to move forward in spite of frequent friction , and out of considerations for its own strategic interests , the United States is also expected to carry on its arms sales to Taiwan within limited space only . 
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have now entered a critical stage , and the unfinished final position negotiations involve the most complex and sensitive issues ; it is difficult to take one step forward , which requires tremendous efforts on both sides .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
Speeding up the establishment of a social security system is now the key issue in deepening enterprise reform and speeding up structural adjustment ; it has a bearing on efforts by enterprises to separate out their social functions and cut personnel to improve efficiency , on whether the reassignment of laid-off personnel to other jobs can move forward or not , and on whether the task of upgrading the industrial structure and improving enterprise efficiency can be accomplished smoothly .  It has become a critical task .  
Under the leadership of local party committee and government and with the support of the broad masses of the people , public security organs at various places have carried forward the spirit of brave fight and persistent battle , hit hard , moved toward a good beginning of the special target struggle on " hitting the mob and eliminating devils , " and obtained preliminary results .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .

The five kinds of spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin are a new development and summation of various kinds of lofty spirit that have emerged in a long process of the party 's cause of uniting with and fighting together with the people .  They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .  
The spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties and forging ahead relentlessly has encouraged us to continuously climb up to the summit despite hardship and danger with an indomitable and tenacious will and a heroic mettle of fighting unyieldingly and daring to win a victory .  
The spirit of struggling hard and obtaining practical results demands that we carry forward the fine spirit of the party , build up our country through hard work and frugality , be industrious and thrifty in managing all undertakings and vigorously carry forward the fine work style of speaking the plain truth , seeking practical results and trying our best to fulfill our responsibility .  The spirit of not hankering after fame and fortune and tendering selfless devotion has demanded that we always think of the people and the party 's cause .  
The majority of retired military cadres should maintain and carry forward the excellent traditions of our military , conscientiously be considerate of difficulties faced by governments at all levels , align personal interests with overall ones , embrace and support reform in ones behavior and make new contributions to strengthening the country and revitalizing the Chinese nation .  
The United States government has , year after year , taken China , a nation with thriving business opportunities , improving daily , and constant improvements in the people 's economy , politics , society and culture , a country where all nationalities come together to construct their own special brand of socialism , and harshly portrayed her as a country where all kinds of rights are exploited , where social order is overturned , a nation which has no path forward .  
To continuously advance military construction and reform , fulfill the sacred mission placed on the shoulders of our military , we must carry forward the spirit of emancipating thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of keeping up with the times and courageously innovating , the spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness and the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
Deputies pledged to carry forward the spirit of incessant struggle advocated by President Jiang , have a high sense of political and historical responsibility , strengthen army building in an all-round way , and score good results in the two historical subjects of " winning the battle " and " never changing color " .  
The relaxed environment , the propitious atmosphere , and the enterprising ambition have enabled the people who , from generation to generation , have longed for a better life in the world to come , to treasure , from the innermost depths of their hearts , their good life today , look forward to the bright future , and fight for it with indefatigable struggle .  
Therefore , for party organizations at all levels of our army , a most essential and most direct task in their implementation of " three represents " is to conscientiously implement the strategy of reinforcing the army and invigorating military training through science and technology , a strategy that has been put forward by the Central Military Commission ; strive to meet high standards in enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops ; pay close attention to training the troops through science and technology ;  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .

First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
An important experience we have accumulated in administrating military units at grass-roots level lies in sticking to " one group and two contingents . "  Practice has shown that every military unit with a solid contingent of party members is strong .  This unit can stand forward at crucial moments and confront difficulties and dangers .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .

Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .

This is the most basic requirement of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , as well as the scientific methodology of Marxism .

carry forward the spirit of advocating science , undertaking audacious explorations , making bold innovations , and being brave in scaling the heights of science ; actively participate in policy-making consultations on major issues concerning economic and social development ; and devote themselves in all earnestness to the great undertaking of modernization so as to make greater contributions to China 's move toward a powerful country through science and technology , to the realization of rapid economic growth , and to the great revitalization of the Chinese nation .  
Under the current social conditions where China is carrying out reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , the broad masses of academicians and scientists of the older generation should pay special attention to teaching , helping , and guiding the younger generation ideologies , work style , and academic attitudes .  They should teach them to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and to consolidate their determination to devote their lives to scientific undertakings and their confidence to attain new accomplishments .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .

He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
Under new historical conditions , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and continuing to draw on fresh experiences , has put forward many new and important ideas and points of view , mapped out a series of interrelated moves , and creatively inherited and developed the theories of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping on party building .  
adhere to the principles of " making the past serve the present , " " making foreign things serve China , " and " weeding through the old to bring forth the new , " actively inherit and carry forward outstanding traditional cultures , study hard , absorb , and use as reference outstanding foreign cultures while resisting all corrupt and decadent ideas and cultures of the exploiting class and opposing the " Westernization " and " division " schemes of hostile forces at home and abroad .  
This requires us to have an insight into the general international situation and a profound understanding of China 's conditions .  It requires us to put forward a correct political line and formulate feasible principles and policies based on a clearly defined historical mission .  
It is fair to say that the " three represents " is essential if our party is going to adapt to the new situation , meet the new challenges , and push forward socialist modernization in an all-round way , and that it is a great strategy that has bearing on the growth , flourishing , and lasting order and stability of the party and state .  
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese scientists and engineers have exhibited their wisdom and talents and creatively resolved many major scientific and technological problems , swiftly narrowing the gap with advanced world levels in some important fields and effectively bringing forward China 's economic and social development .  
Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait .

In deploying this strategic plan , the western region must clearly understand and grasp the international and domestic economic situations , take the changing situations into consideration , adopt the appropriate measures to push their economic work forward , and use expanded opening up to give impetus to development .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
It has been learned that since the founding of New China , the large number of science and technology personnel and workers of departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work , tackled and solved one difficult technological problem after another , ensured the needs of the development of science and technology for national defense , and made important contribution to the modernization of national defense and economic construction .  
The correct way to adapt oneself to the new challenges in international security , safeguard world peace , and protect the legitimate security interests of different countries is not to undermine the " ABM Treaty " but to push forward the establishment of a new , just , and rational international political order , abandon power politics and the arbitrary use of force in international affairs , and further strengthen regional and international security .  
By continuing to maintain and push forward the current favorable situation in economic growth , our country will be able to further effect sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .

I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations .

An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds .

The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years .

" Thus someone living in Harbin would be So-and-so Harbin , " he says by way of illustration . The Ching emperor Chien Lung ( 1736-1796 ) decided that the surname-less Jurchen consequently fell into rampant incestuous marriages . Only after a long period did fixed clan names evolve . The names of the eight Manchurian tribes were first recorded and explained in the Complete Record of the Family Names of the Eight Banners , so it was only from this time forward that the Jurchen had a relatively well-ordered system of family names .

All these keep investors from moving forward . "

At 5:55 am , five minutes before the race begins , a white Honda Civic pulls up in front of the front gate . A group of people swiftly get out and rush toward the starting line . Right then , from either side , the pack of teenage girls that have already been waiting for a long time impulsively rushes forward , but half way there , workers shout at them , " Back up , back up ! They 're about to start running , you 'll be knocked over . "  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
Many people were taken by their parents deep into the mountains to be tattooed in secret . The preconditions for having tattoos were gradually relaxed . Males no longer had to have hunted a human head , and females no longer had to be able to weave . The age at which facial tattooing occurred was also moved forward ; many children and adolescents had facial tattoos early , according to their parents ' wishes .  
These figures suggest citizens ' ability to separate the individual from the issue at stake and to be both hard-headed and sympathetic . This again reminds us that freedom and democracy are our most precious assets , and that open debate creates an informed electorate . We look forward to the people nudging the government and society to be ever-more efficient and competitive .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
According to Liu , the new US-Japanese guidelines can be seen as an example of " soft containment " by a maritime power against a continental power . It is very worthy of note , in this regard , that the PRC-which has , under Jiang Zemin , repaired relations with the US-responded much less angrily than was expected to the revised guidelines . Indeed the PRC has continued to move forward actively in relations with the US .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
Ho Chun-jui continues : " There are other aspects as well , such as smashing ' the virgin complex , ' resisting domestic violence , and gay activism . Everywhere you can see that gender self-awareness does n't have to be taught , that it is flowing through society . A future in which everyone is conscious of gender issues is not only inevitable , it is to be looked forward to . "  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
Over 50 bronze heads were discovered at Sanxingdui , and they feature a wide variety of headgear , including gold masks , fancy hairstyles , braided head bands , and curly hair that seems to surge forward like breakers at the beach .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
It involves eighteen countries , headed by the US , the UK , Japan , Germany , France and mainland China . The project was originally scheduled for completion in 2005 , but intense competition from a privately owned gene-sequencing company , Celera Genomics , spurred the multinational team to bring forward its timetable , and a full , precise map of the human genome is now expected before 2003 .  
Understanding the structure of the universe is a long-standing dream of astronomers . In the past our understanding of cosmic structure was based on little more than theoretical speculation . Before 1990 , it was difficult to test the plethora of cosmological theories being put forward by a growing number of brilliant theorists .  
With reference to the mainland 's ill-considered and arbitrary actions , some political commentators put forward the interpretation that with the Communist Party of China 's 16th national congress imminent and a new leadership line-up about to emerge , mainland politicians jostling for positions of power were eager to put on an impressive performance , so they adopted a more hawkish posture .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
Lee Shan-ren of the Taiwan Agriculture Strategy Coalition , remembers a ' 70s television program entitled Provisional Government Mailbox which specialized in answering problems encountered by farmers . " Technological developments in Taiwan 's agriculture have never ceased to move forward , " says Lee . With its myriad technological breakthroughs , agricultural testing institutions , experimental farms , fishery testing institutions , and private enterprises , Taiwan is one of the best in the research and development of new agricultural strains .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
The New Year vacation recently over , the flourishing Taiwan publishing industry rolled up its sleeves in eager anticipation and prepared to put its best foot forward for the tenth annual Taipei International Book Exhibit ( TIBE ) scheduled for February 19-24 . Many book lovers were hoping to take advantage of the exhibit as the various publishing houses came together in one place and promoted special discount sales for books to be sold during the last four days of the six-day event .  
Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
Although this has been a bitter test , after six years of experience , Chuang Ming-yi and the entire community now feel a strong sense of mission . This major fire has only made them even more aware of how fast things can change , so they are even more determined to move forward .  
Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
Chen 's sense of fashion made a deep impression on me the first time we met . Still short of his 40th birthday , he was dressed in a smartly tailored black suit . The collar was turned up , and he looked a bit like the dashing lead in some detective movie . His hair was combed forward and upward , as is very much in style these days .  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
In addition to private entrepreneurs abandoning their hide-bound attitudes and moving forward hand in hand to develop the market , the Executive Yuan 's plan to double the number of foreign tourists was already on track last year with an estimated investment over the next six years of almost NT $ 80 billion and a yearly target for visitors to Taiwan in 2003 and beyond of three million , up from 2.6 million of previous years .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
After you go abroad , broaden your world-view and get to know more people , you become more independent and confident . I am no longer nervous when I have to speak in front of crowds . I am always looking forward to meeting new friends anytime and anywhere . I have developed a new attitude toward my future life , and my English has surely improved very much .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
Sunlight streams in through the flowering cherry trees in the garden and falls on a bare wooden table , where a sprig of pinstripe ginger rests in elegant simplicity on a bamboo mat , compelling time to slow its forward march for a moment .

Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .

One representative considered that , while making the establishment of a fact finding commission compulsory represented a step forward , the optional character of recourse to conciliation constituted a step backward with respect to the conventions on codification concluded in recent decades .  266 .

The agreement put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army ( SLA ) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support .

The recent conclusion of an agreement to this end between the two parties is a positive step , which , in spite of certain difficulties which emerged , deserves to be encouraged and supported .

Such steps included : lifting the blockade on the Palestinian territories ; refraining from violating the terms of the bilateral agreements including the imposition of collective punishment in violation of international humanitarian law ; redeploying Israeli forces from Hebron ; establishing a corridor between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which would ensure contacts between the Palestinian territories ; releasing all Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons ; and pressing forward with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Area B on the West Bank .  
The Commission should realize that the necessity of strengthening those defences within the context of a project codifying for the first time the unwritten law of unilateral enforcement of international obligations , offers a most appropriate - and , in a sense , unique - opportunity to take a few valuable steps forward in the international law of dispute settlement , the development of which is characterized by an abundance of lip service which is inversely proportional to the number of really effective , " hard law " obligations assumed by States .

It is at least arguable that the reason why incorrect and seemingly perverse resource allocation , management or land conversion decisions are made in forestry is not that those involved in the decision-making process are unaware of the correct valuation techniques or incapable of applying them , but rather that vested interests operating in the sector are simply unwilling to consider the alternatives such analysis might put forward .

The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .

"  
Today , by stressing that our party should always represent the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , Comrade Jiang Zemin has upheld and further elaborated , under the present new situation , the most fundamental realistic foundation and philosophical prerequisite of the party-building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
has reiterated the principal position of the masses of the people , as well as our fundamental aim in bringing about a social , economic , and cultural development ; and has further straightened the relationship that the party should act as a " public servant " to the people .  This is a continued adherence and a new development to the party building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .

If we combine requirements and possibilities in our considerations , we discover that our army and those of developed Western countries show remarkable differences .

National conditions , military conditions , and the requirements of the " three steps forward " strategy have all determined that our army must pursue equipment development in strides .  
The surpassing road selected by the strategy of " three steps forward " means that , observing objective laws , one can pursue development in strides , skipping over stages .  It does not , however , set false objectives and diverge from reality , or mean that development in strides means arbitrarily skipping over certain necessary developmental stages , or inappropriately raising the objectives of the next stage of development .

Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .

He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .

At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .

They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .

This is the most basic requirement of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , as well as the scientific methodology of Marxism . Marx , Engels , Lenin , and Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping were all adept at putting forward new ideology and theories based on actual development changes .  
carry forward the spirit of advocating science , undertaking audacious explorations , making bold innovations , and being brave in scaling the heights of science ; actively participate in policy-making consultations on major issues concerning economic and social development ; and devote themselves in all earnestness to the great undertaking of modernization so as to make greater contributions to China 's move toward a powerful country through science and technology , to the realization of rapid economic growth , and to the great revitalization of the Chinese nation .  
Under the current social conditions where China is carrying out reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , the broad masses of academicians and scientists of the older generation should pay special attention to teaching , helping , and guiding the younger generation ideologies , work style , and academic attitudes .  They should teach them to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and to consolidate their determination to devote their lives to scientific undertakings and their confidence to attain new accomplishments .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
We must persist in getting some things done and leaving others undone , do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the key points , and concentrate finance and materials on resolving a number of major problems with a bearing on the overall situation of western development , so as to lead forward overall western development .  
In discussing which chief modes should be adopted for cultivating military cadres by relying on general higher education , this responsible person stated that in the " Decision " , three main modes are put forward : choosing cadres for cultivation from within schools , directly accepting into the corps graduates from general higher level institutions , and soliciting students studying national defense .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
Meeting participants , using Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking " Three Represents " as guidance and targeting current prominent issues in public order , studied and put forward suggestions to improve comprehensive management of the social order .  
When handling cases and problems , political and law organs are urged to enhance consciousness in the comprehensive management of public order , and while cracking down on law-breaking and on criminal activities , to consider problems from the angle of crime prevention , to search for reasons for criminal activity and to discover loopholes in the law through the handling of cases , to put forward preventive measures , to help relevant departments improve management system , strengthen education on the legal system , and implement preventive measures .

He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
Under new historical conditions , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and continuing to draw on fresh experiences , has put forward many new and important ideas and points of view , mapped out a series of interrelated moves , and creatively inherited and developed the theories of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping on party building .  
adhere to the principles of " making the past serve the present , " " making foreign things serve China , " and " weeding through the old to bring forth the new , " actively inherit and carry forward outstanding traditional cultures , study hard , absorb , and use as reference outstanding foreign cultures while resisting all corrupt and decadent ideas and cultures of the exploiting class and opposing the " Westernization " and " division " schemes of hostile forces at home and abroad .  
This requires us to have an insight into the general international situation and a profound understanding of China 's conditions .  It requires us to put forward a correct political line and formulate feasible principles and policies based on a clearly defined historical mission .  
It is fair to say that the " three represents " is essential if our party is going to adapt to the new situation , meet the new challenges , and push forward socialist modernization in an all-round way , and that it is a great strategy that has bearing on the growth , flourishing , and lasting order and stability of the party and state .  
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese scientists and engineers have exhibited their wisdom and talents and creatively resolved many major scientific and technological problems , swiftly narrowing the gap with advanced world levels in some important fields and effectively bringing forward China 's economic and social development .  
Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .  
President Jiang Zemin delivered a written speech at the airport .  He said mankind is looking forward to the dawn of the 21st century , adding that people hope this century will be a century of peace and development , for the establishment of a new , just and rational international political and economic order in this century , and for brilliant human civilization in this century .  
In deploying this strategic plan , the western region must clearly understand and grasp the international and domestic economic situations , take the changing situations into consideration , adopt the appropriate measures to push their economic work forward , and use expanded opening up to give impetus to development .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
It has been learned that since the founding of New China , the large number of science and technology personnel and workers of departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work , tackled and solved one difficult technological problem after another , ensured the needs of the development of science and technology for national defense , and made important contribution to the modernization of national defense and economic construction .  
The correct way to adapt oneself to the new challenges in international security , safeguard world peace , and protect the legitimate security interests of different countries is not to undermine the " ABM Treaty " but to push forward the establishment of a new , just , and rational international political order , abandon power politics and the arbitrary use of force in international affairs , and further strengthen regional and international security .  
By continuing to maintain and push forward the current favorable situation in economic growth , our country will be able to further effect sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
Members of the CPC Financial and Economic Committee held : Investments by non-state economic sectors have become an important force for pushing our country 's economic growth forward .  In the first half of the year , the growth of investment by urban and rural collectives and by individual persons picked up to some extent , but the speed was still rather slow .  
The participants unanimously held that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech was a brilliant exposition and very rich in content .

"  They said that mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors have positive significance on promoting the two cities ' economic and cultural exchanges and developing their relations .  People on both sides of the strait are optimistically looking forward to the success of their visits .  
At the same time , however , we should also be clearly aware that some state enterprises are still faced with great difficulties , and the task of deepening reform remains extremely arduous .  In view of this , we must act in line with the requirements put forward by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , seize the present favorable opportunities , integrate our solution of current predominant problems with our fulfillment of long-term development targets , and create favorable conditions for the cross-century development of state enterprises .

Faced with a historical and culturat situation of apparent " change and decay in all around , " his section title From Fin-de-si ? cle to Fin-de-si ? cle , and the Four Predictions which he goes so far as to put forward , are actually a sign of his deep sense of sympathy for the time and concern for his faraway country , although this is not necessarily expressed in gloomy , sorrowful language .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate .

" Thus someone living in Harbin would be So-and-so Harbin , " he says by way of illustration . The Ching emperor Chien Lung ( 1736-1796 ) decided that the surname-less Jurchen consequently fell into rampant incestuous marriages . Only after a long period did fixed clan names evolve . The names of the eight Manchurian tribes were first recorded and explained in the Complete Record of the Family Names of the Eight Banners , so it was only from this time forward that the Jurchen had a relatively well-ordered system of family names .  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
Q : Your book puts forward quite a few interesting observations . One of these was that certain illnesses are exclusive to Taiwan , such as " ghost phobia " and " taboo phobia . " Also , you observed that China 's historical phenomenon of communal speech-making seems similar to the modern group therapy sessions currently popular in the West .  
There is greater flexibility in the forward progress of the experimental classes . Teachers can design instructional activities to meet the needs of the curriculum .

The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs . Some are bearing little palanquins in which are seated statues of the village gods ; they excitedly crowd around Matsu 's seat of honor as it moves its way forward .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
On main thoroughfares and in little lanes , in supermarkets , in record stores , in taxicabs . . . . everywhere you turn you can hear her sweet voice resonating : The singing has stopped Drink a final cup of wine I chat and talk of anything To ease your troubled mind Life has few opportunities for intoxication Why not look forward to them ?  
For instance , to the sound of Chinese flute music they would walk from one end of the practice hall to the other , on the way changing themselves into a seed which pushes its way out of the ground , then sprouts and flowers ; or into a prisoner in a deep dark dungeon who slowly crawls out to see the sunlight ; or a condemned man walking to the execution ground , who is struck by a bullet and falls down , but continues to struggle forward clutching his wound .  
The elephant veteranWhen they arrived at the military base at the head of Fengshan Bay , Ah-Lan passed away , perhaps because she could not adjust to the new environs . And because the military was not actively engaged , the remaining two elephants could only look forward to retirement . Later on , they were sent straight up to the Taipei Zoo , then located in the northern suburb of Yuanshan .  
The reason there is still such a dazzling array of species on Earth today , with all the " natural wonders " they display , is because since life took its first steps , animals have shown a resilient capacity to face the challenges of all kinds of environmental pressures , by every imaginable means . Although the process has been a bloody one in which many species have bowed out into history , new species have continuously stepped forward onto the stage .  
The songs of the Ami can be traced back to their fishing , farming , and hunting activities in the mountains and along the coast . In their tightly organized villages , through the annual harvest festival , each successive generation was trained and educated in cultural traditions , which is the main reason these songs have been carried forward .  
At 5:55 am , five minutes before the race begins , a white Honda Civic pulls up in front of the front gate . A group of people swiftly get out and rush toward the starting line . Right then , from either side , the pack of teenage girls that have already been waiting for a long time impulsively rushes forward , but half way there , workers shout at them , " Back up , back up ! They 're about to start running , you 'll be knocked over . "  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
Many people were taken by their parents deep into the mountains to be tattooed in secret . The preconditions for having tattoos were gradually relaxed . Males no longer had to have hunted a human head , and females no longer had to be able to weave . The age at which facial tattooing occurred was also moved forward ; many children and adolescents had facial tattoos early , according to their parents ' wishes .  
These figures suggest citizens ' ability to separate the individual from the issue at stake and to be both hard-headed and sympathetic . This again reminds us that freedom and democracy are our most precious assets , and that open debate creates an informed electorate . We look forward to the people nudging the government and society to be ever-more efficient and competitive .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
According to Liu , the new US-Japanese guidelines can be seen as an example of " soft containment " by a maritime power against a continental power . It is very worthy of note , in this regard , that the PRC-which has , under Jiang Zemin , repaired relations with the US-responded much less angrily than was expected to the revised guidelines . Indeed the PRC has continued to move forward actively in relations with the US .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
Ho Chun-jui continues : " There are other aspects as well , such as smashing ' the virgin complex , ' resisting domestic violence , and gay activism . Everywhere you can see that gender self-awareness does n't have to be taught , that it is flowing through society . A future in which everyone is conscious of gender issues is not only inevitable , it is to be looked forward to . "  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .

So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
It involves eighteen countries , headed by the US , the UK , Japan , Germany , France and mainland China .

With reference to the mainland 's ill-considered and arbitrary actions , some political commentators put forward the interpretation that with the Communist Party of China 's 16th national congress imminent and a new leadership line-up about to emerge , mainland politicians jostling for positions of power were eager to put on an impressive performance , so they adopted a more hawkish posture .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages .

Lee Shan-ren of the Taiwan Agriculture Strategy Coalition , remembers a ' 70s television program entitled Provisional Government Mailbox which specialized in answering problems encountered by farmers .

If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward .

Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .

Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
Chen 's sense of fashion made a deep impression on me the first time we met . Still short of his 40th birthday , he was dressed in a smartly tailored black suit .

At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .

Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography .

After you go abroad , broaden your world-view and get to know more people , you become more independent and confident . I am no longer nervous when I have to speak in front of crowds .

Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .

If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies .

It is at least arguable that the reason why incorrect and seemingly perverse resource allocation , management or land conversion decisions are made in forestry is not that those involved in the decision-making process are unaware of the correct valuation techniques or incapable of applying them , but rather that vested interests operating in the sector are simply unwilling to consider the alternatives such analysis might put forward .
