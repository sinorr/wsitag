The funds raised by " Shenye Holding Company " this time will primarily be invested in developing intercity bus service , national car rental network , and in the existing real estate projects , to build up an integrated enterprise with Hong Kong as a base and Shenzhen as a business focus .  
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
Leaders of respective places and units are convinced that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech has penetratingly analyzed the current situation and existing problems in party building from the strategic level of initiating a great project to improve the party , has incisively explained the great significance and utmost importance of tightening party discipline under the new situation , has put forward demands for tightening party discipline , and has clearly pointed out directions for improving the party 's style of work , promoting the building of a clean and honest government and launching struggles against corruption .  
Li Peng hoped that the leading group and cadres in Zhangjiagang City will , from the high plane of laying emphasis on politics , identify problems from the development and dialectical viewpoint , adhere to the high standard and strict demands , exert pressure on themselves , go all out to forge ahead , and conscientiously investigate , look for , and resolve the existing outstanding problems , as well as lead the people throughout the city to open up new prospects in the reform and opening up and modernization construction in Zhangjiagang City .  
For this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .  Wei Jianxing emphasized : All the township ( town ) leading cadres across the country should keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
We must regard WTO accession as a fine opportunity to augment , readjust , and perfect China 's existing laws , regulations , and policies related to external economic work , speed up the effort to build and put on a sound basis the legal system of our economic and trade laws , and make full use of the means of law to protect our legitimate interests . 
The speech profoundly points out the existing problems and weak links in educational work , reflects Comrade Jiang Zemin 's great concern and care about education .  Not only the speech has realistic guiding significance on carrying out the Party 's educational policy in an all-round way and carrying forward our country 's education reform and development , but also will create profound historical influence .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
However , we should soberly perceive the existing problems .  Inadequate effective demand and contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure are still very prominent , and no new consumption hot spots are on the horizon .  Problems in our economic life accumulated over the years have all cropped up and the international market still has many uncertain factors - - we should place adequate importance on these problems .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
The eastern region has its own favorable conditions , and so do the central and western regions .  Therefore , what counts is how different regions can analyze and study their own favorable conditions in a realistic approach , establish a development strategy that suits each 's local conditions , and give a better rein to the existing superiorities while turning potential superiorities into realistic ones as soon as possible .  
In the economic and trade sphere , we should positively strive to set up the ' Fujian Experimental Zone for Economic Cooperation Across the Straits ' at an early date , continue to run the existing Taiwan-funded enterprises properly , fully exercise the demonstrative role of the Taiwan investment zone , accelerate the construction of the cross-strait agricultural cooperative experimental zone , have a good grasp of the pilot project of direct sea navigation , and positively explore the new path for direct trade across the straits .  
Now that Guangdong has built up considerable economic strength , how should it grasp the new opportunity and improve its overall economic quality through positive involvement in full-fledged competition in the international market on the basis of consolidating and developing the existing economy is a new task .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
It is necessary to make use of the existing funding channels , adjust the orientation of the input of funds and the thinking of building bases , strengthen dynamics in supporting agricultural construction projects in the western region , and focus attention on grasping the building of commodity grain , cotton and sugar-bearing crop production bases as well as dry-land crop and water-saving farming demonstration counties and pastoral area comprehensive development demonstration projects in the western region .  
Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;  
Jiang Zemin expressed his belief that his current visit would help further strengthen the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Israeli peoples and promote the comprehensive development of the existing friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
In view of the situation in which the amphibious warfare vehicles could not move forward under water and the wheeled canons could not land because of the poor geological conditions , such as sludge , and factors , such as waves , currents , shell craters , and ditches , the regiment made use of its existing bridge of boats equipment and set up a floating landing stage , thus enabling the heavy-duty equipment to reach the beach successfully in a forced landing .  
In order to accelerate the steps towards making a leap in training , we should extract from past " exhibitions " and " briefings " on real technology based on existing computer networks to train the troops , and rely on all training bases ' extensive opening up of simulated training to enable the troops to become familiar with and master information technology and equipment as soon as possible .  At the " pre-reality line " simulating real combat , we should promote informational training .  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
To strengthen the awareness of leaders at all levels in leading troops in war , the group army has promoted innovations centered on existing equipment , explored the battle method of winning against the enemy 's superiority under an unfavorable situation ; mastered automated field operation command ; enhanced comprehensive quality of officers and men ;  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
On the morning of 7 July , the Taiwan " MAC " demanded for the third time that the Kaohsiung city government send in supplementary materials " sufficient to judge the aim and itinerary of the visit " ; at 1650 the same afternoon , the " MAC " again demanded that the city further amend the supplementary material , and announced that the city must send in the supplementary material in accordance with the relevant existing regulations , before it could be checked and approved .  
The conclusions and requests coming out of the two meetings are diametrically opposed : The resolution of the Group of 77 Ministerial Conference called for changes to the existing irrational economic order , an appeal from the poor countries to the rich ones , while the document drawn up by the G-8 in the meeting in Okinawa involved regulations and requests by the developed countries with regard to the existing world order , and was more like orders issued by the rich countries to the poor ones .  
That is , with information as the leading factor , attention is paid to laterally renovating or improving the existing system of weapons so that they will be universally applicable and there will be a linkage between them .  This will facilitate accurate access , timely transmission and effective process and use of information , enhance the combined force of attack of the firepower system , thereby raising the overall efficiency of the weaponry and combat system .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
When one lacks a skeptical critical spirit and reveres all existing understanding as the absolute , the road to scientific progress , passing , breaking new ground , and innovation would be blocked .  
With the rapid development in the equipment and technical level of the Chinese armored unit , the new generation of the officers and men of the " heroic " tank unit are aiming for the frontier of the world 's high technology .  They , guided by actual combat requirements and relying on existing equipment potentials , have successfully revamped the Chinese army 's first digital tank .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
Chen Shui-bian expressed his belief that the leaders on both sides of the strait have sufficient wisdom and creativity , and are absolutely able to find some " common ground " and consensus acceptable to both sides , so as to jointly handle the issue of " a future one China " based on " existing foundations " .  
They removed barriers between different units and between different professions , used the existing support resources in a relatively concentrated way , put equipment under centralized and unified control and maintenance , shared the use of facilities and equipment , assigned specific units to plan and provide ammunition , materials , and equipment , made full use of existing equipment and tapped to the full the support potentials under the present conditions , and thus achieved the target of being optimized , portable , combined , and efficient .  
This division proceeded from the reality of its capacity for anti-air-raids with existing equipment , and comprehensively deployed all kinds of radar and optical observation instruments it had to form a well-conceived antiaircraft reconnaissance system with multiple reconnaissance networks and an " integrated multi-network early warning " system , thus enabling " all units were informed about the information obtained by any unit . "  
Since our army 's network and website building is still at such a primary stage as network personnel handling military issues and the majority of our army 's qualified personnel are still of technical support in nature and have yet to extensively develop or apply the existing hardware or software system in terms of functions and in light of operational decision , command , and tactic , faced with the fast advent of information warfare and network warfare , our army should make further efforts to carry out follow-up research ; explore countermeasures ; 
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .  
On the basis of extensively soliciting opinions from all parties concerned and conducting sufficient study or demonstrations , the General Political Department has formulated a draft amendment to our existing enlistment regulations governing officers in active service , and the draft amendment has been approved by an executive meeting of the State Council and an executive meeting of the Central Military Commission respectively . 
absorbed experiences of success in the reform of the state personnel system and Army cadre system in recent years ; drew on the beneficial practices of foreign armed forces ; and adjusted and reformed the existing system of officers ' service , in a bid to make all the relevant systems better suited to the development of the situation and the times .  
Mutual exchanges between Jinmen and Mazu on the one hand and Fujian 's coastal areas on another hand have been going on since a long time ago .  The so-called " mini three links " currently implemented by Taiwan authorities merely transformed such exchanges from " underground " to " the surface . "  Or just as what the Taiwan mass media pointed out , the measure would merely " decriminalize " the existing exchanges and does not have any realistic significance .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
While making conscientious efforts to run existing social security services well , we will speed up the formation of a social security system that is independent of enterprises and institutions , has diverse sources of funding and a standardized system of support services , and is run and managed by society , in order to guarantee the smooth progress of state-owned enterprise reform and structural adjustment and maintain the basic stability of society .  
In compliance with the trend in history and by giving account to Hong Kong 's situation and interests , the central authorities set forth the important principles of " one country , two systems , " " Hong Kong being governed by local people , " and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong . This is aimed at maintaining Hong Kong 's existing commodity city model in the operation of the market economy and enabling Hong Kong to continue to play an important role as a major trading port .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
Yang stressed that China 's accession to the WTO will have a profound impact on China 's economic and even political and social life and that the existing administrative and management concepts , systems , structures , methods , and means need to be transformed in an in-depth manner .  
The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
This university regarded this project as its key scientific research task , put in several hundred-thousand yuan to carry out research and development , and directly applied several major scientific research findings to transforming the existing weapons .  Through nearly two years of painstaking efforts to do research and to tackle problems , finally , this university successfully fulfilled the artillery digital transformation task , thus effectively enhancing the tactical and technical performances of towed artillery .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
The insufficient development of the tertiary industry is a principal problem existing in China 's industrial structure .  Since the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , given the rapid development attained in the tertiary industry and its increasing proportion held in the GDP , there is still a big gap as compared with other countries in the world .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
This meeting fully affirmed the results of the special campaign at the previous stage against smuggling , foreign exchange evasion , illegal foreign exchange remittance , and deceptive acquisition of tax reimbursement for export , as well as the joint operation against the law-breaking and criminal activities of producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy commodities ; thoroughly analyzed the severity and harmfulness of existing market economic disorder and the major causes of these problems ; set the principal tasks of rectifying and regulating the market economic order in the next five years and the work focuses this year ;  
In the 1982 and 1986 revisions to history textbooks , which twisted the facts and beautified aggressive warfare , a wave of opposition was stirred up both in Asian nations and within Japan . The Japanese press was somewhat more sensitive in their assessment of the textbook , immediately reporting that the new History Textbook Committee had used the excuse that there was national abuse in the existing middle school history textbooks to lead in writing a prettified history textbook which glorifies an imperialist historical view .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : Party committees and governments should proceed from their specific conditions , properly select the key points of the " strike hard " anti-crime campaign , effectively solve the prominent problems currently existing in the field of public security , and thus guarantee that the broad masses may live safely and peacefully and work happily and guarantee the general tasks of reform , development , and stability .  
It is necessary to actively promote legal administration , to intensify law enforcement inspections , to strengthen law enforcement oversight , to firmly implement the principles of following existing laws , strict law enforcement , and tracking down offenses against the law , to curb waste and destruction of resources , and to effectively improve the ecological environment in order to provide effective guarantees for sustainable economic and social development .  
However , in view of existing weak links in the plant 's quality control work , the Military Representative Office proposed to solemnly deal with the matter in order to strengthen the sense of the quality of military products among intermediate-level leading cadres .  Following careful consideration , the plant 's party committee finally decided to dismiss the director of a branch plant , who was in charge of the production of that product , from his post .  This caused strong repercussions in the whole plant .  
Academician Pan said : With regard to the chronic effect of radiation , on the basis of analyzing and studying large amounts of the existing data , the UN Scientific Committee on the Radiation Effect of Atomic Energy has drawn a conclusion : apart from an increase in thyroid gland cancer observed among children exposed to radiation , no major members of the public have been found to be physically affected in relation to ionizing radiation 14 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident .  
Reportedly , although many proposals on adjusting China 's foreign policy have been sent to Zhongnanhai , as a leadership change at the upcoming 16th party congress is not far away , Jiang Zemin hopes to accomplish the transfer of power in a stable political environment , so the difficult policy issues will be left up to his successor .  Therefore , China will continue to maintain its existing foreign policy for the time being , and will continue to behave in a manner of " hiding its strength and biding its time " in international affairs .  
The Taiwan leader , however , disregarding the historical fact and the universal demand of the compatriots on both sides of the strait , has fabricated the " 1992 spirit " of " a consensus that is devoid of consensus " and the so-called " setting aside the controversial dialogue and exchange , " in an attempt to negate and change the existing foundation of the two organizations ' talks and to set up a serious roadblock to the cross-strait talks .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
She hoped that all relevant ministries and state commissions make further effort , guarantee the smooth operation of the existing work mechanisms , and further strengthen cooperation among the customs , financial , monetary , taxation , and quality inspection departments , continue to implement the current supportive and encouraging policies and measures , and ensure the smooth development of the work of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Third , we should tighten the efforts in compiling the needed teaching materials , and work as quickly as possible to come up with well-compiled teaching materials suitable for different types of cadres to study .  We should make earnest efforts to address the existing problems found in our teaching materials - - such problems as they are not systematic or relevant , and they have only " one size that fits all . "  We should tighten centralized planning and set up a scientific and rational system of compiling teaching materials for the training of cadres .  
Premier Zhu Rongji 's visit increased mutual understanding between China and the five countries , promoted bilateral economic and trade cooperation , consolidated and strengthened existing traditional friendly and good-neighborly relations , and expanded China 's influence .  
and expand the scale of exports .  Meanwhile , they should also strive to attract foreign investment by various means ; particularly , they are urged to pay close attention to the building of the soft environment , adopt earnest steps to protect the interests of foreign investors , and devote great efforts to running well existing national-level economic and technological development zones as well as foreign-invested enterprises .  
The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .  
Deepening rural reforms , gaining a good grasp on resolving current prominent issues existing in rural grassroots areas , and protecting and putting the basic interests of the peasants into practice is an important part of educational events on the important ideas of " three represents " that have been launched in various areas .  
In addition , some stress cooperation among the cities in the course of economic globalization in an attempt to " get rid of constraints imposed by states " .  Such a view is as a matter of fact an attempt to break down the existing legal system in various countries , which runs counter to the interests of developing countries and is not conducive to improving habitat conditions in those countries .  
Thus rational and correct command decisions are bound to unleash powerful capability for a belligerent in winning a war with its existing fighting capacity , even under adverse circumstances .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo , who is on an official visit to Germany , held talks with German Economic Minister Werner Mueller here today .  They had an in-depth exchange of views and achieved important consensus on ways to further strengthen and expand relations , especially economic and technological cooperation , between the two countries .  At the same time , they were pleased and satisfied with the fine relations existing between the two countries as well as with the development of those  
Party organizations at all levels and the vast party rank and file and party cadres in the central departments must take the lead in studying and implementing Comrade Jiang Zemin 's recent important instructions on strengthening and improving the party 's style building , make great effort to carry forward the good tradition and style developed by the party over a long period of practice , effectively and properly solve the prominent problems existing in the field of style , and take concrete actions to build a good image for the leading organs among the people .  
As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .  Instead , we should be realistic and prepare the conditions for transforming , improving , and upgrading them and , through prolonged efforts , gradually make them advanced and applicable .  
They should make up their mind to eliminate the predominant problems that are currently existing with their leadership style ; start from issues that are most sensitive to the troops , issues that are of most concerned to the officers and men at the basic level , as well as issues that are most apt to impair the image of leaders ; and establish a sound image of taking the lead in practicing the thinking of " three represents . "  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
Although his visit is unlikely to iron out all existing problems in Sino-US relations , it is believed that through contacts between senior officials of both sides , a platform for equal exchanges can be built for the frank exchange of opinions on issues of common concern .  It is therefore of positive significance .  
The questions set in the polls of the " Ministry of Foreign Affairs " did point out that " the existing system and way of life will be retained . "  However , keeping in mind the fact that Taiwan is an island and its people are afraid of losing their freedom of external connections , they emphasized that " Taiwan will not have any diplomatic power from now on , " which was also intended as a threat .  
Based on this , we need to start from structural reform , reactivate our existing scientific and technological resources , strengthen our market-oriented research and development , vigorously spread the use of new and high technologies as well as applied technologies , step up the transformation of scientific and technological advances , accelerate the industrialization process of new and high technological achievements , and give shape to a number of new and high technological industries that enjoy independent intellectual property rights .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .  
In respect of science , education , and qualified personnel , it is necessary to strengthen compulsory and elementary education , make a breakthrough in developing high-tech projects , import qualified personnel from other regions and , at the same time , train local talented personnel , bringing into full play the initiative of the existing talent .  
When the new measure is implemented , investors , out of the hope of enjoying the huge price difference between the primary and secondary markets , will actively buy existing stocks before a new stock issue to increase their holdings , thereby increasing their rate of winning the stock allotment lot .  
In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
Beijing 's annual average volume of utilizable water resources is about 4.1 billion cubic meters .  Judging from the existing facilities and management level , this does not come up to the requirements for turning Beijing into an international metropolis and a city with first-rate environmental quality .  
Priorities should be given to the construction and development of information infrastructure facilities .  At the time of using existing optical cables to expand basic transmission networks and popularizing basic telecommunications services , the Ministry of Information Industry will exert efforts to develop and use the most advanced communications and information technical findings of the present age ; speed up the pace of building a new generation of high-speed , safe , and reliable public information networks with a nationwide coverage capacity ;  
The basic meaning of " one country , two systems " is that within the PRC , the main body of the state persists in practicing the socialist system , while post - reversion Hong Kong and Macao , and Taiwan - - after this problem has been finally resolved - - are established as SARs and continue to maintain their existing capitalist system .  This is a basic long-term national policy .  
However , we should be clearly aware of the existing problems : Today , an insufficient effective demand and an irrational economic structure still remain predominant problems , no new consumption hot spot is expected in the near future , problems accumulated over the years in the country 's economic life have been exposed in a concentrated way , and there are still many uncertainties in the international market .  All these problems ought to be brought to our close attention .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .

Starting from August 2002 , all government departments have been untied from using services provided by the EMSD Trading Fund and they now have a free choice between using its services and the services of other contractors .

As claims covering the death of or bodily injuries to third parties involve public interests , the existing legislation requires drivers and vehicle owners to take out motor insurance to cover the death of or bodily injuries to the third parties .

The article also stressed that it was categorically wrong to label Taiwan as a center of counterfeiting .  
The complex physical topography of the island also proved beneficial - - as the climate warmed in the post-glacial period the high mountain slopes provided an ideal environment for the more temperate climate species . Therefore , there are still many species of birds found only in more northern regions existing in the high elevation areas of Taiwan .

Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Yet on this occasion Yang was able to put out five such vehicles .

In fact , with reference to existing prenatal diagnostic techniques for genetic disorders , the ROC Department of Health has issued administrative orders warning doctors that conducting fetal gender tests on pregnant women , or performing abortions based on the fetal gender , would make them guilty of malpractice under the Medical Practice Law and the Medical Treatment Law .

Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts .

Even though the hunting way of life practiced by the aboriginal people for centuries is being turned into an economic resource , it need not-and should not-be merely a superficial tourist attraction . Of course the hunting plan can not solve all existing problems , but , says Sasala , aboriginal people do n't always want to be complaining and asking for government help . Nor should they be intimidated by existing laws into readily giving up their traditional way of life . The hunting plan is actually a movement on behalf of all of aboriginal society .  
Just our bad luck to be born at the wrong time ! " But what does fill them with rage and disgust is " intentional bankruptcies " - - when unscrupulous bosses , under the pretense that business is bad , allow factories to go broke , while in secret they have long since arranged to move production overseas or to transfer assets out of the company . Some even close down the existing company and start up under another name to avoid having to pay workers ' retirement bonuses .

Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe .

In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .

" However , the committee members agreed that existing subject divisions were too narrow , and that children mostly studied fragmentary , disjointed knowledge completely divorced from their life experience . Thus " course integration " was an obvious orientation for change .

Whether it was decided to set up a trust fund , to have recourse to the existing international financial institutions , to non-governmental organizations or to bilateral assistance , the key point was to agree on specific measures making it possible to assist States affected by the sanctions .  
a result of the constitutional changes in the Sudan , which had granted total autonomy to the existing 26 federal states , the status of the refugees could be affected if the international community did not adopt urgent measures to provide more support to the States in which the majority of the refugees were concentrated , especially since in many cases they had overloaded the country 's already limited economic capacity .

convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;

There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
The total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons , as an indispensable step towards general and complete disarmament under strict and efficient international control , is the demand of the entire Non-Aligned Movement , to which we fully subscribe . 
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
The Group should aim to recommend to the General Assembly at an early date concrete and specific measures on the basis of existing written and oral proposals on this subject , which , as stated in paragraph 22 of the report , received wide support in the Open-ended Working Group .  
The changes affecting the international economic scene following the crystallization of the concept of economic globalization and the liberalization of trade-mandate corrective measures require that the existing disproportion be corrected , particularly since the behaviour of certain developed countries in trade liberalization is still marked by a selective approach .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .

It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .

Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
This is based on existing data sets and uses two independent variables - general fertility rates and proportion of births that are assisted by a trained person - to predict values for countries with no sound national estimate of maternal mortality .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
The host countries may request the Secretariat of the United Nations , within existing resources , to disseminate information which would be helpful to the diplomatic community in resolving the debt problems , including , inter alia , provisions of relevant international legal instruments and United Nations documents as well as information provided by the host countries on cost of living at a location concerned and relevant provisions of national legislation ;

The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
At the Vienna Conference on human rights , the international community had recognized that human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and had charted a course of action in the field of human rights into the next century ; however , its attention and efforts must be focused on the implementation of all existing human rights instruments , not only so that the perpetrators of human rights violations could be condemned but so that the rule of law should be respected in the future . 
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;

The ideal is complementarity ; as stated in one of the NFAP operating principles , by complementing and reinforcing existing and planned national and international initiatives , NFAPs will contribute to effective , comprehensive and coordinated action .  
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Adopt an enabling legal and regulatory framework based on an enhanced knowledge , understanding and acceptance of existing practices and land delivery mechanisms so as to stimulate partnerships with the private business and community sectors , specifying recognized types of land tenure and prescribing procedures for the regularization of tenure , where needed ;  
Provide accessible , affordable , impartial , prompt and humane local systems of justice by , inter alia , facilitating and strengthening , where appropriate , existing traditional institutions and procedures for the resolution of disputes and conflicts ; ( e bis . )  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .

Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
Under doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions , a global average of one third ( varying by region from one seventh to two thirds ) of the existing global forested area is likely to undergo a change in broad vegetation types , with the most changes occurring in high latitudes and fewer in the tropics .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
Due to tight budgets in developed countries , developing countries and economies in transition , policy makers are showing increasing interest in saving on scarce budgetary resources by launching reviews of existing subsidy regimes .

The Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat organized a meeting of the Expert Group on the Identification of Principles of International Law for Sustainable Development , within the framework established by the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 5 / and Agenda 21 , to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , consider possible classifications of such principles , and assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .  
This is important for a number of reasons already specified , among which may be highlighted the need to advance understanding of what sustainable development means in relationship to international law and the importance of certain " benchmark principles " for guiding the drafting of national legislation , the interpretation of existing law and negotiations of future international law . 
With a view to achieving these aims , it is essential to eliminate duplication and strengthen cooperation between relevant international organizations , in particular UNCTAD , WTO and the International Trade Centre UNCTAD / GATT , in order to conserve scarce resources and make full use of the existing and potential synergies among these organizations .  Among the measures that should be considered is the establishment of a technical assistance fund administered by WTO in order to help LDCs participate actively in WTO .  
The report drew from the deliberations of an Expert Group meeting of legal experts convened by the Division for Sustainable Development in the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat , in its capacity as task manager for chapter 39 , pursuant to the following objectives : to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , to consider possible classifications of such principles , and to assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .

Cuba has not violated the existing international ethical norms on the use of weapons against civil aircraft , nor has it violated any international legal norm or precept related to the safeguarding of international civil aviation , or the Chicago Convention , much less article 3 bis of the 1984 Montreal Protocol , for very concrete and evident reasons :  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .

While it was clearly stated in the draft resolution as presented that the request for additional meeting time for the Committee should be considered by the General Assembly within the overall existing budget framework , the Secretariat was obliged to make a statement on financial implications in view of the current financial situation faced by the Organization , namely , that : " In adopting the programme budget for 1996-1997 , the General Assembly decided that savings of $ 103.9-million were to be achieved in the programme budget during the biennium .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .

In addition , at the local community level around mine-sites , companies are providing enhancement to existing schooling programmes , health-care programmes - both medical and dental , including preventative care programmes and support through provision of social workers and also providing physical infrastructure such as water-wells , schools , health clinics and recreational facilities .  
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .

The requested oral report on the preparation of a plan for the integration of existing information on mineral resource potential collected by the United Nations system , other organizations and Member States , on an ongoing basis so as to develop a global understanding will not be presented due to the lack of necessary resources available to prepare the plan . 
Member States were invited to accord priority to the practical implementation of standards relating to human rights in the administration of justice , to incorporate into their national legislation and practice existing standards in this field , to design realistic and effective mechanisms for the full implementation of those standards , and to provide the necessary administrative and judicial structures for their continuous monitoring .  
The idea of elaborating an international convention on the illicit traffic in children needed to be discussed further , taking due account of existing conventions in that specific area , which already provided a comprehensive legal framework ( for example , the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children , concluded at Geneva on 30 September 1921 , as amended by the Protocol signed at Lake Success , New York , on 12 November 1947 ) .  
In addition to the commitment already reflected in section F of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to promote , within the United Nations system , regular intergovernmental consideration of environment and development issues and effective coordination of the relevant United Nations system components , the Working Group recommended that the existing machinery be improved at the global level by , inter alia :  
However , the Working Group considered that the existing coordinating structures , at least at the international level , were sufficient to ensure the treatment of the atmosphere protection issues in an integrated manner , and the establishment of new intergovernmental bodies could not therefore be justified .  
Prepare a comprehensive report on existing international and regional norms and standards and on ongoing normative and policy efforts at the international level regarding trafficking in women and violence resulting therefrom , and develop options for comprehensive international responses to the issue , including strengthened preventive action against trafficking in women and girls and child prostitution ( DAW / DPCSD , UNESCO , CPCJD , Centre for Human Rights ) .

These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
To meet these challenges , which were exacerbated by budgetary constraints , the Department streamlined its organizational structure , consolidated its resources and established or strengthened existing links with media organizations and other organizations .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
While reluctantly accepting that conditions do not at present exist for achieving the ultimate objective of the settlement plan , namely , a free and fair referendum , I am conscious of the necessity to keep searching for solutions to the impasse in Western Sahara and to build upon the existing achievement of identifying more than 60,000 applicants and meetings between friends and families who had not seen each other for over 20 years .

In the same resolution the General Assembly invited the specialized agencies and United Nations programmes to contribute , within their respective spheres of competence , to the implementation of the Plan of Action ; called upon a wide range of non-governmental organizations and others to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights ; and requested the existing human rights monitoring bodies to place emphasis on the implementation by Member States of their international obligation to promote human rights education .  
The survey and evaluation and the resulting preliminary report shall seek to identify with particularity , at the international , regional and national levels , inter alia , the number and types of human rights educational materials available , existing human rights educational institutes , centres and permanent focal points , national percentages of teachers trained in human rights education , the percentage of schools having adopted human rights curricula at the primary , secondary and post-secondary levels , and number and types of human rights education components in professional training and non-formal education programmes .  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
The Commission had rightly understood that its mandate was not limited to the mere compilation of existing law and had therefore undertaken an ongoing process of innovation , renewal and modernization of prevailing norms within the framework of the progressive development of international law .  
Regional cooperation should be encouraged through the development of a common strategic framework for the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies to meet regional needs , including the networking of existing and planned national and regional centres of excellence .  
On the other hand , it has been strongly emphasized that the establishment of networks of existing small scientific facilities should also be high on the agenda for strengthening international cooperation , particularly in geomagnetic studies , electrojet current measurements , solar photometry , astrometry , galactic mapping and optical astronomy .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impacts of industrial development , fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened ; the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated ; while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The main objectives of the Andean Community are to promote the balanced and harmonious development of the member countries on an equal basis through integration and economic and social cooperation ; to accelerate economic and social growth and generate employment ; to reduce vulnerability to external factors and to improve the position of member countries in the global economic context ; and to strengthen subregional solidarity and reduce differences in existing levels of development among its members .  
Countries with limited mineral resources , like Armenia , will continue to view the International Atomic Energy Agency as the central medium for the safeguarded transfer of nuclear technology , operational expertise , and technical assistance to countries which explicitly adhere to international non-proliferation objectives and comply with the existing regulations .  
A quick review of its recent report transmitted to the General Assembly indicates that the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories expressed its grave concern at the existing human rights situation in the occupied territories as a result of the settlerist policy pursued by the current Israeli Government . 
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
In most developing countries , the formal sector is incapable of providing a sufficient number of jobs to meet existing and future projected requirements .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
After a three-year assessment period , countries for which existing debt-reduction mechanisms are considered insufficient for achieving sustainability would receive debt reduction of up to 90 per cent on eligible debt by Paris Club creditors , comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors , and reduction of claims by multilateral creditors .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
The Begeer report assumed that the existing international statistical system , which is decentralized in both the subject and regional dimensions , would continue unchanged , an assumption that is critical to its recommendations .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
Member States are also urged to rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as useful tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles ;  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
The Assembly , in the same section of that resolution , stressed that the special session should " be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation . . . , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 [ 1 ] and other relevant conventions and international instruments " . 
JUNIC agreed on the need to develop a joint message of the United Nations with global appeal , to be based on a critical analysis of both the positive and negative feedback from the recent coverage and public debate about the role and achievements of the Organization , and to consider a methodology of media outreach that would successfully counter the effects of the existing information overload .  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation ,  
Among the key recommendations incorporated as a result of the evaluation were : networking among existing regional institutions rather than building new ones ; forming steering committees comprising focal points to manage projects ; and revitalizing the use of intergovernmental meetings as the best mechanism for approving important regional initiatives .  50 .  Another important initiative was the RBAS Quarterly Brief .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
However , while recognizing the important potential in innovative financial packages and new types of public-private partnerships , the Panel emphasized the continuing importance of international public finance and of existing commitments to it , and the need to promote the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
The Panel agreed that forest-related international , regional and bilateral agencies and organizations , existing legal instruments , financial and trade institutions and treaty bodies should mobilize their respective strengths and capacities in implementing the proposals for action in the Panel 's report , and should further promote policy dialogue , consensus-building and international cooperation , recalling Agenda 21 and paragraph 10 of the Forest Principles .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
While existing rules prepared by organizations such as the Comit maritime international ( CMI ) could provide detailed guidance on the use of electronic messages to create bills of lading , they could not provide a legal basis for such bills since the rules were voluntary .  
This has arisen from our understanding of the mandate of the Rapporteurs as derived from the enabling resolutions , the standard terms of reference for fact-finding missions of special rapporteurs / representatives of the Commission on Human Rights , existing practice and the emerging human rights jurisprudence governing similar missions .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
The most desirable alternative would be to maintain the previously existing advantageous parking arrangements for diplomats performing their official duties , and to give them the appropriate legal and organizational status , for example by making the necessary additions to local legislative or other texts and issuing for diplomats ' vehicles special parking permits along the lines of those issued to State and City officials in New York .  
Mr . van Boven was requested to submit , without financial implications , in time for the Sub _ Commission 's consideration at its forty _ eighth session , a revised set of proposed basic principles and guidelines on remedies in the light of existing relevant international instruments , taking into account the new comments received from States and intergovernmental organizations and non _ governmental organizations , as well as the relevant sections of the report of the working group on the administration of justice and the question of compensation .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .  The Sub-Commission should look into the possibility of establishing an international trust fund for the rehabilitation of the survivors of population transfer .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
The promotion and maintenance of the child 's health through strengthened safe motherhood ; breastfeeding , and improved weaning ; universal immunization ; control of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections ; and other existing public health programmes . 
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Consider the feasibility of establishing an international fund to support activities for sustainable forest management ; and explore innovative ways both to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and to generate new and additional public and private financial resources ;  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
The fact that an unwarranted number of Arab dwellings had been declared illegal and been demolished by the Israeli authorities while , on the other hand , there appeared to be a de facto policy of encouraging the expansion of existing settlements and the creation of new ones had provoked a justifiable feeling of grievance .  
In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .  
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
One level involves selective bilateral / trilateral free trade and integration agreements between interested countries outside the framework of existing subregional / regional integration groupings , mirroring the economic growth zone phenomenon in South-East Asia .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Nuclear testing is continuing using non-explosive techniques ; existing weapons are being improved ; new types of weapons are being designed : all indications that CTBT is set to start a new technology race in the quest for more innovative and more lethal nuclear weapons .  
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
As regards prevention , the CIS countries are encouraged to ratify and implement relevant international instruments , make use of the existing procedures and mechanisms established by international bodies and establish national institutions responsible for monitoring and promoting the protection of human rights .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
Stresses that the special session should be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies - in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
The Commission considers that the work undertaken by the UNCTAD secretariat in demonstrating to international private investors that micro finance represents an important potential market for investment , and UNCTADs efforts in creating and enhancing awareness among member States of the enabling environment for micro finance institutions , should be pursued in close cooperation with the competent bodies of the United Nations and other international organizations in this field , including existing national initiatives .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
The system would complement the existing spatial high-resolution capabilities of the SPOT satellite series , providing simultaneous spectral measurements in the visible and short-wave infrared domain of the electromagnetic spectrum .  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
In paragraph 6 , the General Assembly requested JIU to seek a more reader - friendly and uniform format of reports , taking into account new publishing technologies , which would include sections containing the objectives of the report , an executive summary , the conclusions drawn and , as appropriate , the action required to be taken by the organizations , in order to make reports as concise as possible and to comply with the existing page limit of 32 pages .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment in order to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impact of industrial development ; fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions , both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings , but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
Through our Madrid joint statement , by which we stand , it has been put to our neighbour to respect the existing overall framework of international law and treaties that has defined our borders and relations and has stood unchallenged for the last 70 years , and to desist from aggressive policies , refrain from territorial claims and submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice any argument it might deem valid concerning the islet of Imia .  
Lessons learned from Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina prove that the existing international and regional organizations possess tools that are efficient for preventive and post-conflict engagement , on the condition that they are applied in a concerted , timely and proper manner .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
Regarding existing disputes , it is our view that they should be settled through peaceful negotiations in a spirit of equality , mutual understanding and respect for each other 's sovereignty and jurisdiction over respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones , in accordance with international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
The statement , portrayed as an analytical discussion of the critical situation in that part of the world , was drafted and delivered to distort the existing bitter realities in the Middle East and the alarming status quo created solely as a result of the unlawful policies and infamous practices of the Israeli regime in that volatile region .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
Given that existing global stocks of nuclear arsenals number over 30,000 , with the equivalent explosive force of 200,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs , it is imperative that the international community press on , with unremitting vigour , with the global campaign for a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 295 of 24 July 1996 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996 / 111 of 23 April 1996 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 40 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission 's fifty _ third session .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Yet , one might assume that at least in part it is the result of more stringent enforcement of existing and new anti _ racist and anti _ terrorist laws , brought about through joint efforts of Jewish and other national and international organizations and agencies , ranging from the Anti _ Defamation League and the World Jewish Congress to the European Union and the United Nations Human Rights Committee , and from security services to parliaments and juridical associations .  
The disappointing results in the utilization of renewable energy sources are attributable mainly to a lack of information on the economic and technical viability of the technologies in small island developing States , and unaffordable prices of existing technologies , especially solar energy technology .  
Projections regarding future water demand and availability are highly uncertain , being dependent on assumptions about population and economic growth , investment in additional water supply , relative demand from different consuming sectors , the development and adoption of new technologies and the extent to which existing supplies become contaminated .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
The Council also requested the Secretary-General to conduct a survey , on the basis of existing international conventions , analysing the extent to which children were protected from becoming victims of illicit international trafficking , taking into account both substantive and procedural aspects of providing such protection , and to compile and analyse the data collected .  
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Declaration , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and , in that regard , to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates ;  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 10 ] and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein which address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflict , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflict ;  
Invites Governments , in accordance with the commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development held at Copenhagen from 6 to 12 March 1995 , [ 16 ] to set specific target dates for eliminating all forms of child labour which are contrary to accepted international standards , to ensure the full enforcement of relevant existing laws and , where appropriate , to enact the legislation necessary to implement obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child16 and International Labour Organization standards ensuring the protection of working children ;  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The view was expressed that the Commission had rightly understood that its mandate was not limited to the mere compilation of existing law and had therefore undertaken an ongoing process of innovation , renewal and modernization of prevailing norms within the framework of the progressive development of international law .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Given the fact that , on the one hand , legal rules were largely non-existent while existing rules were at times contradictory and , on the other hand , the use of electronic media had gained such overwhelming importance in international trade , it was clear that reliable and binding rules were badly needed .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites the Commission on Sustainable Development , the United Nations Environment Programme and other relevant United Nations bodies , funds and programmes , and the World Tourism Organization , to urgently develop strategies with existing national , regional and subregional tourism organizations in small island developing States to further facilitate sustainable tourism development as an essential element towards an action-oriented international programme of work on sustainable tourism ;  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Finally , Canada expressed the view that the ratification and implementation of existing international instruments represented a first step towards creating a comprehensive and successful legal framework for international cooperation against organized transnational crime .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
According to article III of its Memorandum and Articles of Association , the main objectives of the Centre are to develop well researched policy options on land reform , rural development and agricultural reform to influence the policies of a future administration ; to facilitate the analysis of existing policies and alternative policy proposals relating to this sector ; to provide options for the reorientation of policy-making towards a democratic order ; to collect data and develop and manage a comprehensive information system concerning land and agricultural issues and including all existing research .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;  
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .  
It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
The establishment of a workable and effective system of cooperation between the court and States was of crucial importance for the effectiveness of the court , and the statute should contain explicit provisions on the matter that drew on existing structures and practice in international judicial cooperation .  
My delegation is not convinced that a blueprint or a timetable for the achievement of the ultimate goal in nuclear disarmament would be more conducive to , or for that matter a viable alternative to , the existing bilateral reductions in nuclear arsenals .  
The first was a comprehensive study on the implementation of existing extraterritorial laws enabling States to take legal action against their residents in cases of sexual abuse of children committed abroad .  
Mr . Boris Yeltsin and Mr . Leonid D . Kuchma expressed their support for the continued growth of mutual trade , the harmonization of economic relations , the creation of the necessary conditions for establishing mutually advantageous cooperation between economic agents , the settlement of existing disputes in the area of mutual trade , and the speedy removal of artificial trade barriers .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
Given the extent of violations of the right to a healthy environment , the international community expressed its profound concern , at the 1992 Earth Summit , noting that some international movements of toxic wastes were in contravention of national legislation and existing international instruments , seriously damaging the environment and public health in all countries , particularly the developing ones .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations and regional organizations to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
While the Group of Seven recognized the crucial role played by the United Nations in organizing international cooperation for sustainable development and fostering consensus on development policies and goals , that recognition , though encouraging , would best be expressed through attainment of the agreed ODA targets and implementation of existing agreements and commitments .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
In economic terms , the two main types of efficiency promoted by competition are static efficiency ( optimum utilization of existing resources at least cost ) and dynamic efficiency ( optimal introduction of new products , more efficient production processes and superior organizational structures over time ) .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
Other findings included continued recruitment from a narrow geographical base with apparently no attempt to diversify recruitment sources as prescribed by existing policies , finalization of special service agreements during or even after the consultancy in many cases and high consultancy fees .  
The report dwells on the managerial role played by the existing instruments designed to provide collective guidance and advice to management and considers them to be cumbersome , to cause delays where promptness is required and to dilute responsibility .  
Forum Leaders , recalling their commitment to existing regional and international cooperative security arrangements , accepted the need for the region to take on a more comprehensive approach to regional security consistent with the relevant principles of the United Nations " An Agenda for Peace " .  
Although his previous requests have remained unanswered , the Special Rapporteur is still waiting for the existing Government to carry out an independent , neutral , objective and complete investigation into the exact circumstances of the murder of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 1996 , near Mugina , Cibitoke province , to establish clearly who was responsible , and to publish the results without further delay .  
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
By providing necessary technical inputs and advice from the earliest stages of formulation of programmes and projects , it aims at improving their quality and potential effectiveness , pinpointing areas of omission or overlap and identifying the potential for merging them with existing or planned initiatives by other organizations .  
There is considerable agreement on the conceptual content of the right to adequate food , including relevant health and nutrition aspects , and future efforts in this regard need to be directed primarily at fine-tuning existing concepts .  
Breakdowns in public health as a result of insufficient coverage and the poor operation and maintenance of existing water supply systems are now frequent , though rarely reported until spectacular rates of epidemiological transmission occur .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
Thanks to that integrated approach , the vast national programmes and the regional and international cooperation existing among the members of ASEAN , the peoples of the region had seen a considerable improvement in their quality of life .  
Besides , the provisions of existing law are dispersed in a wide variety of international instruments which make them too diffused and unfocused to be effective in providing adequate protection and assistance for the internally displaced .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
The meeting concluded that a comprehensive report examining the adequacy of observational networks , identifying the existing gaps and quantifying the financial and human resources required , should be prepared for the ninth session of the SBSTA .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
As extra time was needed by Headquarters to coordinate with the missions to make proper preparation of the tender covering their combined requirements , the existing separate contracts were extended , thus postponing the savings .  
Developing the capability to understand and predict the social and economic impact of existing practices ( technological , social , economic and cultural ) that might be detrimental to future generations and national economic / social systems ;  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
The current financial turmoil , coming in the wake of the Mexican crisis , had exposed the inadequacy of existing institutions at the national and international levels , particularly in dealing with short-term capital flows .  
As the most representative of the existing multilateral institutions , the United Nations must be involved in all aspects of a process that had such broad economic , financial , political and social implications .  
The existing constructive nature of the evolution of international relations towards multipolarity is conducive to the creation of a balanced , stable and democratic new world order free from confrontational attitudes .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
One of the major objectives of the camp was to upgrade trainers skills in adapting existing training materials and designing new ones to meet the needs of various target groups in urban and rural areas , with emphasis on the poor .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
The major cost required for the rental of transmission and distribution facilities ( $ 5,948,000 per biennium ) is a recurring cost calculated at commercial prices and as such is not sustainable within existing resources .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
With a view to harmonizing the guidelines with existing forms of remedy , the expert considers it necessary to conduct a systematic review of forms of rights and remedies as they pertain to the mandate , the ways and means of the individual right of access by nationals and aliens before national legal bodies , and finally , the question of international legal consequences for failure to provide substantive redress for such right of procedural access to judicial and administrative bodies .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services . 
Future efforts by international organizations , multilateral institutions and instruments should be flexible in order to accommodate existing and emerging needs , as well as the different levels of social and economic development of countries , in particular developing countries .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
The optional protocol aims to strengthen the existing international standard contained in article 38 of the Convention by raising the minimum age limits for recruitment into armed forces and participation in armed conflict .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
As a result , a considerable proportion of the biological diversity most in need of protection has not been protected ; existing data on the worlds protected areas suggests that evergreen sclerophyllous , temperate and boreal forests are generally poorly represented .  
These could include making appropriate amendments to existing forms of intellectual property rights ; implementing new administrative procedures ( for example , with regard to the patent application process ) ; and using alternative standard forms of legal protection rather than by legislation ( for example , material transfer agreements , biodiversity contracts and licencing agreements ) .  
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
It was pointed out , however , that the obligation to operate a CRL might be appropriate for high-value transactions and certificates ( i.e . , for those enhanced electronic signatures that were intended to produce legal effect ) but would be overly burdensome ( and contrary to existing practice ) if it were to be imposed with respect to all certificates ( including cheap certificates used in the context of significant numbers of digital signatures ) .  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Examples of such issues included whether changes of historic realities had caused some existing legal provisions to become irrelevant , whether some instruments and / or mechanisms provided for within the instruments were too cumbersome or confusing and should therefore be improved , and whether some provisions within the instruments were being interpreted and implemented differently by various States parties .  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
With regard to the international agenda , the pro tempore President of MERCOSUR called for due attention to be paid to existing economic , political and strategic commitments , which should be analysed realistically and objectively in the light of potential costs and benefits which may be generated by either multilateral or bilateral negotiations .  
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
These initiatives should run parallel to , and not be regarded as a substitute for , efforts to secure increased ratification and effective implementation of the existing international treaties concerning human rights , including the 1990 Convention on migrants .  
The Commission could urge relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
It should also be emphasized that another of its objectives was to forestall the financial crisis facing the existing social security institutions in the medium term , and thereby ensure that their income would be sufficient to meet their obligations to pensioners and their administrative costs .  
Such assistance can be classified in three general categories : ( i ) those contributing to national capacity-building through the establishment of new electoral institutions or the strengthening of existing capabilities ; ( ii ) those which relate to the human rights aspects of the electoral process ; and ( iii ) those which provide specific , legal , constitutional , logistic or technical advice or various types of electoral equipment and supplies .  
Convinced that the magnitude of current difficulties called for additional measures for resolving the debt problems of the developing countries , Norway had launched a new national strategy which , in addition to supporting and strengthening already existing multilateral schemes , included bilateral debt reduction measures that would be implemented over and above the reductions granted under multilateral operations .  
imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights . 
His delegation was convinced that the final text must meet at least two conditions : it must result in a consistent and well _ organized instrument , which did not duplicate existing international instruments or those under discussion in other forums ; it must be effective , which meant that it must enable States to act effectively against the scourges with which the protocol dealt .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
The alternative approach that was suggested ( i.e . , the inclusion of an open-ended provision describing such financial practices in sufficiently broad terms to cover existing practices and future developments ) was found to be impractical in view of the difficulty of describing a wide range of heterogeneous and rapidly changing practices with sufficient precision .  
In keeping with its basic mandate , resolution 13 ( I ) of 13 February 1946 , the primary activity of the Department should be to assist and rely upon established governmental and non-governmental agencies of information to provide the public with information about the United Nations ; the Department should engage in activities that will supplement the services of existing agencies of information to the extent that these are insufficient to provide adequate information .  
With respect to objective No . 2 , namely to attain greater efficiency in international trade and development , particularly that of developing countries , in accordance with national aims of economic and social development and existing economic structures , such as through ( a ) the creation , encouragement and protection of competition ; ( b ) control of concentration of market power ; ( c ) encouragement of innovation , the results have been mixed during the period under review .  
An exact knowledge of the relevant dispositions and key ideas could therefore facilitate the adoption of new conventions with a holistic approach or make possible a more precise legal interpretation of the existing instruments in tune with the global requirements .  
To this end , the Section will build on existing legal advice and assistance programmes to expand its capacity to facilitate the exchange of relevant information between countries and relevant entities , including through the use of improved modern technology , promote subregional and regional agreements through meetings , memoranda of understanding and by the provision of model agreements , as well as further develop training programmes for judicial and prosecutorial personnel .  
Missions , in response to ad hoc requests from Governments , on electronic data processing and development ; updating of main economic and social databases ; designing and conducting integrated household surveys ; and improving the existing systems of national accounts , related systems and classification requirements ; ( ii ) Group training .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Some countries have included goals and policies based on those adopted at the Summit in national strategies ; others have introduced new approaches to policy development , have renewed or maintained existing institutions or have sought additional external support . 
The entire illegal parallel educational system is organized outside the existing system , contrary to the applicable curricula , so that data regarding the number of schools and pupils are inaccessible .  
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
The 1999 World Survey provides a synoptic and statistical outline of the current economic and social status of women and of some emerging trends in the 12 critical areas of concern of the Platform for Action . 2 Based on existing data , it highlights the areas where visible progress has been achieved , compared to the situation three decades ago . 
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
The induction of lightly armed international civilian security officers and additional local watchmen has further augmented the existing internal security arrangements .  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
In view of the fact that these areas were subject to a slower form of deterioration , it was determined that , rather than add them to the existing garage project , the areas ( north end 2B ) should be designed and bid as a separate project and the benefit of further competitive bidding gained ; ( iv ) Library faade ( $ 250,000 ) .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
There is , therefore , a need for the Council to consider arrangements to allow additional funding through either bilateral or multilateral sources , over and above those made under the programme , still subject to existing financial controls established by relevant decisions of the Council .  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
This will reinforce existing South / South networks and create opportunities for experts to learn from rapid substantive and technological changes in the field of statistics ; strengthen regional capability to produce analytical reports ; improve the ability of national institutions to produce relevant statistics ; and ensure capability to share information and results .  
Using the new UNIDO methodology , a preliminary integrated approach was developed which will address three main priorities : ( a ) contributing to an efficient , stable energy supply by improving the output of existing mini-hydro power plants and exploring alternative energy sources ; ( b ) providing general management training in basic industries and upgrading technical skills in priority sectors ; and ( c ) improving the access of the manufacturing sector to market intelligence services .  
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
In connection with the other 50 per cent , spare parts for existing medical equipment and new medical equipment have been imported , the importation of these items having been adversely affected by the unjust embargo imposed nearly nine years ago , given that they are to be regarded as integral to the diagnostic process . 
In July 1998 , at the request of the territorial Government , the New Zealand State Services Commissioner appointed a New Zealand-based Tokelauan as TPS Commissioner in order to ensure the effective and efficient running of the existing TPS , and to assist Tokelau to develop and implement a new independent public service that will fit within the new house of Tokelau . 
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .

In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly called for reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter that indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories .  
In this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , the focus has been on three parallel approaches : promoting respect for existing international humanitarian law ; promoting the establishment of the International Criminal Court ; and engaging the Security Council in efforts to identify innovative ways in which the Council , acting within its mandate , can strengthen its capacity to ensure the protection of civilians in conflict .  
Promoting measures for the improved protection of endangered aquatic species , fragile ecosystems , habitats and other ecologically sensitive areas , and for the restoration of damaged systems and areas , as well as pursuing the establishment of new specially protected areas and the expansion of existing ones ;  
The Framework stated several explicit goals that this broad range of collaborators should strive to accomplish during the Decade : build national capabilities to mitigate the effects of natural disasters ; develop guidelines and strategies for applying existing knowledge ; foster research to close gaps in knowledge ; disseminate information ; and develop measures to apply technical assistance and technology transfer , demonstration projects , and education and training .  
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
On the basis of a vast amount of documentation , the work of the Working Group and oral testimony , the Special Rapporteur has reached the conclusion that there is an almost unanimous opinion among geographically-dispersed indigenous peoples that existing State mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , are unable to satisfy their aspirations and hopes for redress .  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
He first recommends the establishment within States with a sizeable indigenous population of an entirely new , special jurisdiction to deal exclusively with indigenous issues , independent of existing governmental ( central or otherwise ) structures , although financed by public funds , that will gradually replace the existing bureaucratic / administrative government branches now in charge of those issues .  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
Moreover , States generally do not keep precise , centralized and accessible records and accounts of existing stocks , including ammunition deemed surplus to national requirements , obsolete or unserviceable .  
The Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office is currently analysing the data to identify pilot or other opportunities for common arrangements to be carried out under memoranda of understanding among participating agencies ; identifying existing umbrella-type or joint contracting agreements that may be further utilized and developed under such memoranda ; and proposing for signature a standard inter-agency memorandum of understanding that provides the basis for common procurement arrangements .  
One of our priorities is to provide a better standard of living for citizens , embodied in the context of the population strategy included in the comprehensive national strategy which summarized the population problem in the Sudan into three basic categories : the existing incompatibility of economic growth with that of population growth , declining population characteristics , and the imbalance of population distribution .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
It reports on the ways and means to ensure a better relative balance in the share of technical cooperation activities among the various regions , taking into account their respective needs as well as making maximum use , in the implementation of technical cooperation activities , of existing capacities of developing countries , including local and regional expertise .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
However , even the view that considered unilateral acts conflicting with any norm of general international law as invalid , maintained that unilateral acts designed to bring about a change in existing international law - President Trumans declaration on the continental shelf in 1946 being one example - represented a separate problem that the Special Rapporteur ought perhaps to consider .  
Accordingly , the Working Group had asked Mr . David Weissbrodt and Anti _ Slavery International , in consultation with non _ governmental organizations with an established record in that field , to prepare a comprehensive review of existing treaty and customary law covering all the traditional and contemporary slavery _ related practices and relevant monitoring mechanisms .  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations and regional organization to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non _ Self _ Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
To implement an integrated , global system , especially through international cooperation , to manage natural disaster mitigation , relief and prevention efforts , especially of an international nature , through Earth observation , communications and other space-based services , making maximum use of existing capabilities and filling gaps in worldwide satellite coverage ;  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The Secretariat should note in particular the clear and unambiguous language of paragraphs 3 and 9 of the draft resolution , which emphasized that all future and existing peacekeeping missions should be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and that no peacekeeping mission should be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions .  
His delegation therefore strongly supported the views which had been expressed by the representative of Uganda on the need for equal treatment of peacekeeping missions , particularly those in Africa , and therefore welcomed the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution , which called for equal treatment and adequate resources for all future and existing peacekeeping missions .  
Accelerating current initiatives and [ taking / adopting United States ] additional actions to reduce substantially the debts of [ developing countries , particularly United States would delete ] the heavily indebted low-income countries , [ by speeding up the process , by relaxing the eligibility criteria and by broadening and deepening / improving and enhancing existing measures within the current framework of Japan ] the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative ;  
The main objectives of the initiative were to strengthen mutual confidence and understanding between UNDP and the specialized agencies through annual consultations and improved information exchange ; to work together more effectively in support of national development priorities and Member States goals through joint strategies , research and resource mobilization ; to improve management and achieve economies of scale through pooling of networks and human resources ; and to review existing tools .  
Information and education efforts should be intensified , especially in the context of bilateral or multilateral technical cooperation programmes , with a view to ensuring respect for and proper implementation of certain existing laws which provide sufficient procedural guarantees . 
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
At this critical juncture , the Nagasaki conference considered , inter alia , how to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons capability ; how to improve and strengthen the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime ; the multilateral approach towards nuclear disarmament and the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons ; immediate priorities to avoid accidental nuclear war ; how to promote nuclear disarmament and practical steps to that end ; and national and regional security today .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
In 1998 , intensive training was conducted for over 60 local counterpart teams in the operation and maintenance of existing water systems in the southern sector , and 45 major feeding centres and main distribution points received adequate supplies of clean water .

For this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .  Wei Jianxing emphasized : All the township ( town ) leading cadres across the country should keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
We must regard WTO accession as a fine opportunity to augment , readjust , and perfect China 's existing laws , regulations , and policies related to external economic work , speed up the effort to build and put on a sound basis the legal system of our economic and trade laws , and make full use of the means of law to protect our legitimate interests . 
The speech profoundly points out the existing problems and weak links in educational work , reflects Comrade Jiang Zemin 's great concern and care about education .  Not only the speech has realistic guiding significance on carrying out the Party 's educational policy in an all-round way and carrying forward our country 's education reform and development , but also will create profound historical influence .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
However , we should soberly perceive the existing problems .  Inadequate effective demand and contradictions resulting from the unreasonable economic structure are still very prominent , and no new consumption hot spots are on the horizon .  Problems in our economic life accumulated over the years have all cropped up and the international market still has many uncertain factors - - we should place adequate importance on these problems .

The eastern region has its own favorable conditions , and so do the central and western regions .  Therefore , what counts is how different regions can analyze and study their own favorable conditions in a realistic approach , establish a development strategy that suits each 's local conditions , and give a better rein to the existing superiorities while turning potential superiorities into realistic ones as soon as possible .  
In the economic and trade sphere , we should positively strive to set up the ' Fujian Experimental Zone for Economic Cooperation Across the Straits ' at an early date , continue to run the existing Taiwan-funded enterprises properly , fully exercise the demonstrative role of the Taiwan investment zone , accelerate the construction of the cross-strait agricultural cooperative experimental zone , have a good grasp of the pilot project of direct sea navigation , and positively explore the new path for direct trade across the straits .

Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .

Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
After China accedes to the WTO , our state enterprises will have to directly face acute competitions from the world 's multinational companies ; and the problems of an irrational product mix , a poor product development ability , and a backward management that are currently existing in our state enterprises are expected to manifest themselves in a more evident way .  All this requires us to comprehensively reinforce the management of enterprises ;

In view of the situation in which the amphibious warfare vehicles could not move forward under water and the wheeled canons could not land because of the poor geological conditions , such as sludge , and factors , such as waves , currents , shell craters , and ditches , the regiment made use of its existing bridge of boats equipment and set up a floating landing stage , thus enabling the heavy-duty equipment to reach the beach successfully in a forced landing .  
In order to accelerate the steps towards making a leap in training , we should extract from past " exhibitions " and " briefings " on real technology based on existing computer networks to train the troops , and rely on all training bases ' extensive opening up of simulated training to enable the troops to become familiar with and master information technology and equipment as soon as possible .  At the " pre-reality line " simulating real combat , we should promote informational training .  
As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .

They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
When one lacks a skeptical critical spirit and reveres all existing understanding as the absolute , the road to scientific progress , passing , breaking new ground , and innovation would be blocked .  
With the rapid development in the equipment and technical level of the Chinese armored unit , the new generation of the officers and men of the " heroic " tank unit are aiming for the frontier of the world 's high technology .  They , guided by actual combat requirements and relying on existing equipment potentials , have successfully revamped the Chinese army 's first digital tank .  
The fundamental approach to dealing with all our existing problems , including such economic construction problems as insufficient domestic demand , an irrational industrial structure , and uneven development across the regions and such political problems as the unification of the motherland , lies in accelerated development .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
Chen Shui-bian expressed his belief that the leaders on both sides of the strait have sufficient wisdom and creativity , and are absolutely able to find some " common ground " and consensus acceptable to both sides , so as to jointly handle the issue of " a future one China " based on " existing foundations " .

"  
Since our army 's network and website building is still at such a primary stage as network personnel handling military issues and the majority of our army 's qualified personnel are still of technical support in nature and have yet to extensively develop or apply the existing hardware or software system in terms of functions and in light of operational decision , command , and tactic , faced with the fast advent of information warfare and network warfare , our army should make further efforts to carry out follow-up research ; explore countermeasures ; 
In resolving the existing outstanding problems in rural reform and development and achieving a new flying leap in China 's agriculture and rural economy , it is essential to regard development of the rural economy as the main theme , regard deepening the rural reforms and rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as the motive force , and regard improving the basic living standards of the peasants as the fundamental starting point , and to do a great deal of work in all respects .

Mutual exchanges between Jinmen and Mazu on the one hand and Fujian 's coastal areas on another hand have been going on since a long time ago .  The so-called " mini three links " currently implemented by Taiwan authorities merely transformed such exchanges from " underground " to " the surface . "  Or just as what the Taiwan mass media pointed out , the measure would merely " decriminalize " the existing exchanges and does not have any realistic significance .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .

While making conscientious efforts to run existing social security services well , we will speed up the formation of a social security system that is independent of enterprises and institutions , has diverse sources of funding and a standardized system of support services , and is run and managed by society , in order to guarantee the smooth progress of state-owned enterprise reform and structural adjustment and maintain the basic stability of society .  
In compliance with the trend in history and by giving account to Hong Kong 's situation and interests , the central authorities set forth the important principles of " one country , two systems , " " Hong Kong being governed by local people , " and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong .

Yang stressed that China 's accession to the WTO will have a profound impact on China 's economic and even political and social life and that the existing administrative and management concepts , systems , structures , methods , and means need to be transformed in an in-depth manner .  
The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
This university regarded this project as its key scientific research task , put in several hundred-thousand yuan to carry out research and development , and directly applied several major scientific research findings to transforming the existing weapons .  Through nearly two years of painstaking efforts to do research and to tackle problems , finally , this university successfully fulfilled the artillery digital transformation task , thus effectively enhancing the tactical and technical performances of towed artillery .

He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .

In the 1982 and 1986 revisions to history textbooks , which twisted the facts and beautified aggressive warfare , a wave of opposition was stirred up both in Asian nations and within Japan . The Japanese press was somewhat more sensitive in their assessment of the textbook , immediately reporting that the new History Textbook Committee had used the excuse that there was national abuse in the existing middle school history textbooks to lead in writing a prettified history textbook which glorifies an imperialist historical view .

This caused strong repercussions in the whole plant .  
Academician Pan said : With regard to the chronic effect of radiation , on the basis of analyzing and studying large amounts of the existing data , the UN Scientific Committee on the Radiation Effect of Atomic Energy has drawn a conclusion : apart from an increase in thyroid gland cancer observed among children exposed to radiation , no major members of the public have been found to be physically affected in relation to ionizing radiation 14 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident .  
Reportedly , although many proposals on adjusting China 's foreign policy have been sent to Zhongnanhai , as a leadership change at the upcoming 16th party congress is not far away , Jiang Zemin hopes to accomplish the transfer of power in a stable political environment , so the difficult policy issues will be left up to his successor .  Therefore , China will continue to maintain its existing foreign policy for the time being , and will continue to behave in a manner of " hiding its strength and biding its time " in international affairs .  
The Taiwan leader , however , disregarding the historical fact and the universal demand of the compatriots on both sides of the strait , has fabricated the " 1992 spirit " of " a consensus that is devoid of consensus " and the so-called " setting aside the controversial dialogue and exchange , " in an attempt to negate and change the existing foundation of the two organizations ' talks and to set up a serious roadblock to the cross-strait talks .

Third , we should tighten the efforts in compiling the needed teaching materials , and work as quickly as possible to come up with well-compiled teaching materials suitable for different types of cadres to study .  We should make earnest efforts to address the existing problems found in our teaching materials - - such problems as they are not systematic or relevant , and they have only " one size that fits all .

The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .

Party organizations at all levels and the vast party rank and file and party cadres in the central departments must take the lead in studying and implementing Comrade Jiang Zemin 's recent important instructions on strengthening and improving the party 's style building , make great effort to carry forward the good tradition and style developed by the party over a long period of practice , effectively and properly solve the prominent problems existing in the field of style , and take concrete actions to build a good image for the leading organs among the people .  
As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .  Instead , we should be realistic and prepare the conditions for transforming , improving , and upgrading them and , through prolonged efforts , gradually make them advanced and applicable .  
They should make up their mind to eliminate the predominant problems that are currently existing with their leadership style ; start from issues that are most sensitive to the troops , issues that are of most concerned to the officers and men at the basic level , as well as issues that are most apt to impair the image of leaders ; and establish a sound image of taking the lead in practicing the thinking of " three represents .

On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .

Based on this , we need to start from structural reform , reactivate our existing scientific and technological resources , strengthen our market-oriented research and development , vigorously spread the use of new and high technologies as well as applied technologies , step up the transformation of scientific and technological advances , accelerate the industrialization process of new and high technological achievements , and give shape to a number of new and high technological industries that enjoy independent intellectual property rights .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .

Third , we must work hard to build up a contingent of high-quality community workers ; and while giving full play to the role of existing committee cadres , we should also adopt effective measures to promptly replenish the contingent of community cadres .

In conducting such activities , we must have our eyes on improving the overall quality of the broad masses of rural grass-roots cadres , on solving existing conspicuous problems in rural areas , and on safeguarding and increasing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of peasants .

However , in general , the current level and size of bilateral economic and trade cooperation is still quite limited , and a great potential has yet to be tapped .

the layout of rural medical and health care institutions will be readjusted , with the current layout based on administrative regional division being changed ; all existing medical and health care facilities will be put under unified management in the whole trade ; in the same township , the health care station and the guiding station for family planning can share resources .

It is one of the largest cantilever bridges in the world . The construction method used " travel wagons " moving by segments from both sides of the existing piers to pour concrete with reinforcing steel . The process continued , segment by segment , the whole length of the span until the " wagons " met midway at the hinged connection point . The north and south approaches of the bridge are supported on prestressed concrete girders and cast-in-place concrete piles with spans from 30 to 40 meters .  
He made special efforts to improve diving flashlights . The existing models were big and clumsy , and he wanted both lighter weight and greater utility . He redesigned the lamp at the front of the flashlight so that light could come out the side of the flashlight , and made a detachable red cover for the central portion of the lamp , to change the flashlight into a distress signal .  
Countering this unfavorable impression was a report from an international meeting in West Germany which stated that the Republic of China on Taiwan was a model for all developing countries in its fight against existing counterfeiting groups . Concurrent with this was a feature in the Los Angeles Times which gave high marks to Taiwan in its struggle against the fraudulent counterfeiters . The article also stressed that it was categorically wrong to label Taiwan as a center of counterfeiting .  
The complex physical topography of the island also proved beneficial - - as the climate warmed in the post-glacial period the high mountain slopes provided an ideal environment for the more temperate climate species . Therefore , there are still many species of birds found only in more northern regions existing in the high elevation areas of Taiwan .  
Eventually people strung together some of the popular songs existing in the countryside , blending them in with plots from vernacular fiction and song-texts and inserting a few charming stage steps and movements derived from ch'e-ku and ts'ai-ch'a drama .

Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Yet on this occasion Yang was able to put out five such vehicles . The key is that he improved the existing circuits and the design of the battery capacity meter , thus raising the effectiveness of the cars . These changes included raising the efficiency of electricity use from 27.5% to 45% ; lowering the recharging time to two hours ; and making it possible to precisely measure the battery capacity . These innovations have greatly increased the practicality of the electric vehicle .  
In 1985 , the mission began collaborating with the University of Costa Rica 's experimental station to perform various surveys and cultivation management experiments on more than 80 existing varieties of grape vines .

Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
Sixty years later , opium was being sold in huge quantities , and the tottering Qing dynasty , ruling an increasingly impoverished and decadent populace , could stand it no more : They decided to strictly ban opium , and burned existing stocks .

Even though the hunting way of life practiced by the aboriginal people for centuries is being turned into an economic resource , it need not-and should not-be merely a superficial tourist attraction . Of course the hunting plan can not solve all existing problems , but , says Sasala , aboriginal people do n't always want to be complaining and asking for government help .

Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe .

Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees . Even if high-quality products are raised , in light of the multiple layers of exploitation existing throughout the sales system and the dumping of low-priced products on the market , farmers are frequently unable to earn a profit .  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .

On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
Under doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions , a global average of one third ( varying by region from one seventh to two thirds ) of the existing global forested area is likely to undergo a change in broad vegetation types , with the most changes occurring in high latitudes and fewer in the tropics .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .

All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .

In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .  
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
One level involves selective bilateral / trilateral free trade and integration agreements between interested countries outside the framework of existing subregional / regional integration groupings , mirroring the economic growth zone phenomenon in South-East Asia .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Nuclear testing is continuing using non-explosive techniques ; existing weapons are being improved ; new types of weapons are being designed : all indications that CTBT is set to start a new technology race in the quest for more innovative and more lethal nuclear weapons .  
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
As regards prevention , the CIS countries are encouraged to ratify and implement relevant international instruments , make use of the existing procedures and mechanisms established by international bodies and establish national institutions responsible for monitoring and promoting the protection of human rights .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
Stresses that the special session should be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
It advocated that the scale should be based on gross national product , with a statistical base period of three years ; and that external debt relief should be based on actual debt flows ; and that the existing formula for the low per capita income adjustment should be retained .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies - in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
The Commission considers that the work undertaken by the UNCTAD secretariat in demonstrating to international private investors that micro finance represents an important potential market for investment , and UNCTADs efforts in creating and enhancing awareness among member States of the enabling environment for micro finance institutions , should be pursued in close cooperation with the competent bodies of the United Nations and other international organizations in this field , including existing national initiatives .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
The system would complement the existing spatial high-resolution capabilities of the SPOT satellite series , providing simultaneous spectral measurements in the visible and short-wave infrared domain of the electromagnetic spectrum .  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
In paragraph 6 , the General Assembly requested JIU to seek a more reader - friendly and uniform format of reports , taking into account new publishing technologies , which would include sections containing the objectives of the report , an executive summary , the conclusions drawn and , as appropriate , the action required to be taken by the organizations , in order to make reports as concise as possible and to comply with the existing page limit of 32 pages .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment in order to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impact of industrial development ; fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions , both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings , but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
Through our Madrid joint statement , by which we stand , it has been put to our neighbour to respect the existing overall framework of international law and treaties that has defined our borders and relations and has stood unchallenged for the last 70 years , and to desist from aggressive policies , refrain from territorial claims and submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice any argument it might deem valid concerning the islet of Imia .  
Lessons learned from Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina prove that the existing international and regional organizations possess tools that are efficient for preventive and post-conflict engagement , on the condition that they are applied in a concerted , timely and proper manner .  
Despite doubts expressed at the session concerning its non-binding character , an international code of ethics for dealers , together with such existing codes for some dealers ' associations , could serve as a tool in the future in drawing a distinction between the licit and illicit trade in cultural objects and will provide guidance for transactions in ambiguous situations .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
Regarding existing disputes , it is our view that they should be settled through peaceful negotiations in a spirit of equality , mutual understanding and respect for each other 's sovereignty and jurisdiction over respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones , in accordance with international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
The statement , portrayed as an analytical discussion of the critical situation in that part of the world , was drafted and delivered to distort the existing bitter realities in the Middle East and the alarming status quo created solely as a result of the unlawful policies and infamous practices of the Israeli regime in that volatile region .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
Given that existing global stocks of nuclear arsenals number over 30,000 , with the equivalent explosive force of 200,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs , it is imperative that the international community press on , with unremitting vigour , with the global campaign for a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
The Secretary-General , in his report of 26 June 1997 to the tenth emergency special session , informed Member States that Israel had not abandoned its construction of the new Israeli settlements at Jebel Abu Ghneim and that settlement activity including the expansion of existing settlements , the construction of bypass roads , the confiscation of lands adjacent to settlements and related activities continued unabated throughout the occupied territories , in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 295 of 24 July 1996 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996 / 111 of 23 April 1996 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 40 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission 's fifty _ third session .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
In resolution 34 / 175 , entitled " Effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights " , the Assembly urged the appropriate United Nations bodies , within their mandates , particularly the Commission , to take timely and effective action in existing and future cases of mass and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Yet , one might assume that at least in part it is the result of more stringent enforcement of existing and new anti _ racist and anti _ terrorist laws , brought about through joint efforts of Jewish and other national and international organizations and agencies , ranging from the Anti _ Defamation League and the World Jewish Congress to the European Union and the United Nations Human Rights Committee , and from security services to parliaments and juridical associations .  
The disappointing results in the utilization of renewable energy sources are attributable mainly to a lack of information on the economic and technical viability of the technologies in small island developing States , and unaffordable prices of existing technologies , especially solar energy technology .  
Projections regarding future water demand and availability are highly uncertain , being dependent on assumptions about population and economic growth , investment in additional water supply , relative demand from different consuming sectors , the development and adoption of new technologies and the extent to which existing supplies become contaminated .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
The Council also requested the Secretary-General to conduct a survey , on the basis of existing international conventions , analysing the extent to which children were protected from becoming victims of illicit international trafficking , taking into account both substantive and procedural aspects of providing such protection , and to compile and analyse the data collected .  
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Declaration , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and , in that regard , to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates ;  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 10 ] and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein which address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflict , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflict ;  
Invites Governments , in accordance with the commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development held at Copenhagen from 6 to 12 March 1995 , [ 16 ] to set specific target dates for eliminating all forms of child labour which are contrary to accepted international standards , to ensure the full enforcement of relevant existing laws and , where appropriate , to enact the legislation necessary to implement obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child16 and International Labour Organization standards ensuring the protection of working children ;  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The view was expressed that the Commission had rightly understood that its mandate was not limited to the mere compilation of existing law and had therefore undertaken an ongoing process of innovation , renewal and modernization of prevailing norms within the framework of the progressive development of international law .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Given the fact that , on the one hand , legal rules were largely non-existent while existing rules were at times contradictory and , on the other hand , the use of electronic media had gained such overwhelming importance in international trade , it was clear that reliable and binding rules were badly needed .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites the Commission on Sustainable Development , the United Nations Environment Programme and other relevant United Nations bodies , funds and programmes , and the World Tourism Organization , to urgently develop strategies with existing national , regional and subregional tourism organizations in small island developing States to further facilitate sustainable tourism development as an essential element towards an action-oriented international programme of work on sustainable tourism ;  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Finally , Canada expressed the view that the ratification and implementation of existing international instruments represented a first step towards creating a comprehensive and successful legal framework for international cooperation against organized transnational crime .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
According to article III of its Memorandum and Articles of Association , the main objectives of the Centre are to develop well researched policy options on land reform , rural development and agricultural reform to influence the policies of a future administration ; to facilitate the analysis of existing policies and alternative policy proposals relating to this sector ; to provide options for the reorientation of policy-making towards a democratic order ; to collect data and develop and manage a comprehensive information system concerning land and agricultural issues and including all existing research .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;  
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .  
It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
The establishment of a workable and effective system of cooperation between the court and States was of crucial importance for the effectiveness of the court , and the statute should contain explicit provisions on the matter that drew on existing structures and practice in international judicial cooperation .  
My delegation is not convinced that a blueprint or a timetable for the achievement of the ultimate goal in nuclear disarmament would be more conducive to , or for that matter a viable alternative to , the existing bilateral reductions in nuclear arsenals .  
The first was a comprehensive study on the implementation of existing extraterritorial laws enabling States to take legal action against their residents in cases of sexual abuse of children committed abroad .  
Mr . Boris Yeltsin and Mr . Leonid D . Kuchma expressed their support for the continued growth of mutual trade , the harmonization of economic relations , the creation of the necessary conditions for establishing mutually advantageous cooperation between economic agents , the settlement of existing disputes in the area of mutual trade , and the speedy removal of artificial trade barriers .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
Given the extent of violations of the right to a healthy environment , the international community expressed its profound concern , at the 1992 Earth Summit , noting that some international movements of toxic wastes were in contravention of national legislation and existing international instruments , seriously damaging the environment and public health in all countries , particularly the developing ones .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations and regional organizations to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
While the Group of Seven recognized the crucial role played by the United Nations in organizing international cooperation for sustainable development and fostering consensus on development policies and goals , that recognition , though encouraging , would best be expressed through attainment of the agreed ODA targets and implementation of existing agreements and commitments .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
In economic terms , the two main types of efficiency promoted by competition are static efficiency ( optimum utilization of existing resources at least cost ) and dynamic efficiency ( optimal introduction of new products , more efficient production processes and superior organizational structures over time ) .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
Other findings included continued recruitment from a narrow geographical base with apparently no attempt to diversify recruitment sources as prescribed by existing policies , finalization of special service agreements during or even after the consultancy in many cases and high consultancy fees .  
The report dwells on the managerial role played by the existing instruments designed to provide collective guidance and advice to management and considers them to be cumbersome , to cause delays where promptness is required and to dilute responsibility .  
Forum Leaders , recalling their commitment to existing regional and international cooperative security arrangements , accepted the need for the region to take on a more comprehensive approach to regional security consistent with the relevant principles of the United Nations " An Agenda for Peace " .  
Although his previous requests have remained unanswered , the Special Rapporteur is still waiting for the existing Government to carry out an independent , neutral , objective and complete investigation into the exact circumstances of the murder of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 1996 , near Mugina , Cibitoke province , to establish clearly who was responsible , and to publish the results without further delay .  
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
By providing necessary technical inputs and advice from the earliest stages of formulation of programmes and projects , it aims at improving their quality and potential effectiveness , pinpointing areas of omission or overlap and identifying the potential for merging them with existing or planned initiatives by other organizations .  
There is considerable agreement on the conceptual content of the right to adequate food , including relevant health and nutrition aspects , and future efforts in this regard need to be directed primarily at fine-tuning existing concepts .  
Breakdowns in public health as a result of insufficient coverage and the poor operation and maintenance of existing water supply systems are now frequent , though rarely reported until spectacular rates of epidemiological transmission occur .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
Thanks to that integrated approach , the vast national programmes and the regional and international cooperation existing among the members of ASEAN , the peoples of the region had seen a considerable improvement in their quality of life .  
Besides , the provisions of existing law are dispersed in a wide variety of international instruments which make them too diffused and unfocused to be effective in providing adequate protection and assistance for the internally displaced .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
The meeting concluded that a comprehensive report examining the adequacy of observational networks , identifying the existing gaps and quantifying the financial and human resources required , should be prepared for the ninth session of the SBSTA .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
As extra time was needed by Headquarters to coordinate with the missions to make proper preparation of the tender covering their combined requirements , the existing separate contracts were extended , thus postponing the savings .  
Developing the capability to understand and predict the social and economic impact of existing practices ( technological , social , economic and cultural ) that might be detrimental to future generations and national economic / social systems ;  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
The current financial turmoil , coming in the wake of the Mexican crisis , had exposed the inadequacy of existing institutions at the national and international levels , particularly in dealing with short-term capital flows .  
As the most representative of the existing multilateral institutions , the United Nations must be involved in all aspects of a process that had such broad economic , financial , political and social implications .  
The existing constructive nature of the evolution of international relations towards multipolarity is conducive to the creation of a balanced , stable and democratic new world order free from confrontational attitudes .  
The existing system , which divided expenditures among the four groups , should be institutionalized , and the special scale for peacekeeping operations should be retained , according to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility .  
One of the major objectives of the camp was to upgrade trainers skills in adapting existing training materials and designing new ones to meet the needs of various target groups in urban and rural areas , with emphasis on the poor .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
The major cost required for the rental of transmission and distribution facilities ( $ 5,948,000 per biennium ) is a recurring cost calculated at commercial prices and as such is not sustainable within existing resources .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
With a view to harmonizing the guidelines with existing forms of remedy , the expert considers it necessary to conduct a systematic review of forms of rights and remedies as they pertain to the mandate , the ways and means of the individual right of access by nationals and aliens before national legal bodies , and finally , the question of international legal consequences for failure to provide substantive redress for such right of procedural access to judicial and administrative bodies .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services . 
Future efforts by international organizations , multilateral institutions and instruments should be flexible in order to accommodate existing and emerging needs , as well as the different levels of social and economic development of countries , in particular developing countries .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
The optional protocol aims to strengthen the existing international standard contained in article 38 of the Convention by raising the minimum age limits for recruitment into armed forces and participation in armed conflict .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
As a result , a considerable proportion of the biological diversity most in need of protection has not been protected ; existing data on the worlds protected areas suggests that evergreen sclerophyllous , temperate and boreal forests are generally poorly represented .  
These could include making appropriate amendments to existing forms of intellectual property rights ; implementing new administrative procedures ( for example , with regard to the patent application process ) ; and using alternative standard forms of legal protection rather than by legislation ( for example , material transfer agreements , biodiversity contracts and licencing agreements ) .  
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
It was pointed out , however , that the obligation to operate a CRL might be appropriate for high-value transactions and certificates ( i.e . , for those enhanced electronic signatures that were intended to produce legal effect ) but would be overly burdensome ( and contrary to existing practice ) if it were to be imposed with respect to all certificates ( including cheap certificates used in the context of significant numbers of digital signatures ) .  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Examples of such issues included whether changes of historic realities had caused some existing legal provisions to become irrelevant , whether some instruments and / or mechanisms provided for within the instruments were too cumbersome or confusing and should therefore be improved , and whether some provisions within the instruments were being interpreted and implemented differently by various States parties .  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
With regard to the international agenda , the pro tempore President of MERCOSUR called for due attention to be paid to existing economic , political and strategic commitments , which should be analysed realistically and objectively in the light of potential costs and benefits which may be generated by either multilateral or bilateral negotiations .  
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
These initiatives should run parallel to , and not be regarded as a substitute for , efforts to secure increased ratification and effective implementation of the existing international treaties concerning human rights , including the 1990 Convention on migrants .  
The Commission could urge relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
It should also be emphasized that another of its objectives was to forestall the financial crisis facing the existing social security institutions in the medium term , and thereby ensure that their income would be sufficient to meet their obligations to pensioners and their administrative costs .  
Such assistance can be classified in three general categories : ( i ) those contributing to national capacity-building through the establishment of new electoral institutions or the strengthening of existing capabilities ; ( ii ) those which relate to the human rights aspects of the electoral process ; and ( iii ) those which provide specific , legal , constitutional , logistic or technical advice or various types of electoral equipment and supplies .  
Convinced that the magnitude of current difficulties called for additional measures for resolving the debt problems of the developing countries , Norway had launched a new national strategy which , in addition to supporting and strengthening already existing multilateral schemes , included bilateral debt reduction measures that would be implemented over and above the reductions granted under multilateral operations .  
imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights . 
His delegation was convinced that the final text must meet at least two conditions : it must result in a consistent and well _ organized instrument , which did not duplicate existing international instruments or those under discussion in other forums ; it must be effective , which meant that it must enable States to act effectively against the scourges with which the protocol dealt .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
The alternative approach that was suggested ( i.e . , the inclusion of an open-ended provision describing such financial practices in sufficiently broad terms to cover existing practices and future developments ) was found to be impractical in view of the difficulty of describing a wide range of heterogeneous and rapidly changing practices with sufficient precision .  
In keeping with its basic mandate , resolution 13 ( I ) of 13 February 1946 , the primary activity of the Department should be to assist and rely upon established governmental and non-governmental agencies of information to provide the public with information about the United Nations ; the Department should engage in activities that will supplement the services of existing agencies of information to the extent that these are insufficient to provide adequate information .  
With respect to objective No . 2 , namely to attain greater efficiency in international trade and development , particularly that of developing countries , in accordance with national aims of economic and social development and existing economic structures , such as through ( a ) the creation , encouragement and protection of competition ; ( b ) control of concentration of market power ; ( c ) encouragement of innovation , the results have been mixed during the period under review .  
An exact knowledge of the relevant dispositions and key ideas could therefore facilitate the adoption of new conventions with a holistic approach or make possible a more precise legal interpretation of the existing instruments in tune with the global requirements .  
To this end , the Section will build on existing legal advice and assistance programmes to expand its capacity to facilitate the exchange of relevant information between countries and relevant entities , including through the use of improved modern technology , promote subregional and regional agreements through meetings , memoranda of understanding and by the provision of model agreements , as well as further develop training programmes for judicial and prosecutorial personnel .  
Missions , in response to ad hoc requests from Governments , on electronic data processing and development ; updating of main economic and social databases ; designing and conducting integrated household surveys ; and improving the existing systems of national accounts , related systems and classification requirements ; ( ii ) Group training .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Some countries have included goals and policies based on those adopted at the Summit in national strategies ; others have introduced new approaches to policy development , have renewed or maintained existing institutions or have sought additional external support . 
The entire illegal parallel educational system is organized outside the existing system , contrary to the applicable curricula , so that data regarding the number of schools and pupils are inaccessible .  
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;

The 1999 World Survey provides a synoptic and statistical outline of the current economic and social status of women and of some emerging trends in the 12 critical areas of concern of the Platform for Action . 2 Based on existing data , it highlights the areas where visible progress has been achieved , compared to the situation three decades ago . 
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
The induction of lightly armed international civilian security officers and additional local watchmen has further augmented the existing internal security arrangements .  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
In view of the fact that these areas were subject to a slower form of deterioration , it was determined that , rather than add them to the existing garage project , the areas ( north end 2B ) should be designed and bid as a separate project and the benefit of further competitive bidding gained ; ( iv ) Library faade ( $ 250,000 ) .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Invites all Special Rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Commission in the field of economic , social and cultural rights to pay due attention , within the scope of their respective mandates , to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures ;  
The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
There is , therefore , a need for the Council to consider arrangements to allow additional funding through either bilateral or multilateral sources , over and above those made under the programme , still subject to existing financial controls established by relevant decisions of the Council .  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
This will reinforce existing South / South networks and create opportunities for experts to learn from rapid substantive and technological changes in the field of statistics ; strengthen regional capability to produce analytical reports ; improve the ability of national institutions to produce relevant statistics ; and ensure capability to share information and results .  
Using the new UNIDO methodology , a preliminary integrated approach was developed which will address three main priorities : ( a ) contributing to an efficient , stable energy supply by improving the output of existing mini-hydro power plants and exploring alternative energy sources ; ( b ) providing general management training in basic industries and upgrading technical skills in priority sectors ; and ( c ) improving the access of the manufacturing sector to market intelligence services .  
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
In connection with the other 50 per cent , spare parts for existing medical equipment and new medical equipment have been imported , the importation of these items having been adversely affected by the unjust embargo imposed nearly nine years ago , given that they are to be regarded as integral to the diagnostic process . 
In July 1998 , at the request of the territorial Government , the New Zealand State Services Commissioner appointed a New Zealand-based Tokelauan as TPS Commissioner in order to ensure the effective and efficient running of the existing TPS , and to assist Tokelau to develop and implement a new independent public service that will fit within the new house of Tokelau . 
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .

In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly called for reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter that indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories .  
In this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , the focus has been on three parallel approaches : promoting respect for existing international humanitarian law ; promoting the establishment of the International Criminal Court ; and engaging the Security Council in efforts to identify innovative ways in which the Council , acting within its mandate , can strengthen its capacity to ensure the protection of civilians in conflict .  
Promoting measures for the improved protection of endangered aquatic species , fragile ecosystems , habitats and other ecologically sensitive areas , and for the restoration of damaged systems and areas , as well as pursuing the establishment of new specially protected areas and the expansion of existing ones ;  
The Framework stated several explicit goals that this broad range of collaborators should strive to accomplish during the Decade : build national capabilities to mitigate the effects of natural disasters ; develop guidelines and strategies for applying existing knowledge ; foster research to close gaps in knowledge ; disseminate information ; and develop measures to apply technical assistance and technology transfer , demonstration projects , and education and training .  
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
On the basis of a vast amount of documentation , the work of the Working Group and oral testimony , the Special Rapporteur has reached the conclusion that there is an almost unanimous opinion among geographically-dispersed indigenous peoples that existing State mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , are unable to satisfy their aspirations and hopes for redress .  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
He first recommends the establishment within States with a sizeable indigenous population of an entirely new , special jurisdiction to deal exclusively with indigenous issues , independent of existing governmental ( central or otherwise ) structures , although financed by public funds , that will gradually replace the existing bureaucratic / administrative government branches now in charge of those issues .  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
Moreover , States generally do not keep precise , centralized and accessible records and accounts of existing stocks , including ammunition deemed surplus to national requirements , obsolete or unserviceable .  
The Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office is currently analysing the data to identify pilot or other opportunities for common arrangements to be carried out under memoranda of understanding among participating agencies ; identifying existing umbrella-type or joint contracting agreements that may be further utilized and developed under such memoranda ; and proposing for signature a standard inter-agency memorandum of understanding that provides the basis for common procurement arrangements .  
One of our priorities is to provide a better standard of living for citizens , embodied in the context of the population strategy included in the comprehensive national strategy which summarized the population problem in the Sudan into three basic categories : the existing incompatibility of economic growth with that of population growth , declining population characteristics , and the imbalance of population distribution .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
It reports on the ways and means to ensure a better relative balance in the share of technical cooperation activities among the various regions , taking into account their respective needs as well as making maximum use , in the implementation of technical cooperation activities , of existing capacities of developing countries , including local and regional expertise .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
However , even the view that considered unilateral acts conflicting with any norm of general international law as invalid , maintained that unilateral acts designed to bring about a change in existing international law - President Trumans declaration on the continental shelf in 1946 being one example - represented a separate problem that the Special Rapporteur ought perhaps to consider .  
Accordingly , the Working Group had asked Mr . David Weissbrodt and Anti _ Slavery International , in consultation with non _ governmental organizations with an established record in that field , to prepare a comprehensive review of existing treaty and customary law covering all the traditional and contemporary slavery _ related practices and relevant monitoring mechanisms .  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations and regional organization to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non _ Self _ Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
To implement an integrated , global system , especially through international cooperation , to manage natural disaster mitigation , relief and prevention efforts , especially of an international nature , through Earth observation , communications and other space-based services , making maximum use of existing capabilities and filling gaps in worldwide satellite coverage ;  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The Secretariat should note in particular the clear and unambiguous language of paragraphs 3 and 9 of the draft resolution , which emphasized that all future and existing peacekeeping missions should be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and that no peacekeeping mission should be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions .  
His delegation therefore strongly supported the views which had been expressed by the representative of Uganda on the need for equal treatment of peacekeeping missions , particularly those in Africa , and therefore welcomed the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution , which called for equal treatment and adequate resources for all future and existing peacekeeping missions .  
Accelerating current initiatives and [ taking / adopting United States ] additional actions to reduce substantially the debts of [ developing countries , particularly United States would delete ] the heavily indebted low-income countries , [ by speeding up the process , by relaxing the eligibility criteria and by broadening and deepening / improving and enhancing existing measures within the current framework of Japan ] the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative ;  
The main objectives of the initiative were to strengthen mutual confidence and understanding between UNDP and the specialized agencies through annual consultations and improved information exchange ; to work together more effectively in support of national development priorities and Member States goals through joint strategies , research and resource mobilization ; to improve management and achieve economies of scale through pooling of networks and human resources ; and to review existing tools .  
Information and education efforts should be intensified , especially in the context of bilateral or multilateral technical cooperation programmes , with a view to ensuring respect for and proper implementation of certain existing laws which provide sufficient procedural guarantees . 
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .

" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
At this critical juncture , the Nagasaki conference considered , inter alia , how to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons capability ; how to improve and strengthen the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime ; the multilateral approach towards nuclear disarmament and the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons ; immediate priorities to avoid accidental nuclear war ; how to promote nuclear disarmament and practical steps to that end ; and national and regional security today .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .

Other areas of concern to developing countries relate to the proof of sound scientific evidence of their own sanitary and phytosanitary measures , market access restrictions resulting from pests and diseases existing elsewhere in the country concerned ( but not in the region of the exporter ) or , more generally , the potential trade and / or economic impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers applied against their exports .  
The international community and its organizations and , in particular , the Conference on Disarmament , must make genuine endeavours to agree to an international convention on the prohibition of the production and use of depleted uranium for military purposes , and the existing international conventions relating to environmental protection must be strengthened by additional measures to deter parties from failing to respect environmental laws .

The Security Council should make every effort to ensure compliance with the two existing ad hoc tribunals , and , pending what we hope will soon be the establishment of a functioning International Criminal Court , the Council must stand ready to endorse the creation of further interim international arrangements to make it possible those responsible for war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide to be held accountable . 
From the IAEA perspective , the universal application of strengthened safeguards , and effective verification of compliance with agreements to eliminate existing nuclear arsenals , would provide a sound basis for verifying a world free from nuclear weapons .  
The executive bodies of the various nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties constitute concrete examples of existing regional arrangements , but their capabilities need to be augmented and their political role needs to be acknowledged by the international community .  
Of course , evolution of the international situation means that it is appropriate for existing rules of international law to be developed and adapted to prevailing conditions , but this should be done through collective discussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions , not as a fait accompli and not working from scratch : it should be based on valid rules of international law .  
To develop the economic and entrepreneurial cooperation among the member countries and to enhance the existing potential by drawing up and implementing projects of common interest , exploring , to this end , the various forms of bilateral , trilateral and multilateral cooperation ;  
The only solution to this dilemma , therefore , is to further develop the existing United Nations system in such a way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time in cases of very grave human rights violations , but not until all means of settling conflicts peacefully have been exhausted and this is a crucial point within a strictly limited legal and controlled framework .

The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .

Mr . Rao ( Observer for the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) ) said that the objectives of the Decade were close to the nature and functions of WIPO , which was not only the international secretariat for existing treaty bodies relating to intellectual property but was also unique in that it provided direct access to private innovators and industry for the registration of patents , trademarks and industrial designs for the purpose of international recognition .

So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .

Significant regularities observed in countries belonging to each of the really existing systemic families led to a comparative assessment where favourable , and adverse trends were mixed on both sides , making objective economic comparison more difficult ( see table 2 ) .  
Many countries share a common legal definition of what is considered to be an organized criminal group ( for example , a group composed of three or more individuals , driven by the pursuit of profit , suspected of committing or having committed serious criminal offences and existing for a prolonged or indefinite period of time ) .  
The indicators contained in the CCA Indicator Framework are built upon existing indicators accepted by the 21st Century Initiative of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD / DAC ) , [ 20 ] the World Bank and members of the United Nations family , as well as the document of the Administrative Committee on Coordination on basic social services for all and minimum national social data .

We are particularly pleased to note the widely shared view that this optional protocol provides procedures for the enforcement of the human rights of women which are in no way less effective than the procedures available in other human rights instruments ; indeed that its provisions build on those existing instruments and should be interpreted in the light of the rules of procedure and the evolving practice and experience of the other human rights treaty bodies .
