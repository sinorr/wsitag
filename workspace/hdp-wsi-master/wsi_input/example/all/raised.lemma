At this time the autumn farming activities went into a phase of decline , and in the north the weather turned cold .

In terms of texture , the proportions of protein and fiber can be adjusted to produce different sensations . Thus , chicken is relatively coarse , so the substitute is made with a higher proportion of fiber . Fish is more tender , so the protein content is raised .

Legislators or members of the public raised questions touching on issues of education , ideology , national security , and so on .

In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Thus evolved seafood dining in Taiwan , from simple roadside stands by the harbors to specialty shops to the " Warring States Period " pitting high-class restaurants against cheap chain shops against fresh fish street vendors . Meanwhile , because seafood raised in aquaculture ponds or imported from abroad has steadily replaced local seafood caught near the shores of Taiwan , the " most-favored fish " lists-especially for wedding banquet dishes-have seen some radical changes of fortune .  
In the fishing town of Putai in Chiayi County , clams raised in aquaculture ponds-dark gray in color and covered with mud and algae-sell for NT $ 50 per catty .

" But local fish caught in the open ocean like the chouduyu are growing scarce .  
Taiwan is blessed with a number of lavishly gifted film-makers who are committed to their ideals , but the solemnity of whose creations perhaps deters a movie-going public raised on Hollywood and Disney . Their films , however , help serious cinema-goers in Taiwan and around the world to better confront life , and at the same time win international exposure for Taiwan , enabling the island 's more cultured aspect to break through in the face of international political taboos and wrangling .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets .

The DPP does not carry the historical burden of this conflict , and has already relaxed its ideological limitations .

Moreover , there is national financial distress with the government deficit exceeding NT $ 3 trillion .

The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market .

Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees .

The area was once central Taiwan 's main aquacultural center , with all kinds of fish being raised there .

Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness .

Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch .

Legislators or members of the public raised questions touching on issues of education , ideology , national security , and so on .

The principle of recognizing mainland degrees has not changed , and the position of the MAC on this question has never changed .  
Oblivious to the traffic thundering across the Yungfu and Chungcheng bridges , which connect the south side of Taipei City with Taipei County , the ducks forage among the cattails and turn up algae , quite in keeping with their nature .

In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Thus evolved seafood dining in Taiwan , from simple roadside stands by the harbors to specialty shops to the " Warring States Period " pitting high-class restaurants against cheap chain shops against fresh fish street vendors . Meanwhile , because seafood raised in aquaculture ponds or imported from abroad has steadily replaced local seafood caught near the shores of Taiwan , the " most-favored fish " lists-especially for wedding banquet dishes-have seen some radical changes of fortune .

Mrs . Hung , who grew up in Tanshui and runs a seafood restaurant , nostalgically recalls eating chouduyu ( a siganid ) caught at the mouth of the Tanshui River . She says : " Natural chouduyu did n't even need salt , it tasted fragrant and sweet just fried up straight . If you buy chouduyu that was raised in an aquaculture pond , you have to add soy sauce just to cover the smell of the earth . " But local fish caught in the open ocean like the chouduyu are growing scarce .  
Taiwan is blessed with a number of lavishly gifted film-makers who are committed to their ideals , but the solemnity of whose creations perhaps deters a movie-going public raised on Hollywood and Disney . Their films , however , help serious cinema-goers in Taiwan and around the world to better confront life , and at the same time win international exposure for Taiwan , enabling the island 's more cultured aspect to break through in the face of international political taboos and wrangling .
