The " Report " accuses the Chinese Government of adopting legislation to control the Internet , babbling that " the new laws adopted on 26 September 2000 prohibit any material whose content is held to be subverting the state regime , supporting so-called cults , sabotaging reunification with Taiwan , and damaging China 's reputation " ; it also makes the accusation that " special Internet police have been established in about 20 provinces with the aim of removing information with sexual content . "  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
The BA considered that the prolonged close-ups on the sexual characteristic of a woman was exploitative , offensive to the average viewer and denigrating to the female gender .  
Scenarios in which Mr Tsui assists case commanders include serial or bizarre sexual offences or homicide , unexplained arson , threatening or bizarre messages , unexplained deaths requiring psychological autopsy , profiling of missing persons and other unusual crimes and incidents .  
( iv ) Sexual abuse - any act which involves unwanted or forcible touching / activity of a sexual nature or a situation in which an elderly person with physical and mental disabilities submits to sexual activity without consent .  
For example , in the case of the Hospital Authority ( HA ) , there is a set of comprehensive guidelines on management of victims of sexual assaults in its hospitals , including services to be provided by A &amp; amp ; E doctors , as well as coordination in the collection of forensic samples by forensic pathologists and provision of psychological and counselling support by clinical psychologists , psychiatrists and medical social workers . 
" Women have special needs in areas such as physical and mental health , and they face different barriers and difficulties .  These include sexual violence and domestic violence problems , lack of formal education opportunities while they were young , unemployment at middle age , the digital divide , immense pressures faced by working women with dual roles , single parent families lacking sufficient support , as well as difficulties faced by disabled women .  All these lead us to feel that there is a need to empower women , " Ms Kao continued .  
The VCD comprises 12 short episodes , each lasting about three minutes , and features crimes such as triad activities at schools , trafficking in dangerous drugs , selling pirated goods , internet related crimes , common assault , shoplifting , criminal damage , indecent assault and sexual intercourse with underage girl .

Family doctor Tony Shieh says that the most direct way to reduce sexual stimulation is exercise , which lowers seminal vesicle activity , releases energy , and preempts blood from filling up the sex organ . Besides this , a cold shower before bed , light calisthenics , wearing loose-fitting underwear , avoiding a too-warm blanket , and keeping an active lifestyle to tire oneself out are all ways to help overcome excessive sexual desire .  
But this April a case was discovered in which the individual , a homosexual , had never been abroad and had no foreign sexual partners . This case shattered the myth that one was safe by avoiding foreigners and generated a certain panic " in the circle . "  
The former was limited to a few enthusiasts for the transcendent and sublime ; the latter appealed through claims of instant success , guaranteed universal cures and enhanced sexual performance , but its vulgar " packaging " ensured that its influence was only restricted to a narrow field .  
Since we have come to understand more about the Japanese , We have discovered that generally they are embarrassed about beliefs that might sound unscientific . On the other hand , they are quite open and brash about things that Americans consider to be private , such as personal finance and sexual experience - - especially the men .  
According to a study by the Training and Education Commission of the Ministry of Education , behavioral problems in junior and high school , such as running away from home , skipping school , promiscuous sexual behavior and poor interpersonal relationships are all intimately related to family problems , such as parents and children not getting along or parental absence , divorce or an extramarital affair .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
Last year there was a string of incidents of women who murdered their abusive husbands , sexual harassment on college campuses , and rape . Many women reporters were deeply distressed by the superficial " spin " put on these stories by their newspapers , which deliberately treated the stories as " having pornographic overtones " or as cases of " the war between the sexes . " They had to fight hard to get more balanced reports into the papers .  
Looking at the evolution of " sexual affairs " in dynasties down the ages , a regular pattern emerges : the more prosperous and powerful a dynasty was , the less restrictions it placed on people in sexual matters ; while the more weak and corrupt a dynasty was , the more tightly it controlled people 's lives , and the more severe the constraints it placed on sex .  
Lately Taipei has been all abuzz over the " Lu An-ni incident . " Lu , a student who did not pass the examination to enter a doctoral program , accused professors who gave her the oral examination of plagiarism and sexual harassment . The professors responded that they had done nothing of the kind , and that Lu had an ulterior motive for making the charges .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
The Academia Sinica 's Chiao Hsingkai notes that it is often overlooked that both sexual harassment and rape are repeat offenses . If undiscovered , over a long period an offender may repeatedly play his degrading games . As for how he chooses his victims , that is still uncertain . However , it is often the case that the criminal will pick the easiestlooking target : young , unsophisticated , genteel looking girls .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
The unlicensed " underground radio stations " stirred up criticism about public affairs , providing a release for dissatisfaction about society and government . As new radio stations have appeared , they have gone to sensational lengths to attract listeners . On the air , young show hosts talk about sexual topics : incest , gigolos , oral sex .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence . " Family relationships , freedom to choose one 's residence , and equality of the sexes , all of which are protected by the constitution , are interrelated , and among the inalienable rights of an individual , " wrote the China Times in an editorial . " It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
Currently sex education classes-covering things like reproductive biology , sexual values , and the use of sanitary napkins and condoms-are being taught in middle and primary schools across Taiwan . Through education at the roots , children can be helped to keep themselves steady through this period of vast change , and build a sexual value system suited to the 21st century .  
Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
Studies abroad suggest that adult sexual problems such as exposure , fetishes , impotence , or premature ejaculation are all related to repression of sexuality in early childhood . Sufferers of these problems find it impossible to have normal adult sexual relationships , which leads to a terrible loss of happiness over their entire lives .  
Chen Yi-ming points out that male genitalia are less likely to develop sores , and the mucus membranes in female sexual organs have a larger number of monocytes that are receptive to viruses . In addition , seminal fluid contains more viruses than vaginal fluid . For these reasons , women are more easily infected by men than vice versa .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
The book is filled with conflict between old and new values . As Chu explains : " If we take the status of the ' desolate man ' - a homosexual role-as a metaphor , it hints that if a culture has already developed to the point where people do not want to reproduce , to create a next generation , sex becomes elevated to an end in itself , and the natural drive to reproduce becomes expended in sexual consumption , in pursuit of sensual extremes . . . .  
Liao Ching-pi , an associate professor of social work at Soochow University and director of the Yoyuen Social Work Foundation , holds strongly to the newer view . Studies done overseas , says Liao , " show that affairs are most likely to happen with men who are unsuccessful in their careers , suffering from sexual dysfunction , or faced with problems in their family or personal relationships that they ca n't handle . "  
Fortunately , when the integrated nine-year curriculum goes into effect , there will be more time devoted to sex education in junior high and elementary school classrooms . The education will provide the kids with a more complete understanding of sexual issues , including discussions about ethics , behavioral changes , and self-protection . These classes are not just going to focus on sensationalistic aspects of sex .  
Intersexuals ( also known as hermaphrodites ) are people who were born with two sets of sexual organs . They have chromosomal abnormalities or hormonal imbalances and are not transsexuals . People who adopt a persona of the opposite sex for a special reason , such as Mulan ( who took her father 's place in the army ) or the transvestites who change their sex to make a living , can not be counted as true transsexuals .  
In the sexual spectrum , there is a wide range of colors . To divide male and female into two extreme categories of masculine and feminine would make us unable to understand and appreciate disadvantaged groups . "  
For the September edition of Sinorama , your magazine interviewed me on issues related to the protection of human rights for people of diverse sexual orientations ( including homosexuals , bisexuals and transgender people ) . Perhaps for reasons of space , many controversial points were not covered in detail , so I am now writing to give a little further explanation and to again call on people of vision to press the relevant authorities to quickly draft laws to concretely protect the basic human rights of transgender people .  
When art therapy , which uses mental symbols and intuition , is applied to mental illness , sexual abuse , child abuse cases , or to children whose verbal understanding is limited , it is able to gradually lower the patient 's defense mechanisms , build a better relationship between patient and therapist and unearth the old stories that lie buried in the deepest recesses of the subconscious .  
Lin Pen-hsuan , assistant professor at the Institute of Sociology at Nanhua University , reminds us that in this extremely commercialized world , people have moved from viewing the body as taboo , then opening up to an acceptance of it , to seeing that it can be manipulated and played around with . From beauty treatments and body sculpting to sexual promiscuity , the body is often packaged into a variety of discourses and commercial ends . Is there no escape from all of this , even in death ?

Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .

The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Bangladesh welcomed the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action , which embodied practical commitments and priorities for action at the national , regional and international levels for preventing the commercial sexual exploitation of children , and for protecting and reintegrating the children who were its victims . 
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation .

The effects on the mental and psychological health of children subject to commercial sexual exploitation are not easy to diagnose , and can be healed only through expensive and prolonged treatment .

The ill-treatment described included beatings , burning with cigarettes , whippings with rubber or leather straps , sexual assault , being hung upside down for prolonged periods , electric shocks , deprivation of sleep , mock executions , the use of fetters , blindfolding for periods of up to 16 days and public humiliation .

A number of the issues raised in the report deserved to be highlighted , including the need to put a stop to the use of children as soldiers , the introduction of a comprehensive international ban on anti-personnel landmines , and the need in conflict situations to provide humanitarian guarantees for the special reproductive health needs of women and girls and steps to protect women and children from rape and other forms of sexual violence .  
Mr . WILMOT ( Ghana ) , commending the expert of the Secretary-General for her report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , observed that it went beyond the five main issues originally listed in General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 to address other pertinent issues such as rape and other forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation , economic sanctions and measures to ensure the education , health , nutrition and psychological well-being of such children .

Belgium is in favour of the adoption of a binding instrument which , supplementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child , would have the effect of compelling the signatory States to rank practices linked to the sexual exploitation of children as penal offences , so that they can be punished under criminal law .  
Against this background , the preparation of the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child has to be welcomed as a major step forward at the international level in translating many of the recommendations contained in the above _ mentioned Council of Europe text , into binding internatonal norms , thus protecting children more effectively against the various forms of sexual exploitation .  Available for consultation with the Secretariat .  
The term " rape " was not defined , and although it was possible to adapt the term " rape " to sociological realities , that is to say to take account of present-day sexual practices , there was a reluctance to do so ; in most cases the only act characterized as rape was that ultimate violation of the person which is likely to result in pregnancy .  [ 66 ] Oral and anal penetrations forced on a person , whether male or female , were , at most , punishable as indecent assaults .  
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
Also with regard to the United States , the Special Rapporteur wishes to express her particular appreciation of the comprehensive training module developed since 1982 by the Office for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , which is responsible for carrying out law enforcement training programmes on juvenile delinquency .  Since 1983 , training programmes on child abuse and sexual exploitation investigative techniques for local law enforcement officials have also been held nationwide .  
The priorities pursued , which the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse , include a multidisciplinary approach , involving social services and mental health workers , to interviewing and investigation , special treatment in court settings which are child-friendly and appropriate to age and status , and continuing care in order to address the lingering effects of commercial sexual exploitation .  Measures are to be reinforced through education systems which provide children with skills and opportunities as a preventive strategy .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
In light of article 39 of the Convention , the Committee is worried about the insufficient measures taken to provide physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration to children victims of any form of neglect , abuse and / or exploitation , particularly victims of armed conflicts , sexual exploitation and child labour .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children , as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims , held in Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993 , and reiterating that such acts constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;

In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
The Platform for Action defines violence against women as including Physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , including battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry _ related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non _ spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ( para .  113 ) .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
The Member State also noted that the Secretary-Generals report categorized violence into economic exploitation , social / psychological violence , physical / sexual violence and violence resulting from operation of the legal system and pointed out that non-payment or delay in the payment of wages and / or violation of wages agreed to under contract had been highlighted as a common type of economic exploitation in receiving countries . 
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to continue his work to create a gender-sensitive work environment supportive of the needs of his staff , both women and men , including through the development of policies for flexible working time , workplace possibilities , family leave , child-care and elder care needs , as well as through training , particularly at senior levels , and the implementation of all appropriate administrative procedures , in particular the special measures outlined in his report , 2 and through further development of a policy against sexual harassment ;  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;

A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
Article 187 further stipulates that : Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a woman without using force , threats or deception but knowing her to be insane , feeble _ minded , under 15 years of age , incapable of exercising her own free will for any reason , or knowing her to be unaware of the nature or unlawfulness of the act to which she is being subjected , shall be liable to a penalty of life imprisonment .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,

Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
In this connection , the frequent undue delays experienced in court cases involving rape and sexual offences pose a major problem , so that at any given time 200 to 250 cases are pending before G Court , whereas a backlog of 80 cases is normally considered acceptable .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
UNFPA is the lead agency for integration of reproductive health care , which includes sexual health and family planning , maternal and neonatal care , prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections , sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and elimination of harmful practices , including female genital mutilation ( FGM ) and violence against women .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
They were urged to eliminate negative cultural practices and attitudes against girls and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against girls and the root causes of son preference , which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , inter alia , by enacting and enforcing legislation protecting girls from violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse and exploitation . 
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly the most disadvantaged children , including children with disabilities , refugee and internally displaced children , children ill _ treated and abused within the family and in institutions or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation and children who live and / or work on the street .  
The first was a comprehensive study on the implementation of existing extraterritorial laws enabling States to take legal action against their residents in cases of sexual abuse of children committed abroad .  
The Committee noted with satisfaction several measures taken between the third and fourth periodic reports , such as the provision of credit assistance to women , legislation prohibiting sexual harassment , raising the minimum wage for domestic workers and increasing maternity and paternity benefits for employed persons .  
In that declaration , an appeal was made to all family-planning associations and their allies , calling on them to identify problems requiring direct action at national level and asking them to make their respective societies aware of the ills of harmful traditional practices that run counter to the most elementary of sexual and reproductive rights .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
Under common article 3 , rape has also been charged in isolated instances of rape and other instances of sexual assault and sexual mutilation as cruel treatment , an outrage upon human dignity and humiliating and degrading treatment .  
In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
The Supreme Court of Canada has incorporated the gender element in its reinterpretation of social group , describing it as a section of society defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic such as gender , linguistic background or sexual orientation .  
The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the existence of commercial sexual exploitation of children , through loosely organized networks , in rich , private houses known as Mbwa kali , which refers to the Beware of fierce dog signs posted outside the gates .  
The meeting had been devoted to three themes : the creation of a favourable environment for the emancipation of teenage girls ; the special need for social protection of adolescent girls ; and teenage health , including sexual and reproductive health .  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health-care programmes , including in sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
To make information and counselling widely available to adolescent girls and boys , especially on human relationships , reproductive and sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases and adolescent pregnancy , in a manner that is confidential and easily accessible , and to emphasize the equal responsibility of girls and boys ;  
Lastly , it should be noted that there remain principal subjects of concern that have a bearing on economic , social and cultural issues , such as the problem of violence against women in all its aspects , including sexual abuse , physical and mental ill-treatment , sexual exploitation of children and sexual harassment at work , which represent a pattern of human rights violations calling for firm and persistent action at the various levels of the State and within civil society .  
Child pornography means the conception , production , presentation , dissemination , whether or not on commercial basis , visual or audio , that constitute a real or simulated representation of a child engaged or depicted as engaged in sexual activity or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child for promoting or satisfying sexual purposes .  
The definition of visual child pornography was to read as follows : Child pornography is the visual depiction of a child , real or simulated , engaged in explicit sexual activity , or the lewd exhibition of genitals , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material .  
Child pornography means any representation of a [ n actual ] child engaged in [ real or simulated ] explicit sexual activities [ or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child , the dominant characteristic of which is depiction for sexual gratification ] .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
Among such practices were female genital circumcision , which also posed grave health risks for females ; arranged marriages without consent and contracted against personal will ; sexual harassment , which had become widespread ; force-feeding ; and removal of children from their mother at an early age .  
The agreed conclusions of the meeting reaffirmed , inter alia , that universal access to quality , comprehensive and affordable health care , including reproductive and sexual health of women throughout the life cycle , are essential requirements for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;

To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation / measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation / abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree on common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV / AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;

Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes , and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
We recognize , however , that more preventative health and family life education and counselling programmes relevant to the needs of our youth are required to abate the spate of adolescent pregnancy so that the youth of our nation can make positive , responsible choices about sexual activity and be productive , contributing members of society .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Despite these breakthroughs , it is necessary to continue to focus specific attention on adolescents , to examine the problems related to the ageing of the population , to eliminate sexist stereotypes that still persist in our society and that limit full gender equality in sexual and family life , and to work towards increasing preventive and educational actions related to HIV / AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases , so as to foster heightened risk perception in the Cuban population , among others .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
UNHCR has actively worked , at the level of law , to ensure wider acceptance of the notion that persecution may be effected through sexual violence , as well as of the notion that women asylum-seekers who face harsh or inhuman treatment due to their having transgressed the social mores of the society , may be considered as a " particular social group " within the meaning of Article 1 of the 1951 Convention .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
According to the Committee , there was an increasing tendency to recruit women migrant workers for commercial ( sexual ) exploitation through arranged marriages with foreigners or by getting them to sign contracts of employment that look tempting but rarely reflect the real situation .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
The Recommendation enumerates the factors to be taken into account in determining the types of hazardous work , for example , work which exposes children to physical , psychological or sexual abuse ; work underground , or at dangerous heights ; work with dangerous machinery ; and work in an unhealthy environment .  
It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
Based on information gathered , the Prosecutor believes that sexual crimes were planned , systematic and generalized and that they were committed with the active participation of the soldiers , the Interahamwe and government and administrative authorities at both local and national levels .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
The special sessions strong reinforcement of human rights and the human well-being language of the Programme of Action was particularly welcome , as were the calls for intensified action in implementing the Programme of Action , and the new benchmarks in reproductive and sexual health , access to family planning services , reduced maternal mortality , HIV / AIDS prevention , gender issues and education . 
The Government , in cooperation with the private sector , had also sought to provide shelter and rehabilitative services to girls who had been sexually abused , and a national plan of action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children was being developed .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
These grounds are : sex ; marital status ; religious belief ; ethical belief ; colour , race , ethnic or national origin ( which includes nationality or citizenship ) ; disability ; age ; political opinion ; employment status ; family status ; or sexual orientation .  
These included the lack of a systematic data-collection mechanism , inadequacies pertaining to the birth registration system , the continuing use of corporal punishment by parents and teachers , insufficient awareness and lack of information about ill-treatment and abuse , including sexual abuse , both within and outside of the family , as well as insufficient legal protection measures , appropriate resources and adequately trained personnel to prevent and combat such abuse .  
For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
At the same time , they channel the consciousness of governmental organizations and civil society in order to secure innovative , concerted , intersectorial and multisectorial actions designed to permit a satisfactory sexual and reproductive life at the individual , family and social levels in a climate of equity which promotes healthy and whole lifestyles .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
At home and on the international stage , New Zealand has sought to play an active role in the promotion of the human rights of women and to ensure their full participation in society as equal partners with men , in particular supporting and encouraging sexual and reproductive health rights and other rights of women , which are central to the Programme of Action .  
I must stress again the need for an increase in international assistance , which we , as a developing country , need if we are to reduce the death rate from the HIV AIDS pandemic , from infectious or parasitic diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera , and most of all to meet the needs of young men and women for reproductive and sexual health . 
Securing the right to safe motherhood is also emphasized , along with infertility services and comprehensive care for adolescents in order to promote and develop appropriate sexual and reproductive health and the prevention of cervical , uterine and breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men , while continuing with the national plan for prevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV AIDS .  
The significant internal and outward migration for economic reasons of young men particularly to the United States and young women particularly to Europe , especially Spain in recent times ; high rates of maternal mortality ; and the undoubtedly limited sexual and reproductive rights and the rights of women call for specific measures .  
Promoting healthy and responsible behaviour in the sphere of sexual and reproductive health requires profound cultural change , and the Government therefore considers it important to incorporate population issues into curricula at all levels of the national education system .  
We see ourselves as a strong partner with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) and all other organizations of civil society and Governments in this continued , accelerated and adequately resourced implementation of the key actions of the ICPD Programme of Action , one of the twentieth century ' s major contributions to global thinking about the key role of sexual and reproductive health and rights in promoting equity and development . 
While joining this valuable consensus on the final outcome of the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly , on population and development , and supporting its implementation at both national and international levels , I would like to enter our reservation regarding any provision in the text that condones or encourages , explicitly or otherwise , sexual relations outside the framework of marriage and the family , as defined exclusively as the heterosexual union between man and woman .  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
However , much had already been done ( including the review of measures taken to promote gender equality , the establishment of a national centre to combat ethnic discrimination , the development of a national plan of action for disabled persons ) , and Norways labour legislation had recently been amended to make discrimination based on race , colour , nationality , ethnic origin or sexual preference , in the area of employment , a criminal offence .  
Reforms were needed to protect the rights of the child : education must be improved , childrens courts must be reformed , the practice of recruiting minors to the armed forces must be stopped , hazardous child labour must be prohibited , and the sexual exploitation of children ( who were often exposed to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ) must be combated more effectively .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
In addition to the physical injury resulting from the battery , battering during pregnancy can result in premature labour , miscarriages , recurrent vaginal infections , delivery of premature or low _ birth-weight infants with reduced chances for survival , sexual dysfunction , fear of sex , and sexually transmitted diseases .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
On the other hand , blindfolding , the use of hosing with cold water , straight hanging ( suspension by the raised arms from a crossbar ) , rough physical treatment , sexual abuses and threats of rape , the use of grossly insulting language and the making of threats to the life and physical integrity of detainees or their families still seem rife in many parts of the country .  
Development is unsustainable where the rule of law and equity do not exist ; where ethnic , religious or sexual discrimination are rampant ; where there are restrictions on free speech , free association and the media ; or where large numbers of people live in abject and degrading poverty .  
It is also one of the most effective tools to combat intolerance by opening the gateway to messages of mutual respect , enabling them to circulate freely worldwide , and by encouraging collective actions to oppose and bring to an end such phenomena as hate speech , racism and the sexual and commercial exploitation of , in particular , women and children .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes , including son preference , which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection , discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against women , including female genital mutilation , rape , incest , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation . 
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree upon common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
The new text stated not only that discrimination on grounds of race , age , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , sexual orientation , disability or state of health was prohibited , but also that the State would grant special protection to persons who were at a disadvantage for any of those reasons and would punish those responsible for violations committed against such persons .  
An honorary advisory commission on sexual and reproductive health has been formed ; among its other activities , it is studying and formulating standards on medical and ethical problems relating to assisted reproduction .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .

Create permanent national and local working groups that include the participation of Governments , NGOs , womens groups and indigenous peoples to ensure that sexual and reproductive rights are explicitly covered in policies and legal reform .  
She also interpreted any representation , by whatever means , of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities not to be applicable to adults acting , posing or dressing as a child .  
The United States understood the definition to include the visual representation of a child , engaged in real or simulated sexual activities , or of the genitalia of a child where the dominant characteristic was depiction for a sexual purpose .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
These steps may include public education , outreach and media campaigns designed to dispel harmful and demeaning stereotypes about women and men , and to remove the religious , cultural and social stigma often associated with sexual violence .  
The Statute defines the forcible transfer of the children of a threatened national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another group as genocide , while rape and sexual slavery are classified as both war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
In general , protection activities of COHCHR prevented illegal arrests as well as excessive detention , and facilitated victims access to legal assistance , release of victims in illegal detention , release of a significant number of adult women and minor girls from confinement and sexual exploitation , provision of shelter to several foreign victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and the arrangement of their safe and voluntary return to their home countries .  
In October 2000 , the Task Force completed new and / or revised Guidelines for the United Nations Resident Coordinator System in the following areas : adolescent sexual and reproductive health ; basic education with special attention to gender disparities ; maternal mortality reduction ; reproductive health ; and HIV / AIDS . UNFPA is actively involved in the reform initiatives of the Secretary-General , and through the UNDG actively contributed to the preparation of the action strategies on halving extreme poverty and girls education . 
The Committee is similarly concerned by the different minimum legal ages for marriage , the absence of a defined minimum age of sexual consent for boys , the very high minimum age for consulting a doctor without parental consent and the extremely low minimum age of criminal responsibility - currently age seven .  
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .  
In its view , the legal protection designed to counter the problem of the sale and abuse of children should not be confined to sexual exploitation ; it was also necessary to condemn the practices which violated international rules governing such matters as adoption .  
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( A / CONF . 183 / 9 ) , which affirms that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence constitute , in defined circumstances , a crime against humanity and / or a war crime , and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female infanticide , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
Condemns violence against women committed in situations of armed conflict , such as murder , rape , including systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , and calls for effective responses to these violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Calls upon all States to take all appropriate national , bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent all forms of violence against children and to protect them from torture and other forms of violence , physical violence including domestic violence , child abuse , mental and sexual violence , abuse by the police and other law enforcement authorities or by employees in juvenile detention centres , orphanages , child care institutions and others , as well as violence in the street and in schools ;  
Calls upon all States to protect refugee children , unaccompanied children seeking asylum and internally displaced children , who are particularly exposed to risks in connection with armed conflict , such as recruitment , sexual violence and exploitation , to pay particular attention to programmes for voluntary repatriation , and wherever possible , local integration and resettlement , to give priority to family tracing and reunification , and , where appropriate , to cooperate with international humanitarian and refugee organizations ;  
Urge States to consider taking special measures to protect especially vulnerable persons and groups which may be subject to multiple forms of discrimination on account of their gender , age , national origin , sexual orientation , social or economic status , physical or mental disability , state of health , religious belief or any other condition liable to give rise to discrimination , including racial discrimination ;  
Urge States to give priority to promoting and protecting the full and equal enjoyment by women and men of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind as to race , colour , gender , sexual orientation , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Objectives : ( a ) helping to raise the level of education and training of the Haitian population through improvements to the education system ; ( b ) supporting the economic and social integration of the population through productive employment and social protection ; ( c ) helping to improve the health of the Haitian population in the areas of reproductive health , sexual and child health and sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) / AIDS ; and ( d ) promoting the right to basic social services .  
PP8bis Reaffirming our commitment to combating all manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance on grounds of [ race , lineage , colour , religion , culture , language or national or ethnic origin * ] [ aggravated by forms of multiple discrimination based on reasons of age , gender , [ sexual orientation ] , physical and mental ability disability , or socio-economic status * ] ,  
We also recognize that some persons are victims of multiple discrimination , including on the grounds of race , colour , descent , ethnic , linguistic or national origin , gender , sexual orientation , age , disability , religion , culture , social or economic status , property or birth ;  
The Board also took into consideration in its selection that the Group had decided to keep under consideration at its twenty-sixth session the question of debt bondage , the role of corruption in the perpetuation of slavery and slavery-like practices , problems affecting migrant workers , the protection of child labourers , forced labour , trafficking in human organs and tissues , forced marriages , ways to combat sexual abuse of children inside the family , and the urgent need for adequate help to be offered to victims of such practices .  
Deeply concerned that systematic rape , sexual slavery and slavery-like practices are still being used to humiliate civilians and military personnel , to destroy society and diminish prospects for a peaceful resolution of conflicts and that the resulting severe physical and psychological trauma endanger not only personal recovery but post-conflict reconstruction of the whole society , as pointed out in the above-mentioned report ;  
On 31 July 2000 , the Government of Denmark reported that immigrants and refugees generally enjoyed legal equality with Danish citizens and , like all citizens , they were protected by law against discrimination on the basis of race , colour , religious belief , political observation , sexual orientation or national , social or ethnic origin .  
The mission , which had met with government representatives and a broad cross section of humanitarian partners and visited internally displaced persons locations in Bi , Huambo and Luanda provinces , expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , including forced relocation , targeting of civilians , forced conscription , looting of humanitarian supplies and sexual violence .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
The principle of voluntary and informed choice in respect of the provision of sexual and reproductive health services should be recognized as a basic human right .  
Respect fully international human rights law and international humanitarian law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls and take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence , particularly rape and all other forms of sexual violence during armed conflict , and end impunity and prosecute those responsible for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , including those relating to sexual and other gender-based violence against women and girls ;  
The continuing violations of the human rights of women , in particular forced labour , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation , often committed by military personnel , and especially directed towards women who are returning refugees , internally displaced or belong to ethnic minorities or the political opposition ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their sexual exploitation and through recruitment and all other exploitation by the military , through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups and elevated rates of infant and maternal mortality and malnutrition ;  
The continuing violations of the human rights of women , in particular forced labour , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation , often committed by military personnel , and especially directed towards women who are returning refugees , internally displaced or belong to ethnic minorities or the political opposition ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their sexual exploitation and through recruitment and all other exploitation by the military , through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups and elevated rates of infant and maternal mortality and malnutrition ;  
Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
The " Report " accuses the Chinese Government of adopting legislation to control the Internet , babbling that " the new laws adopted on 26 September 2000 prohibit any material whose content is held to be subverting the state regime , supporting so-called cults , sabotaging reunification with Taiwan , and damaging China 's reputation " ; it also makes the accusation that " special Internet police have been established in about 20 provinces with the aim of removing information with sexual content . "  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
The BA considered that the prolonged close-ups on the sexual characteristic of a woman was exploitative , offensive to the average viewer and denigrating to the female gender .  
Scenarios in which Mr Tsui assists case commanders include serial or bizarre sexual offences or homicide , unexplained arson , threatening or bizarre messages , unexplained deaths requiring psychological autopsy , profiling of missing persons and other unusual crimes and incidents .  
( iv ) Sexual abuse - any act which involves unwanted or forcible touching / activity of a sexual nature or a situation in which an elderly person with physical and mental disabilities submits to sexual activity without consent .  
For example , in the case of the Hospital Authority ( HA ) , there is a set of comprehensive guidelines on management of victims of sexual assaults in its hospitals , including services to be provided by A &amp; amp ; E doctors , as well as coordination in the collection of forensic samples by forensic pathologists and provision of psychological and counselling support by clinical psychologists , psychiatrists and medical social workers . 
" Women have special needs in areas such as physical and mental health , and they face different barriers and difficulties .  These include sexual violence and domestic violence problems , lack of formal education opportunities while they were young , unemployment at middle age , the digital divide , immense pressures faced by working women with dual roles , single parent families lacking sufficient support , as well as difficulties faced by disabled women .  All these lead us to feel that there is a need to empower women , " Ms Kao continued .  
The VCD comprises 12 short episodes , each lasting about three minutes , and features crimes such as triad activities at schools , trafficking in dangerous drugs , selling pirated goods , internet related crimes , common assault , shoplifting , criminal damage , indecent assault and sexual intercourse with underage girl .  
* Most viewers ( ranging from 51.6% to 89.7% ) agreed to retaining the existing restriction / prohibition on advertisements for the following categories of products or services which are unacceptable under the current generic code of practice , namely undertaker service , unlicensed employment services , organisations advertising to giving betting tips , betting , night clubs and massage parlours involving shows of sexual behaviour , escort service targeting persons under 18 and pay-per-call information services of a sexual nature .  
Family doctor Tony Shieh says that the most direct way to reduce sexual stimulation is exercise , which lowers seminal vesicle activity , releases energy , and preempts blood from filling up the sex organ . Besides this , a cold shower before bed , light calisthenics , wearing loose-fitting underwear , avoiding a too-warm blanket , and keeping an active lifestyle to tire oneself out are all ways to help overcome excessive sexual desire .  
But this April a case was discovered in which the individual , a homosexual , had never been abroad and had no foreign sexual partners . This case shattered the myth that one was safe by avoiding foreigners and generated a certain panic " in the circle . "  
The former was limited to a few enthusiasts for the transcendent and sublime ; the latter appealed through claims of instant success , guaranteed universal cures and enhanced sexual performance , but its vulgar " packaging " ensured that its influence was only restricted to a narrow field .  
Since we have come to understand more about the Japanese , We have discovered that generally they are embarrassed about beliefs that might sound unscientific . On the other hand , they are quite open and brash about things that Americans consider to be private , such as personal finance and sexual experience - - especially the men .  
According to a study by the Training and Education Commission of the Ministry of Education , behavioral problems in junior and high school , such as running away from home , skipping school , promiscuous sexual behavior and poor interpersonal relationships are all intimately related to family problems , such as parents and children not getting along or parental absence , divorce or an extramarital affair .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
Last year there was a string of incidents of women who murdered their abusive husbands , sexual harassment on college campuses , and rape . Many women reporters were deeply distressed by the superficial " spin " put on these stories by their newspapers , which deliberately treated the stories as " having pornographic overtones " or as cases of " the war between the sexes . " They had to fight hard to get more balanced reports into the papers .  
Looking at the evolution of " sexual affairs " in dynasties down the ages , a regular pattern emerges : the more prosperous and powerful a dynasty was , the less restrictions it placed on people in sexual matters ; while the more weak and corrupt a dynasty was , the more tightly it controlled people 's lives , and the more severe the constraints it placed on sex .  
Lately Taipei has been all abuzz over the " Lu An-ni incident . " Lu , a student who did not pass the examination to enter a doctoral program , accused professors who gave her the oral examination of plagiarism and sexual harassment . The professors responded that they had done nothing of the kind , and that Lu had an ulterior motive for making the charges .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
The Academia Sinica 's Chiao Hsingkai notes that it is often overlooked that both sexual harassment and rape are repeat offenses . If undiscovered , over a long period an offender may repeatedly play his degrading games . As for how he chooses his victims , that is still uncertain . However , it is often the case that the criminal will pick the easiestlooking target : young , unsophisticated , genteel looking girls .  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
The unlicensed " underground radio stations " stirred up criticism about public affairs , providing a release for dissatisfaction about society and government . As new radio stations have appeared , they have gone to sensational lengths to attract listeners . On the air , young show hosts talk about sexual topics : incest , gigolos , oral sex .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence . " Family relationships , freedom to choose one 's residence , and equality of the sexes , all of which are protected by the constitution , are interrelated , and among the inalienable rights of an individual , " wrote the China Times in an editorial . " It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
Currently sex education classes-covering things like reproductive biology , sexual values , and the use of sanitary napkins and condoms-are being taught in middle and primary schools across Taiwan . Through education at the roots , children can be helped to keep themselves steady through this period of vast change , and build a sexual value system suited to the 21st century .  
Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
Sadly , many adults who do n't understand that this is normal will , as soon as they see a child doing this , beat them or tie their hands . There have even been nursery schools which have forced children to strip and " show the class " in order to humiliate them into stopping . " This type of violent and repressive technique , though it may prevent the behavior for a short time , could very well lead to all kinds of sexual problems for that person in the future , " says Chiang .  
Studies abroad suggest that adult sexual problems such as exposure , fetishes , impotence , or premature ejaculation are all related to repression of sexuality in early childhood . Sufferers of these problems find it impossible to have normal adult sexual relationships , which leads to a terrible loss of happiness over their entire lives .  
Chen Yi-ming points out that male genitalia are less likely to develop sores , and the mucus membranes in female sexual organs have a larger number of monocytes that are receptive to viruses . In addition , seminal fluid contains more viruses than vaginal fluid . For these reasons , women are more easily infected by men than vice versa .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
The book is filled with conflict between old and new values . As Chu explains : " If we take the status of the ' desolate man ' - a homosexual role-as a metaphor , it hints that if a culture has already developed to the point where people do not want to reproduce , to create a next generation , sex becomes elevated to an end in itself , and the natural drive to reproduce becomes expended in sexual consumption , in pursuit of sensual extremes . . . .  
Liao Ching-pi , an associate professor of social work at Soochow University and director of the Yoyuen Social Work Foundation , holds strongly to the newer view . Studies done overseas , says Liao , " show that affairs are most likely to happen with men who are unsuccessful in their careers , suffering from sexual dysfunction , or faced with problems in their family or personal relationships that they ca n't handle . "  
Fortunately , when the integrated nine-year curriculum goes into effect , there will be more time devoted to sex education in junior high and elementary school classrooms . The education will provide the kids with a more complete understanding of sexual issues , including discussions about ethics , behavioral changes , and self-protection . These classes are not just going to focus on sensationalistic aspects of sex .  
Intersexuals ( also known as hermaphrodites ) are people who were born with two sets of sexual organs . They have chromosomal abnormalities or hormonal imbalances and are not transsexuals . People who adopt a persona of the opposite sex for a special reason , such as Mulan ( who took her father 's place in the army ) or the transvestites who change their sex to make a living , can not be counted as true transsexuals .  
In the sexual spectrum , there is a wide range of colors . To divide male and female into two extreme categories of masculine and feminine would make us unable to understand and appreciate disadvantaged groups . "  
For the September edition of Sinorama , your magazine interviewed me on issues related to the protection of human rights for people of diverse sexual orientations ( including homosexuals , bisexuals and transgender people ) . Perhaps for reasons of space , many controversial points were not covered in detail , so I am now writing to give a little further explanation and to again call on people of vision to press the relevant authorities to quickly draft laws to concretely protect the basic human rights of transgender people .  
When art therapy , which uses mental symbols and intuition , is applied to mental illness , sexual abuse , child abuse cases , or to children whose verbal understanding is limited , it is able to gradually lower the patient 's defense mechanisms , build a better relationship between patient and therapist and unearth the old stories that lie buried in the deepest recesses of the subconscious .  
Lin Pen-hsuan , assistant professor at the Institute of Sociology at Nanhua University , reminds us that in this extremely commercialized world , people have moved from viewing the body as taboo , then opening up to an acceptance of it , to seeing that it can be manipulated and played around with . From beauty treatments and body sculpting to sexual promiscuity , the body is often packaged into a variety of discourses and commercial ends . Is there no escape from all of this , even in death ?  
The Archdiocesan Finance Committee held that the deal would bankrupt the archdiocesan since there was an increasing number of allegations of sexual abuse emerging and " dramatic changes had taken place after the agreement was put forward " .  
Certain women who are subject to physical or sexual violence by their drugusing partners or parents may none the less feel responsible for caring for their families or may be without alternative means of livelihood for economic , social or cultural reasons .  
In addition , in a world threatened by acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and sexually transmitted diseases , the ways in which sexual behaviour and contraceptive use are being modified to reduce these risks requires further careful study .  
UNHCR undertakes special programmes to protect women and children from sexual violence , abduction , military recruitment , irregular adoption and other forms of threatening and humiliating treatment that may lead to permanent trauma and social breakdown .  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
Expressing deep concern about the marginalization of rural women , especially young women with small children , women living in extreme poverty in rural areas and the sexual harassment experienced by , and the violence perpetrated against , them , including those in war-affected areas , as well as about the effect of male migrant workers ,  
In introducing the report , the representative pointed out that the priorities set out in the White Paper to the Parliament ( Storting ) in the spring of 1993 included an active child-care policy with a focus on shared family responsibilities between the parents , renewed efforts to reach the goal of equal pay , and more effective actions against the abuse of women and sexual violence .  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
Strengthen vital statistical systems and incorporate gender analysis into publications and research ; give priority to gender differences in research design and in data collection and analysis in order to improve data on morbidity ; and improve data collection on access to health services , [ including access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services , maternal care and family planning , with special priority for adolescent mothers and care of the elderly ] ;

A regional model is a coordinated set of activities in the mental health field in a certain geographic area , each programme consists of training in post traumatic therapy and in assisting victims of sexual violence .  
Reports of rape and sexual violence constituting violations of international humanitarian law continue to be received , although to a lesser extent than earlier in the conflict .  However , the international community needs to remain ever vigilant to ensure that the sexual atrocities against women , children and men do not reoccur on the scale reported in 1992 and 1993 .

Strategic objective L . 8 .  Educate the girl child about social ,  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
Provide more accessible , available and affordable primary health-care services of high quality , including sexual and reproductive health care , which includes family planning information and services , and giving particular attention to maternal and emergency obstetric care , as agreed in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .

Thus , the Special Rapporteur now defines visual pornography as " the visual depiction of a child engaged in explicit sexual activity , real or simulated , or the lewd exhibition of genitals intended for the sexual gratification of the user , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material " .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Bangladesh welcomed the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action , which embodied practical commitments and priorities for action at the national , regional and international levels for preventing the commercial sexual exploitation of children , and for protecting and reintegrating the children who were its victims . 
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation . 
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
In the field of labour a major method is racketeering , a term used to describe a variety of tactics such as engaging in fraudulent deals or extortion through intimidation and blackmail or the abuse of legitimate positions for illegitimate ends , as in the case of businessmen or labour union and government officials .  In the field of vice , organized crime engages in trafficking in women , which involves international prostitution and sexual slavery .  
50 To this definition , the Platform for Action additionally includes the violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , in particular , murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; forced sterilization and forced abortion , coercive / forced use of contraceptives , female infanticide and prenatal sex selection .

Their lower status and the gender roles assigned by society result in unmet needs which are experienced both by drug-using women and female partners of male drug abusers in various social , cultural and economic environments .  Furthermore , it has been found that women are more likely than men to become infected with HIV through both sexual transmission and intravenous injection .  
The plight of women migrant workers who become victims of physical , mental and sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of their employers , their intermediaries , or the police - a situation exacerbated by economic exploitation - is one that calls for concerted action at the international , national and regional levels .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " .  The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
To prevent physical and sexual abuse , the prospective workers must be thoroughly informed of the dangers inherent in domestic work and should be trained in effective ways of responding to and removing themselves from abusive situations .  
Lastly , article 314 of the new Criminal Code imposes a penalty , in the matter of offences against the rights of workers , on persons who are guilty of serious discrimination in public or private employment against any person on the grounds of opinion , religion or belief , ethnicity , race or nationality , gender , sexual orientation , family situation , ill health , disability , avowed legal or trade union representation of workers , being related to other staff members , or use of any of the official languages of the Spanish State .  
Spain recently adopted Act No . 35 / 1995 of 11 December on aid and assistance to victims of violent crimes or violations of sexual freedom , which establishes public assistance to the direct or indirect victims of wilful , violent wrongs resulting in death , serious bodily harm or serious damage to physical or mental health .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
Article 17 includes in the crime of genocide the imposition of measures intended to prevent birth within the group ; article 18 includes provisions that rape , enforced prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse constitute prohibited acts under this article ; and article 20 prohibits outrages upon personal dignity in violation of international humanitarian law , in particular humiliating and degrading treatment , rape , enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault .  
The plight of women migrant workers who become victims of physical , mental and sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of their employers , their intermediaries , or the police - a situation exacerbated by economic exploitation - is one that calls for concerted action at the international , national and regional levels .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " . d / The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
To prevent physical and sexual abuse , the prospective workers must be thoroughly informed of the dangers inherent in domestic work and should be trained in effective ways of responding to and removing themselves from abusive situations .  
The proposed project is also concerned with achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable social and human development ; reproductive health including family planning and sexual health ; and gender sensitivity and women 's empowerment .  
The Criminal Act prescribes punishment in the form of a fine , simple detention or imprisonment for up to two years for any person who , publicly or with the intent of propagating them to a wider circle , makes statements or any other communication by which a group of persons is threatened , insulted or exposed to indignities on the grounds of race , colour , national extraction , ethnic origin , religion or sexual orientation ( cf . sect .  266 B of the Act ) .  
According to the Act on Prohibition of Discrimination Owing to Race , etc . a person who , while performing occupational or non-profit activities , refuses to serve another person under the same conditions as others , owing to the other person 's race , colour , national extraction , ethnic origin , religion or sexual orientation , is punishable with a fine , simple detention or imprisonment for up to six months .  
The relationship between the military and prostitution has been illustrated by cases of soldiers paying for the sexual services of orphaned , abandoned or displaced girls , who are often held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off-duty local soldiers .  
The effects on the mental and psychological health of children subject to commercial sexual exploitation are not easy to diagnose , and can be healed only through expensive and prolonged treatment .  
For while having children trapped in certain unhealthy working conditions may be far from ideal , simply closing this door to children without providing them with viable alternatives may drive them deeper underground into the much more hazardous world of commercial sexual exploitation ;  
The ill-treatment described included beatings , burning with cigarettes , whippings with rubber or leather straps , sexual assault , being hung upside down for prolonged periods , electric shocks , deprivation of sleep , mock executions , the use of fetters , blindfolding for periods of up to 16 days and public humiliation .

At its fifty-second session , the Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 71 , of 23 April 1996 expressed its outrage that the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape had been used as a weapon of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized that rape in the context of armed conflict constituted a war crime and called for the protection and care of rape victims , respect for the special needs of victims of sexual violence in the investigation and prosecution of alleged violations and punishment of those responsible . 
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , and children who are forced to live and / or work in the streets in order to survive .  
A number of the issues raised in the report deserved to be highlighted , including the need to put a stop to the use of children as soldiers , the introduction of a comprehensive international ban on anti-personnel landmines , and the need in conflict situations to provide humanitarian guarantees for the special reproductive health needs of women and girls and steps to protect women and children from rape and other forms of sexual violence .  
Mr . WILMOT ( Ghana ) , commending the expert of the Secretary-General for her report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , observed that it went beyond the five main issues originally listed in General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 to address other pertinent issues such as rape and other forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation , economic sanctions and measures to ensure the education , health , nutrition and psychological well-being of such children .

Belgium is in favour of the adoption of a binding instrument which , supplementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child , would have the effect of compelling the signatory States to rank practices linked to the sexual exploitation of children as penal offences , so that they can be punished under criminal law .  
Against this background , the preparation of the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child has to be welcomed as a major step forward at the international level in translating many of the recommendations contained in the above _ mentioned Council of Europe text , into binding internatonal norms , thus protecting children more effectively against the various forms of sexual exploitation .  Available for consultation with the Secretariat .  
The term " rape " was not defined , and although it was possible to adapt the term " rape " to sociological realities , that is to say to take account of present-day sexual practices , there was a reluctance to do so ; in most cases the only act characterized as rape was that ultimate violation of the person which is likely to result in pregnancy .  [ 66 ] Oral and anal penetrations forced on a person , whether male or female , were , at most , punishable as indecent assaults .  
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
Also with regard to the United States , the Special Rapporteur wishes to express her particular appreciation of the comprehensive training module developed since 1982 by the Office for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , which is responsible for carrying out law enforcement training programmes on juvenile delinquency .  Since 1983 , training programmes on child abuse and sexual exploitation investigative techniques for local law enforcement officials have also been held nationwide .  
The priorities pursued , which the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse , include a multidisciplinary approach , involving social services and mental health workers , to interviewing and investigation , special treatment in court settings which are child-friendly and appropriate to age and status , and continuing care in order to address the lingering effects of commercial sexual exploitation .  Measures are to be reinforced through education systems which provide children with skills and opportunities as a preventive strategy .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .

Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children , as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims , held in Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993 , and reiterating that such acts constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;

The Supreme Court of Canada has incorporated the gender element in its reinterpretation of social group , describing it as a section of society defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic such as gender , linguistic background or sexual orientation .  
The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the existence of commercial sexual exploitation of children , through loosely organized networks , in rich , private houses known as Mbwa kali , which refers to the Beware of fierce dog signs posted outside the gates .  
The meeting had been devoted to three themes : the creation of a favourable environment for the emancipation of teenage girls ; the special need for social protection of adolescent girls ; and teenage health , including sexual and reproductive health .  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health-care programmes , including in sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
To make information and counselling widely available to adolescent girls and boys , especially on human relationships , reproductive and sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases and adolescent pregnancy , in a manner that is confidential and easily accessible , and to emphasize the equal responsibility of girls and boys ;  
Lastly , it should be noted that there remain principal subjects of concern that have a bearing on economic , social and cultural issues , such as the problem of violence against women in all its aspects , including sexual abuse , physical and mental ill-treatment , sexual exploitation of children and sexual harassment at work , which represent a pattern of human rights violations calling for firm and persistent action at the various levels of the State and within civil society .  
Child pornography means the conception , production , presentation , dissemination , whether or not on commercial basis , visual or audio , that constitute a real or simulated representation of a child engaged or depicted as engaged in sexual activity or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child for promoting or satisfying sexual purposes .  
The definition of visual child pornography was to read as follows : Child pornography is the visual depiction of a child , real or simulated , engaged in explicit sexual activity , or the lewd exhibition of genitals , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material .  
Child pornography means any representation of a [ n actual ] child engaged in [ real or simulated ] explicit sexual activities [ or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child , the dominant characteristic of which is depiction for sexual gratification ] .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
Among such practices were female genital circumcision , which also posed grave health risks for females ; arranged marriages without consent and contracted against personal will ; sexual harassment , which had become widespread ; force-feeding ; and removal of children from their mother at an early age .  
The agreed conclusions of the meeting reaffirmed , inter alia , that universal access to quality , comprehensive and affordable health care , including reproductive and sexual health of women throughout the life cycle , are essential requirements for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation / measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation / abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree on common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV / AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .

Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes , and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
We recognize , however , that more preventative health and family life education and counselling programmes relevant to the needs of our youth are required to abate the spate of adolescent pregnancy so that the youth of our nation can make positive , responsible choices about sexual activity and be productive , contributing members of society .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Despite these breakthroughs , it is necessary to continue to focus specific attention on adolescents , to examine the problems related to the ageing of the population , to eliminate sexist stereotypes that still persist in our society and that limit full gender equality in sexual and family life , and to work towards increasing preventive and educational actions related to HIV / AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases , so as to foster heightened risk perception in the Cuban population , among others .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
UNHCR has actively worked , at the level of law , to ensure wider acceptance of the notion that persecution may be effected through sexual violence , as well as of the notion that women asylum-seekers who face harsh or inhuman treatment due to their having transgressed the social mores of the society , may be considered as a " particular social group " within the meaning of Article 1 of the 1951 Convention .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
According to the Committee , there was an increasing tendency to recruit women migrant workers for commercial ( sexual ) exploitation through arranged marriages with foreigners or by getting them to sign contracts of employment that look tempting but rarely reflect the real situation .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
The Recommendation enumerates the factors to be taken into account in determining the types of hazardous work , for example , work which exposes children to physical , psychological or sexual abuse ; work underground , or at dangerous heights ; work with dangerous machinery ; and work in an unhealthy environment .  
It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
Based on information gathered , the Prosecutor believes that sexual crimes were planned , systematic and generalized and that they were committed with the active participation of the soldiers , the Interahamwe and government and administrative authorities at both local and national levels .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
The special sessions strong reinforcement of human rights and the human well-being language of the Programme of Action was particularly welcome , as were the calls for intensified action in implementing the Programme of Action , and the new benchmarks in reproductive and sexual health , access to family planning services , reduced maternal mortality , HIV / AIDS prevention , gender issues and education . 
The Government , in cooperation with the private sector , had also sought to provide shelter and rehabilitative services to girls who had been sexually abused , and a national plan of action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children was being developed .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
These grounds are : sex ; marital status ; religious belief ; ethical belief ; colour , race , ethnic or national origin ( which includes nationality or citizenship ) ; disability ; age ; political opinion ; employment status ; family status ; or sexual orientation .  
These included the lack of a systematic data-collection mechanism , inadequacies pertaining to the birth registration system , the continuing use of corporal punishment by parents and teachers , insufficient awareness and lack of information about ill-treatment and abuse , including sexual abuse , both within and outside of the family , as well as insufficient legal protection measures , appropriate resources and adequately trained personnel to prevent and combat such abuse .  
For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
At the same time , they channel the consciousness of governmental organizations and civil society in order to secure innovative , concerted , intersectorial and multisectorial actions designed to permit a satisfactory sexual and reproductive life at the individual , family and social levels in a climate of equity which promotes healthy and whole lifestyles .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
At home and on the international stage , New Zealand has sought to play an active role in the promotion of the human rights of women and to ensure their full participation in society as equal partners with men , in particular supporting and encouraging sexual and reproductive health rights and other rights of women , which are central to the Programme of Action .  
I must stress again the need for an increase in international assistance , which we , as a developing country , need if we are to reduce the death rate from the HIV AIDS pandemic , from infectious or parasitic diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera , and most of all to meet the needs of young men and women for reproductive and sexual health . 
Securing the right to safe motherhood is also emphasized , along with infertility services and comprehensive care for adolescents in order to promote and develop appropriate sexual and reproductive health and the prevention of cervical , uterine and breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men , while continuing with the national plan for prevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV AIDS .  
The significant internal and outward migration for economic reasons of young men particularly to the United States and young women particularly to Europe , especially Spain in recent times ; high rates of maternal mortality ; and the undoubtedly limited sexual and reproductive rights and the rights of women call for specific measures .  
Promoting healthy and responsible behaviour in the sphere of sexual and reproductive health requires profound cultural change , and the Government therefore considers it important to incorporate population issues into curricula at all levels of the national education system .  
We see ourselves as a strong partner with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) and all other organizations of civil society and Governments in this continued , accelerated and adequately resourced implementation of the key actions of the ICPD Programme of Action , one of the twentieth century ' s major contributions to global thinking about the key role of sexual and reproductive health and rights in promoting equity and development . 
While joining this valuable consensus on the final outcome of the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly , on population and development , and supporting its implementation at both national and international levels , I would like to enter our reservation regarding any provision in the text that condones or encourages , explicitly or otherwise , sexual relations outside the framework of marriage and the family , as defined exclusively as the heterosexual union between man and woman .  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
However , much had already been done ( including the review of measures taken to promote gender equality , the establishment of a national centre to combat ethnic discrimination , the development of a national plan of action for disabled persons ) , and Norways labour legislation had recently been amended to make discrimination based on race , colour , nationality , ethnic origin or sexual preference , in the area of employment , a criminal offence .  
Reforms were needed to protect the rights of the child : education must be improved , childrens courts must be reformed , the practice of recruiting minors to the armed forces must be stopped , hazardous child labour must be prohibited , and the sexual exploitation of children ( who were often exposed to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ) must be combated more effectively .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
In addition to the physical injury resulting from the battery , battering during pregnancy can result in premature labour , miscarriages , recurrent vaginal infections , delivery of premature or low _ birth-weight infants with reduced chances for survival , sexual dysfunction , fear of sex , and sexually transmitted diseases .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
On the other hand , blindfolding , the use of hosing with cold water , straight hanging ( suspension by the raised arms from a crossbar ) , rough physical treatment , sexual abuses and threats of rape , the use of grossly insulting language and the making of threats to the life and physical integrity of detainees or their families still seem rife in many parts of the country .  
Development is unsustainable where the rule of law and equity do not exist ; where ethnic , religious or sexual discrimination are rampant ; where there are restrictions on free speech , free association and the media ; or where large numbers of people live in abject and degrading poverty .  
It is also one of the most effective tools to combat intolerance by opening the gateway to messages of mutual respect , enabling them to circulate freely worldwide , and by encouraging collective actions to oppose and bring to an end such phenomena as hate speech , racism and the sexual and commercial exploitation of , in particular , women and children .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes , including son preference , which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection , discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against women , including female genital mutilation , rape , incest , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation . 
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree upon common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
The new text stated not only that discrimination on grounds of race , age , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , sexual orientation , disability or state of health was prohibited , but also that the State would grant special protection to persons who were at a disadvantage for any of those reasons and would punish those responsible for violations committed against such persons .  
An honorary advisory commission on sexual and reproductive health has been formed ; among its other activities , it is studying and formulating standards on medical and ethical problems relating to assisted reproduction .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification . 
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
Create permanent national and local working groups that include the participation of Governments , NGOs , womens groups and indigenous peoples to ensure that sexual and reproductive rights are explicitly covered in policies and legal reform .  
She also interpreted any representation , by whatever means , of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities not to be applicable to adults acting , posing or dressing as a child .  
The United States understood the definition to include the visual representation of a child , engaged in real or simulated sexual activities , or of the genitalia of a child where the dominant characteristic was depiction for a sexual purpose .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
These steps may include public education , outreach and media campaigns designed to dispel harmful and demeaning stereotypes about women and men , and to remove the religious , cultural and social stigma often associated with sexual violence .  
The Statute defines the forcible transfer of the children of a threatened national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another group as genocide , while rape and sexual slavery are classified as both war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
In general , protection activities of COHCHR prevented illegal arrests as well as excessive detention , and facilitated victims access to legal assistance , release of victims in illegal detention , release of a significant number of adult women and minor girls from confinement and sexual exploitation , provision of shelter to several foreign victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and the arrangement of their safe and voluntary return to their home countries .  
In October 2000 , the Task Force completed new and / or revised Guidelines for the United Nations Resident Coordinator System in the following areas : adolescent sexual and reproductive health ; basic education with special attention to gender disparities ; maternal mortality reduction ; reproductive health ; and HIV / AIDS . UNFPA is actively involved in the reform initiatives of the Secretary-General , and through the UNDG actively contributed to the preparation of the action strategies on halving extreme poverty and girls education . 
The Committee is similarly concerned by the different minimum legal ages for marriage , the absence of a defined minimum age of sexual consent for boys , the very high minimum age for consulting a doctor without parental consent and the extremely low minimum age of criminal responsibility - currently age seven .  
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .  
In its view , the legal protection designed to counter the problem of the sale and abuse of children should not be confined to sexual exploitation ; it was also necessary to condemn the practices which violated international rules governing such matters as adoption .  
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( A / CONF . 183 / 9 ) , which affirms that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence constitute , in defined circumstances , a crime against humanity and / or a war crime , and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female infanticide , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
Condemns violence against women committed in situations of armed conflict , such as murder , rape , including systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , and calls for effective responses to these violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Calls upon all States to take all appropriate national , bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent all forms of violence against children and to protect them from torture and other forms of violence , physical violence including domestic violence , child abuse , mental and sexual violence , abuse by the police and other law enforcement authorities or by employees in juvenile detention centres , orphanages , child care institutions and others , as well as violence in the street and in schools ;  
Calls upon all States to protect refugee children , unaccompanied children seeking asylum and internally displaced children , who are particularly exposed to risks in connection with armed conflict , such as recruitment , sexual violence and exploitation , to pay particular attention to programmes for voluntary repatriation , and wherever possible , local integration and resettlement , to give priority to family tracing and reunification , and , where appropriate , to cooperate with international humanitarian and refugee organizations ;  
Urge States to consider taking special measures to protect especially vulnerable persons and groups which may be subject to multiple forms of discrimination on account of their gender , age , national origin , sexual orientation , social or economic status , physical or mental disability , state of health , religious belief or any other condition liable to give rise to discrimination , including racial discrimination ;  
Urge States to give priority to promoting and protecting the full and equal enjoyment by women and men of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind as to race , colour , gender , sexual orientation , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status ;  
Objectives : ( a ) helping to raise the level of education and training of the Haitian population through improvements to the education system ; ( b ) supporting the economic and social integration of the population through productive employment and social protection ; ( c ) helping to improve the health of the Haitian population in the areas of reproductive health , sexual and child health and sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) / AIDS ; and ( d ) promoting the right to basic social services .  
PP8bis Reaffirming our commitment to combating all manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance on grounds of [ race , lineage , colour , religion , culture , language or national or ethnic origin * ] [ aggravated by forms of multiple discrimination based on reasons of age , gender , [ sexual orientation ] , physical and mental ability disability , or socio-economic status * ] ,  
We also recognize that some persons are victims of multiple discrimination , including on the grounds of race , colour , descent , ethnic , linguistic or national origin , gender , sexual orientation , age , disability , religion , culture , social or economic status , property or birth ;  
The Board also took into consideration in its selection that the Group had decided to keep under consideration at its twenty-sixth session the question of debt bondage , the role of corruption in the perpetuation of slavery and slavery-like practices , problems affecting migrant workers , the protection of child labourers , forced labour , trafficking in human organs and tissues , forced marriages , ways to combat sexual abuse of children inside the family , and the urgent need for adequate help to be offered to victims of such practices .  
Deeply concerned that systematic rape , sexual slavery and slavery-like practices are still being used to humiliate civilians and military personnel , to destroy society and diminish prospects for a peaceful resolution of conflicts and that the resulting severe physical and psychological trauma endanger not only personal recovery but post-conflict reconstruction of the whole society , as pointed out in the above-mentioned report ;  
On 31 July 2000 , the Government of Denmark reported that immigrants and refugees generally enjoyed legal equality with Danish citizens and , like all citizens , they were protected by law against discrimination on the basis of race , colour , religious belief , political observation , sexual orientation or national , social or ethnic origin .  
The mission , which had met with government representatives and a broad cross section of humanitarian partners and visited internally displaced persons locations in Bi , Huambo and Luanda provinces , expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , including forced relocation , targeting of civilians , forced conscription , looting of humanitarian supplies and sexual violence .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
The principle of voluntary and informed choice in respect of the provision of sexual and reproductive health services should be recognized as a basic human right .  
Respect fully international human rights law and international humanitarian law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls and take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence , particularly rape and all other forms of sexual violence during armed conflict , and end impunity and prosecute those responsible for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , including those relating to sexual and other gender-based violence against women and girls ;  
The continuing violations of the human rights of women , in particular forced labour , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation , often committed by military personnel , and especially directed towards women who are returning refugees , internally displaced or belong to ethnic minorities or the political opposition ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their sexual exploitation and through recruitment and all other exploitation by the military , through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups and elevated rates of infant and maternal mortality and malnutrition ;  
The continuing violations of the human rights of women , in particular forced labour , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation , often committed by military personnel , and especially directed towards women who are returning refugees , internally displaced or belong to ethnic minorities or the political opposition ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their sexual exploitation and through recruitment and all other exploitation by the military , through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups and elevated rates of infant and maternal mortality and malnutrition ;  
Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;
