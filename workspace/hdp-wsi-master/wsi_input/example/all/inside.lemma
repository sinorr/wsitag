Thus every year on the 24th day of the twelfth month on the lunar calender , all the deities who had been sent among men had to return to the court , and report on the beneficence and evil of each human ; they could only return among the people on the fourth day of the first month in the next year .  
" These 18 ob jects serve as a pretty good representation of Ming art from both inside the imperial court and out , " says National Palace Museum Vice Director Chang Lin-sheng . The Emperor Hsiao-tzung of the Ming Dynasty , for instance , with its subject 's kindly , refined expression and its harmoniously matching background , is a work of great historical value and a masterpiece of the imperial academy .  
At Least Someone Cares : The 50 or so foster children raised by the Chang 's have indluded mentally handicapped children , seriously abused children and other problem children . " One kid was so clever he broke the code for the safe and swiped the money inside , " Mr . Chang says , shaking his head and smiling bitterly .  
For example , the Lungshan Temple in Lukang could be listed as a world class artifact . The quality of the construction , the interior environment , and the primitive construction have all been preserved rather well . In particular , having National Heritage Award winner Wang Kun-shan 's nan-kuan troupe inside gave the old temple real vitality ; I really loved that .  
After being pulled from the oil , it is golden in color , crispy on the outside and tender inside . Its special flavor is matched with heavy flavorings like hot sauce , garlic , and vinegar . Or you can add some pickled vegetables .  
At the beach play ground at Mashakou in Tainan , a half-storey tall dike was built right on the golden beach . Those operating the recreational area figured they might as well put up a swimming pool inside the dike - - and there ended up being more people playing in the pool than on the beach .  
Disturbing the grave site is equally as regrettable as the loss of the objects inside the graves . When relics are discovered without relation to the excavation area and its surrounding environment , their archaeological and historical value is damaged . "  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
From these everyday natural ingredients he completes a work of art . The hues of the glaze are restrained , serene and firm ; they are the colors of Lungteng Village , colors whose power pours forth from the inside , reflecting its master 's wild head of hair and spirited eyes . Earth and man draw near to each other !  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
At that moment the sound of weeping again drifted across from the dune , and she recognized her lover 's voice . Giving a loud cry of " Dune Boy , " Crescent Moon fell into a faint inside the palanquin . The bearers heard her cry , turned round to look , and shouted in surprise , " The bride 's fainted ! "  
TapaishaAt Green Island 's southern extremity , in the water along the coast where the depth exceeds ten meters , there are a lot of large reefs , some of which even rise above the surface of the water . From 50 to 250 meters out , you can see indications of two gigantic reefs . The reefs ' rocks have a great variety of shapes , and giant pieces of coral are spread about . If divers go into the caves , they can see many creatures seeking refuge inside .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside . In the past two or three years , reform groups have been commissioned by the government in some areas , and more and more have begun to be incorporated within the parameters of the system .  
The cans and bottles , with a thin layer of dirt and decayed leaves stuck to the bottom , have been picked up , but few of the onlookers realize yet that the real secret lies in the water inside the container . The two veterans at this game open their backpacks , take out a strainer and a small handled pan , and set to work .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
Returning from distant travels , neither happy faces nor passionate embraces welcomed him . A lonely figure in front of a ramshackle house , he heard sobbing from inside . He bounded through the door to discover his youngest son lying dead on the bare planks of the wooden bed . Grouped around the small corpse were the rest of his family-as thin as rails , dressed in rags , hungrier even than his dead son .  
" At the Harvest Festival , when you put on your betel nut bag , it means you are grown up , and at this kind of social occasion grown-up Ami girls will place betel nuts and liquor inside the betel nut pouch of the man they like best . Hence the betel nut pouch is also called the ' sweetheart pouch . ' This forthright , liberated way of making friends has been part of Ami culture since ancient times , " says ' Api .  
" It seemed that wrapped up inside her blanket was a little printing press , printing sheet after sheet of warm , damp , pale yellow diapers . . . One began to hear the sound of hammers from our bedroom . We put up steel wires , one , two , three , four , five , six .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
" We men are very lonely inside and need opportunities for growth and exchange , " says resident Chang Chih-pin , a physics instructor at Hung Kuang Institute of Technology . He used to be introverted and taciturn , but after moving here and getting involved in management committee work , he has been molded by his fellow committee members ' soft and maternal ways , and has gradually opened up .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
There was clear evidence that the artifacts had been deliberately burnt and broken before being arranged neatly inside the burial pit . Many of the jade pieces in the pits were whitened , for example , and the edges of the bronzes were curled and warped .  
Many victims who had already escaped from a dangerous structure went back inside when they heard the telephone ringing . They were concerned that a relative calling might be worried if no one answered the phone . After the earthquake , love for family members actually posed a danger to them .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
In a design which draws on the spirit of the gardens of Suzhou , just inside the entrance the wall is pierced high up by a carved wooden ornamental window in a rhombus pattern , which lets light shine on the sumptuously painted panels of the high caisson ceiling , to impart a sense of intricate workmanship and opulence .  
When you first enter the Taipei Sea World , inside the large tank , visible through the transparent glass , sea creatures of brilliant colors and strange movements meander through the blue water . Recent special exhibitions have featured the delicate , translucent Clione lima-cina ( known variously as the sea angel , sea butterfly , and " angel of the floating ice " ) from the North Pole , and the awesome giant northern sea octopus . The aquari-um 's undersea tunnel makes visitors feel even more that they have entered another world .  
At 6 am the sun is just breaking over the horizon , but three round , camouflaged tents are already pitched facing a cliff by the side of a logging road in the Shihting Mountain District . A person hides in each of the stifling little tents , which are sealed up tight except for an " observation window " out of which a camera lens protrudes . The photographers inside have eyes only for the dead acacia 30 meters away .  
It was chilly inside the shack , and Lin Chong decided to go down to the village for some liquor . Following the military veteran 's directions he passed an old temple and came upon a little inn . The owner recognized the veteran 's bottle-gourd and gave Lin a friendly welcome . Once Lin had warmed up he bought some dried beef and liquor , and headed back to the fodder depot .  
12 . He found the temple by the light of the snow . Once inside he jammed a rock against the door to keep it shut , and tried to make himself comfortable . The temple was damp and draughty , and Lin could n't sleep . He chewed on the dried beef , sipped at the liquor and waited for dawn .  
On May 20 , President Chen was officially sworn in at a ceremony carried out inside the Presidential Palace . Afterwards he went outside to deliver his inaugural address to a waiting audience in the square in front of the Presidential Palace , at which point he repeated the pose that he had assumed while taking the oath . The president did not salute anyone , and I would like to assure Mr . Lin that his gesture did not have any Nazi implications . We beg Mr . Lin 's understanding regarding this issue .  
67-year-old Ku Teh-fu looks a bit like Father Time himself . He is a wisp of a man with many a tooth missing and skin burnished dark brown after years of working under the hot sun , but a mischievous smile hints at the young heart that beats inside him . Peering intently out of a pair of big , bright eyes , he exudes an unmistakable air of straightforwardness .  
Yet these flowers go quite unnoticed , for the whole of the plants ' reproductive process , from flowering to pollination to fruiting , takes place hidden inside the hollow , fleshy fruiting bodies that develop into figs .  
Morticians , desperate to be first inside the mortuary to claim a fresh corpse , have been known to assault security guards keeping them out , and recently there was a notorious case involving a Jane Doe that a funeral firm in Hualien had been holding for two weeks . When relatives finally identified the body they were billed NT $ 150,000 and were told : " Pay up , or the stiff stays ! "  
The legend says that these former slaves later slaughtered a group of British soldiers who had landed on the island to explore it . When a British naval vessel discovered the soldiers ' fate , the sailors piled brush at the mouth of the cave in which the slaves were hiding , doused it in oil , and set it alight . The fire burned for three days , killing all of the several hundred slaves inside . This sad event is the origin of the cave 's name .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
The unseen , untouchable realm of nanotech has already captured the imagination of the world . Whether you 're talking about " cellular automata " that patrol inside a human body to keep blood vessels clean or repair damaged cells , or tiny " mosquito " missiles so small that they are undetectable by radar , both are nanotech marvels .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
While the raw lacquer is toxic , once it dries it is insoluble to all chemicals ; and its toxins are trapped inside . Thus there are no health worries , and lacquer ware is impervious to humidity , heat , acids , and alkalis . It is a natural insulator , and remains perfectly preserved even when buried underground for ages . Few other art objects can compare .  
First , he sculpts the underlying picture or pattern onto the eggshell using the " relief " technique . Then with the lamplight beaming through the eggshell , with the tip of an extremely fine brush he adds acrylic lacquer through tiny bored holes , and with lamplight passing through the shell , he uses the " mirror image inner painting method " to paint the colored lacquer on the inside of the eggshell . When the work is displayed against the light , the colors of the inner painting reveal themselves .  
However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time . Generally speaking , once infected , there is a roughly 10% chance of a person developing an active case during the rest of his life . Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .  
According to Wu , schools ought to try to find the underlying reasons why " problem students " have problems . They should be less concerned with a wayward appearance than with trying to understand and deal with underlying causes , because once these are taken care of the rest will follow . If schools spend all their time trying to control outward appearances without exploring what is going on inside students , all they will achieve is a temporary stifling of emotions , which will sooner or later explode in a much more destructive way .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
The United States itself has practised various types of terrorism against us , from the imposition of embargoes to military provocations in our territorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful cities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering of ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry out acts of sabotage inside Libya , with the assistance of United States authorities . 
They considered educative measures and publicity as most important to curb the level of violence against women and asked whether particular programmes existed to deal with the problem of violence against particularly marginalized groups , such as refugee , poor and disabled women .  In reply to further questions , the representatives stated that assault and battery , whether committed inside or outside the home , could be prosecuted without the consent of the victim .  
The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .

The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1072 ( 1996 ) of 30 August 1996 , in which the Council decided to re-examine the question of Burundi on 31 October 1996 and requested me to report by that time on the situation in Burundi , including on the status of the immediate and unconditional negotiations which the Council required all of Burundi 's political parties and factions without exception , whether inside or outside the country and including representatives of civil society to initiate , with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .

Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .

The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .

" These 18 ob jects serve as a pretty good representation of Ming art from both inside the imperial court and out , " says National Palace Museum Vice Director Chang Lin-sheng . The Emperor Hsiao-tzung of the Ming Dynasty , for instance , with its subject 's kindly , refined expression and its harmoniously matching background , is a work of great historical value and a masterpiece of the imperial academy .  
At Least Someone Cares : The 50 or so foster children raised by the Chang 's have indluded mentally handicapped children , seriously abused children and other problem children . " One kid was so clever he broke the code for the safe and swiped the money inside , " Mr . Chang says , shaking his head and smiling bitterly .  
For example , the Lungshan Temple in Lukang could be listed as a world class artifact . The quality of the construction , the interior environment , and the primitive construction have all been preserved rather well . In particular , having National Heritage Award winner Wang Kun-shan 's nan-kuan troupe inside gave the old temple real vitality ; I really loved that .  
After being pulled from the oil , it is golden in color , crispy on the outside and tender inside . Its special flavor is matched with heavy flavorings like hot sauce , garlic , and vinegar . Or you can add some pickled vegetables .  
At the beach play ground at Mashakou in Tainan , a half-storey tall dike was built right on the golden beach . Those operating the recreational area figured they might as well put up a swimming pool inside the dike - - and there ended up being more people playing in the pool than on the beach .  
Disturbing the grave site is equally as regrettable as the loss of the objects inside the graves . When relics are discovered without relation to the excavation area and its surrounding environment , their archaeological and historical value is damaged . "  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
From these everyday natural ingredients he completes a work of art . The hues of the glaze are restrained , serene and firm ; they are the colors of Lungteng Village , colors whose power pours forth from the inside , reflecting its master 's wild head of hair and spirited eyes . Earth and man draw near to each other !  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
At that moment the sound of weeping again drifted across from the dune , and she recognized her lover 's voice . Giving a loud cry of " Dune Boy , " Crescent Moon fell into a faint inside the palanquin . The bearers heard her cry , turned round to look , and shouted in surprise , " The bride 's fainted ! "  
TapaishaAt Green Island 's southern extremity , in the water along the coast where the depth exceeds ten meters , there are a lot of large reefs , some of which even rise above the surface of the water . From 50 to 250 meters out , you can see indications of two gigantic reefs . The reefs ' rocks have a great variety of shapes , and giant pieces of coral are spread about . If divers go into the caves , they can see many creatures seeking refuge inside .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside . In the past two or three years , reform groups have been commissioned by the government in some areas , and more and more have begun to be incorporated within the parameters of the system .  
The cans and bottles , with a thin layer of dirt and decayed leaves stuck to the bottom , have been picked up , but few of the onlookers realize yet that the real secret lies in the water inside the container . The two veterans at this game open their backpacks , take out a strainer and a small handled pan , and set to work .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
The construction of the brush 's hairs , long on the inside and short on the outside , forms a conical tip . As the brush is lifted , pressed , twirled and bent , its hairs brought close together or spread apart , the ink metamorphoses into any number of marvelous , lovely , moving lines .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
Returning from distant travels , neither happy faces nor passionate embraces welcomed him . A lonely figure in front of a ramshackle house , he heard sobbing from inside . He bounded through the door to discover his youngest son lying dead on the bare planks of the wooden bed . Grouped around the small corpse were the rest of his family-as thin as rails , dressed in rags , hungrier even than his dead son .  
" At the Harvest Festival , when you put on your betel nut bag , it means you are grown up , and at this kind of social occasion grown-up Ami girls will place betel nuts and liquor inside the betel nut pouch of the man they like best . Hence the betel nut pouch is also called the ' sweetheart pouch . ' This forthright , liberated way of making friends has been part of Ami culture since ancient times , " says ' Api .  
" It seemed that wrapped up inside her blanket was a little printing press , printing sheet after sheet of warm , damp , pale yellow diapers . . . One began to hear the sound of hammers from our bedroom . We put up steel wires , one , two , three , four , five , six .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
" We men are very lonely inside and need opportunities for growth and exchange , " says resident Chang Chih-pin , a physics instructor at Hung Kuang Institute of Technology . He used to be introverted and taciturn , but after moving here and getting involved in management committee work , he has been molded by his fellow committee members ' soft and maternal ways , and has gradually opened up .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
There was clear evidence that the artifacts had been deliberately burnt and broken before being arranged neatly inside the burial pit . Many of the jade pieces in the pits were whitened , for example , and the edges of the bronzes were curled and warped .  
Many victims who had already escaped from a dangerous structure went back inside when they heard the telephone ringing . They were concerned that a relative calling might be worried if no one answered the phone . After the earthquake , love for family members actually posed a danger to them .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
In a design which draws on the spirit of the gardens of Suzhou , just inside the entrance the wall is pierced high up by a carved wooden ornamental window in a rhombus pattern , which lets light shine on the sumptuously painted panels of the high caisson ceiling , to impart a sense of intricate workmanship and opulence .  
When you first enter the Taipei Sea World , inside the large tank , visible through the transparent glass , sea creatures of brilliant colors and strange movements meander through the blue water . Recent special exhibitions have featured the delicate , translucent Clione lima-cina ( known variously as the sea angel , sea butterfly , and " angel of the floating ice " ) from the North Pole , and the awesome giant northern sea octopus . The aquari-um 's undersea tunnel makes visitors feel even more that they have entered another world .  
At 6 am the sun is just breaking over the horizon , but three round , camouflaged tents are already pitched facing a cliff by the side of a logging road in the Shihting Mountain District . A person hides in each of the stifling little tents , which are sealed up tight except for an " observation window " out of which a camera lens protrudes . The photographers inside have eyes only for the dead acacia 30 meters away .  
It was chilly inside the shack , and Lin Chong decided to go down to the village for some liquor . Following the military veteran 's directions he passed an old temple and came upon a little inn . The owner recognized the veteran 's bottle-gourd and gave Lin a friendly welcome . Once Lin had warmed up he bought some dried beef and liquor , and headed back to the fodder depot .  
12 . He found the temple by the light of the snow . Once inside he jammed a rock against the door to keep it shut , and tried to make himself comfortable . The temple was damp and draughty , and Lin could n't sleep . He chewed on the dried beef , sipped at the liquor and waited for dawn .  
On May 20 , President Chen was officially sworn in at a ceremony carried out inside the Presidential Palace . Afterwards he went outside to deliver his inaugural address to a waiting audience in the square in front of the Presidential Palace , at which point he repeated the pose that he had assumed while taking the oath . The president did not salute anyone , and I would like to assure Mr . Lin that his gesture did not have any Nazi implications . We beg Mr . Lin 's understanding regarding this issue .  
67-year-old Ku Teh-fu looks a bit like Father Time himself . He is a wisp of a man with many a tooth missing and skin burnished dark brown after years of working under the hot sun , but a mischievous smile hints at the young heart that beats inside him . Peering intently out of a pair of big , bright eyes , he exudes an unmistakable air of straightforwardness .  
Yet these flowers go quite unnoticed , for the whole of the plants ' reproductive process , from flowering to pollination to fruiting , takes place hidden inside the hollow , fleshy fruiting bodies that develop into figs .  
Morticians , desperate to be first inside the mortuary to claim a fresh corpse , have been known to assault security guards keeping them out , and recently there was a notorious case involving a Jane Doe that a funeral firm in Hualien had been holding for two weeks . When relatives finally identified the body they were billed NT $ 150,000 and were told : " Pay up , or the stiff stays ! "  
The legend says that these former slaves later slaughtered a group of British soldiers who had landed on the island to explore it . When a British naval vessel discovered the soldiers ' fate , the sailors piled brush at the mouth of the cave in which the slaves were hiding , doused it in oil , and set it alight . The fire burned for three days , killing all of the several hundred slaves inside . This sad event is the origin of the cave 's name .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
The unseen , untouchable realm of nanotech has already captured the imagination of the world . Whether you 're talking about " cellular automata " that patrol inside a human body to keep blood vessels clean or repair damaged cells , or tiny " mosquito " missiles so small that they are undetectable by radar , both are nanotech marvels .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
In the innermost chamber is the surgical theater , divided into three sections-hernia , cleft lip and palate , and tumors . While family members patiently wait under the tent outside , inside , where air conditioners ( hastily set up only a couple of days before ) clank away noisily , patients in various stages of surgery are laid out on ten provisional operating tables made up out of desks and chairs . Amazingly , their expressions do not show the least fear ; on the contrary , they appear to be looking forward to treatment .  
While the raw lacquer is toxic , once it dries it is insoluble to all chemicals ; and its toxins are trapped inside . Thus there are no health worries , and lacquer ware is impervious to humidity , heat , acids , and alkalis . It is a natural insulator , and remains perfectly preserved even when buried underground for ages . Few other art objects can compare .  
First , he sculpts the underlying picture or pattern onto the eggshell using the " relief " technique . Then with the lamplight beaming through the eggshell , with the tip of an extremely fine brush he adds acrylic lacquer through tiny bored holes , and with lamplight passing through the shell , he uses the " mirror image inner painting method " to paint the colored lacquer on the inside of the eggshell . When the work is displayed against the light , the colors of the inner painting reveal themselves .  
However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time . Generally speaking , once infected , there is a roughly 10% chance of a person developing an active case during the rest of his life . Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .  
According to Wu , schools ought to try to find the underlying reasons why " problem students " have problems . They should be less concerned with a wayward appearance than with trying to understand and deal with underlying causes , because once these are taken care of the rest will follow . If schools spend all their time trying to control outward appearances without exploring what is going on inside students , all they will achieve is a temporary stifling of emotions , which will sooner or later explode in a much more destructive way .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
The United States itself has practised various types of terrorism against us , from the imposition of embargoes to military provocations in our territorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful cities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering of ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry out acts of sabotage inside Libya , with the assistance of United States authorities . 
They considered educative measures and publicity as most important to curb the level of violence against women and asked whether particular programmes existed to deal with the problem of violence against particularly marginalized groups , such as refugee , poor and disabled women .  In reply to further questions , the representatives stated that assault and battery , whether committed inside or outside the home , could be prosecuted without the consent of the victim .  
The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .

In many recent articles , major British newspapers have reported overt United States interference in Iraq 's internal affairs and the fact that the CIA employs numerous " assets " inside Iraq to carry out clandestine operations against Iraq 's national Government .  
However , under Rule 644 ( i ) , " No convicted prisoner inside the prison other than a camp or temporary prison shall be fettered except on the ground that he is violent , dangerous or had escaped or attempted to escape " .  
Such practices are also liable to generate a worrying state of affairs , not only for Iraq , but also for Turkey and the region as a whole , which is primarily afflicted by the irregular situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq , not to mention the human injury to which Iraqi citizens are exposed as a result of the illegitimate activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside the territory of the Republic of Iraq . 
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1072 ( 1996 ) of 30 August 1996 , in which the Council decided to re-examine the question of Burundi on 31 October 1996 and requested me to report by that time on the situation in Burundi , including on the status of the immediate and unconditional negotiations which the Council required all of Burundi 's political parties and factions without exception , whether inside or outside the country and including representatives of civil society to initiate , with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .

During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .

The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .
