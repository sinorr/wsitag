It is reported that the two ethnic groups living in the Ituri region , Hema and Lendu , have been in rivalry for a long time , fighting for land resources and the like .  In recent months , there have been continuous mass armed clashes , causing tremendous casulty and losses .  
In Sichuan Province , the secretary of the provincial party committee and the governor have assumed full responsibility for improving the style of the party , building a clean and honest government , and fighting against corruption .  They have divided this year 's anti-corruption work into 10 major tasks and 36 specific tasks .  The organization department of the provincial party committee , the provincial planning commission , the provincial financial department and 20 other units are taking lead in fighting against corruption and implementing various measures at their own and related departments and units .  
Wen Jiabao suggested organizing all Party leading cadres to seriously study the important speech made by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , deeply carrying out the spirit of the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , working in line with the actual condition of the financial sector , setting up specific measures and taking practical actions to carry forward improving the Party ï¿½s work style and building a clean and honest government and fighting corruption within the financial sector .  
For months , the officers and men - fighting with the stormy waves , keeping away from hidden reefs and crossing island chains deep down the ocean - had been exploring the way in unfamiliar waters , venturing into " deadly sea areas , " and struggling with Pacific storms .  Deep down the " Dragon King 's palace , " they set a new long voyage record in the history of conventional submarines .  
Third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .  We should carry out a special task to reform organizations and consolidate those people who have not been recruited in accordance with regulations and who are not suitable for their jobs .  In this way , we can continuously strengthen the invigoration and fighting capacity of the contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  
We must persist in treating war tasks as our ultimate tasks and firmly establish the thought of " doing military construction for future wars . "  In the construction of headquarters , we must truly put the emphasis on winning local wars under the condition of modern technology , especially high technology .  We must strive to improve our military 's ability in planning and directing military construction as well as in organizing and directing troops in fighting .  
They must conform to the requirements of the " Guidelines " and the directives of Party committees , chief officers and higher-level headquarters .  They must strengthen their planning , leadership , urgency and checks and ensure that construction in all aspects is implemented .  They must lay a firm foundation for improving our military 's ability in defense and fighting under modern situations and for striving to promote the transcentury development of the construction of military modernization .  
During the discussion , officers and men reviewed the army 's glorious history in fighting the people 's war , defeating the strong by the weak , and defeating the superior by the inferior .  They spoke glowingly of the army 's tremendous achievements in revolutionization , modernization , and regularization and reaffirmed their confidence of winning the regional war under the high-tech condition .  
The party committees and governments at all levels , the population , resources and environmental departments , as well as relevant departments should fully understand the extreme importance and arduousness of this work , firmly cultivate the ideology of " fighting a protracted battle , " overcome the blindly optimistic , careless and lax sentiments , and persist in grasping this work with unremitting efforts .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
All sorts of feelings welled up in the mind of deputy Zhu Wenquan at the mention of units ' particular ability to endure hardship , special proficiency in combat , and combat style of stubborn and heroic fighting , fearing no sacrifice ; he recalled how he had led his units to take part in a combined exercise , saying : " We traveled from our barracks to the exercise ground without suffering one casualty or having one vehicle overturning , and completely fulfilled our mission .  
Deputy Zhang Miansheng , an instructor of a certain unit of Guangzhou Military Region , fully agreed with what deputy Zhu Wenquan said : " Whether it is military exercises , or the fight against flood in 1998 , they expressed the interests of the state and people ; ours is an invincible iron army that dares to fight tough battles , is skilled in ferocious fighting , and fears no bloodshed or sacrifice . "  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
Under this circumstance , how do we prevent the United Nations from being swept to one side again ; how do we make the relations between big nations remain " unbroken amid fighting " ; and how do we conduct peacekeeping missions , under the auspices or with the approval of this major international organization , in a more cautious manner and on a more rationale scale , are " complicated arts " that need to be studied .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The basic purpose of this " three stresses " positive education among all army 's Party organizations is through centralized and general education to practically strengthen grass-roots Party organizations ' cohesive force and combat capability , enhance Party members ' political steadfastness and ethical purity , bring into full play the grass-roots Party organizations ' role of fighting force and the exemplary vanguard role of the Party members , and further consolidate foundations of the Party 's absolute leadership over the army .  
conducted education and training with strenuous efforts , established and improved various forms of educational and training systems , and continuously raised the political and professional qualities and legal awareness of policemen , thereby effectively improving the fighting capacity of the public security force .  
Particularly , the activities of national separatist organizations are getting brisker and brisker .  These organizations manage to sell weapons and narcotics , train terrorists , and even stand for fighting a " holy war . "  Their terrorist and violent nature has become conspicuous with each passing day , thus seriously threatening the regional peace and stability as well as the people 's life and property safety .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
He said : " The Zhoushan garrison is a heroic unit with glorious traditions ; during the war years it swept through the length and breadth of the land , fighting in the north and south ; it fought many tough and victorious battles , and a large number of heroic units and meritorious models emerged such as the ' Luoyang battalion ' and the famous combat heroes Lin Maocheng and Guo Jisheng .  
Only if the problems of each system , each subject and each battle line are solved in a deep and detailed manner and if our fighting capacities are strengthened , only then can the entire army be propelled to prepare for military battles on a deeper and more solid basis and the army can honor the sacred mission assigned by the Party and state at any time .  
This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
" Eliminating pornography and fighting illegal publications " is a matter of social stability , of the physical and mental health of our young , of economic order , and of our international image .  The struggle needs to be looked at from a political point of view , and it needs a great deal of emphasis .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Only with such " background color " can they face the windy and snowy plateau with smiles ; can they " live through difficulties to an extraordinary degree , withstand hardships to an extraordinary degree , be competent in fighting to an extraordinary degree , and be enterprising to an extraordinary degree " ;  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
During the visit , both sides signed six agreements including a petrochemical base cooperation project worth $ 6 billion and a coal mine fire fighting project .  The agreements inject new vitality into the two countries ' economic and trade cooperation and will produce a major and deep impact on the two countries ' long-term cooperation .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
Amid a wave of criticisms , Tang Yao-ming , chief of the general staff of the Taiwan military , had no choice but to hold an urgent news conference on 7 July . Using fallacious reasoning , he claimed : The so-called " fighting a decisive battle offshore " is very different in meaning from " fighting an offshore decisive battle " .  
Fujian has promulgated and put into effect the " Fujian Management Regulations for Coastal Shipping , Border Defense , and Public Security " , setting up a " top official " leadership responsibility system for fighting illegal emigration , for a harsh crackdown by law on snake-heads and human smugglers .  And it has set up an exclusive snake-head crackdown taskforce , engaging in " online snake-head arrests " , all of which steps show Fujian 's firm stand and resolve against illegal emigration .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
Statistical data from a battlefield showed that , after a tank crew have stayed in a small and closed space for a long time where it is filled with various kinds of radiation , waste gases , electromagnetic waves , heat , and noises , tank speed reduced by 19 percent , time to complete shooting increased by 35 percent , miss-hitting increased by 4 percent , and , in real-combat exercises , their fighting capacity declined by 7 to 10 percent everyday .  
It can be said that , it is precisely because of the effective control provided by information that the strike weapons ' efficacy has been raised alarmingly high , that information has become a tool to redouble the fighting power , and that war has turned from large-scaled destruction and even total annihilation of the opponent in the traditional sense of the word into controlled precision strikes , into controllable strikes of the smallest number and best optimization to attain the greatest combat efficiency .  
At dawn , this reporter found at the mouth of the mountain , which was known as " Xiyangkou " , that the " special assault group " members , who had engaged in fierce fighting overnight and had broken through a defensive zone guarded closely by the " enemy " forces , which was as long as 35 kilometers , had become exhausted and had bloody cuts on their faces and hands .  
Behind the tough talk about successfully fighting two modern wars is reflected the hollow essence of the Americans in bullying the weak with strength and bullying the weak but fearing the strong .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of fighting with firepower and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war by fighting with firepower .  
In view of the some 100 specialties that had emerged under the new structure , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee focused their attention on a " combined capability " which proved to be a key link in the generation of fighting capacity , and issued a " written pledge " : Vying with one another to become " an expert in making a combined use of weapons " in studies , research , training , appraisals , and military exercises .  
When the fighting entered the decisive stage , our armored troops , which had driven through snowy mountains , icy paths , marshland , and obstacles , suddenly pounced on the " enemy troops " , which were paradropped .  In this way , the " enemy 's " attempt to attack us from the front and the rear simultaneously was foiled .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
The breeding and spread of corrupt practices have severely weakened the unifying force and the fighting capacity of our party , and have disrupted the smooth progress of the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
In order to increase their large-scale airdropping and fighting capability and their capability to make surprise attacks on the ground with motor-driven firepower , they have made a series of bold attempts in airdropping heavy equipment .  They have succeeded in several dozen experiments in airdropping command cars , large trucks , fuel tankers , and cannons , thus properly solving crucial technical problems in loading , tying down , dropping , releasing , buffering and preventing toppling over upon landing , of large equipment .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
Guangzhou Military Area Command devoted firm and resolute effort to formulating fighting strength and logistic supply abilities on the basis of military units as a whole .  This measure focused on the crucial point in the current construction of fighting strength throughout the military .  It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria .  
Faced with the most vicious aggressors who were armed to the teeth and under the circumstances of fighting an extremely brutal war , the officers and men of our army fought in a dauntless-heroism spirit of conquering all enemy and all difficulties .  They crossed ice-covered lands , slept on snow-covered areas , fought a bloody battle , and smashed the myth that the US army was unconquerable .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
In accordance with the requirements laid down in its five-year program , the division 's party committee has divided fighting capacity building into four major aspects , namely , political work , military work , logistical support , and equipment and technical support ; has tackled bottlenecks which prevent new-type equipment from turning into all-round fighting capacity by focusing on key and thorny issues ; and has laid a solid foundation step by step .  
The division has also gradually established and refined through constant explorations an operational application system , a cadre and backbone training system , a training and support system , and a comprehensive assessment system , and has thus brought about profound changes for essential elements of fighting capacity in each and every aspect and enhanced its all-round operational capability by a large margin .  
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
In the past decade , with the implementation of President Jiang Zemin 's instruction on " working hard to build revolutionized , modernized and regularized anti-chemical warfare units , " our country 's anti-chemical warfare units have basically formed a new fighting system marked by the new generation of " ordinance for anti-chemical warfare " and has achieved significant progress in solving major and difficult problems .  Our country has in the main formed a new type of anti-chemical warfare training system with a new generation of training program .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
As a result , the troops have achieved the purpose of learning to give self and mutual medical aid on the battle ground ; the exercise has reached a reliable theoretical basis for the troops in grasping and using troop disposition , board and lodging , and fighting and hiding of the squad to reduce to the maximum degree casualties of non-combat personnel for future operations in the lofty mountains and jungles ; and the achievement has filled gaps in the aspect of field survival for troops .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
Second , the US military may plan to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
The five kinds of spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin are a new development and summation of various kinds of lofty spirit that have emerged in a long process of the party 's cause of uniting with and fighting together with the people .  They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .  
The spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties and forging ahead relentlessly has encouraged us to continuously climb up to the summit despite hardship and danger with an indomitable and tenacious will and a heroic mettle of fighting unyieldingly and daring to win a victory .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
To turn the grand blueprint of the " 10th Five-Year " Plan into brilliant reality and to realize the objective of modernizing national defense and the armed forces , we need to vigorously promote the unremitting fighting spirit and always maintain an elated mental state .  
Therefore , for party organizations at all levels of our army , a most essential and most direct task in their implementation of " three represents " is to conscientiously implement the strategy of reinforcing the army and invigorating military training through science and technology , a strategy that has been put forward by the Central Military Commission ; strive to meet high standards in enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops ; pay close attention to training the troops through science and technology ;  
Taiwan has a definite advantage in such areas as capital , specialized talents , buying and selling of technologies , enterprise management , and international marketing .  Taiwan businessmen are also blessed with the special advantage of language and ethnicity and thus have many favorable conditions in fighting for a share in the mainland market and in seizing investment and trade opportunities .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
The mass troop trainings in science and technology are developing in breadth and depth , the research of key subjects like combined operation , electronic warfare , airstrike countermeasure , new " three hittings and three defenses , and so on have made new breakthroughs , the study of high-tech knowledge , cultivation of talented people , training in new equipment , and so on , have all acquired remarkable effects , thus the fighting capacity of troops being further improved .  
The development of large enterprises will be concentrated on increasing their abilities in exploitation and marketing , and that of small enterprises will be concentrated on raising their specialized level and ability in coordinating with the large enterprises , with a view to ultimately enabling the large , medium , and small enterprises to temper themselves in international markets in the form of a combined fleet rather than fighting single-handedly .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
The continual loss of resources of state authority and economic and fiscal resources supporting such authority resources makes the government 's command implementation mechanisms exist in name only , rendering the state totally incapable of fighting big entrenched benefit-distribution groups in society and criminal groups in society .  
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Developed countries , and even some developing countries , have invariably realized that a trial of strength in a future hi-tech war will first and foremost be a trial of strength over science and technology , and a comprehensive trial of strength over science and technology is , in the final analysis , competition over qualified personnel .  In a certain sense , it could be said that the outcome of today 's competition over qualified personnel will decide the outcome of tomorrow 's fighting on a battlefield .  
It is the belief in being brave and fighting and defeating competitors and the working style of persistent struggle that was created by our military a long time ago .  It is the teamwork characterized by aligning oneself with the interests of the entire situation and being cooperative .  
It was decided at the meeting that beginning from now till the end of next year , public security organs throughout the country should , in close conjunction with the fighting goal set by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on striving to achieve a conspicuous improvement in public order within two years , immediately launch a vigorous and forceful nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
As a result of this struggle , the people of all nationalities throughout the country have further formed the common aspiration that China must develop , the nation must be rejuvenated , and society must be stable ; and they have further formed staunch fighting spirit for rousing ourselves to vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous , making China strong , and boosting our national strength .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
Soon afterward , the army crossed the Chang Jiang to the south .  After a half year of arduous long-distance marching and fighting , it arrived in central Hunan where it fulfilled its mission of establishing an anti-Japanese base area centered around Heng Shan .  
Wei Jianxing expressed the hope that the broad masses of staff members and workers would take model workers as models , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , heighten their fighting spirit and work in a down-to-earth manner in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " and strenuously struggle to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized socialist modern country .  
In Wang Wei 's home , there is an unfinished oil painting : A future Chinese Navy air force pilot flies a fighting eagle fighter plane and soars into the blue sky of the motherland while a warship of a new model cleaves a boundless expanse of blue water and cruises in the territorial waters of the motherland . . .  
When he learned that there was no more hope for Wang Wei to return alive , elder Chen Yingming , chief senior aviation industrial artist of the China Aviation Museum who is over 70 years of age , decided to make with his own hands for Wang Wei a fighter plane model named the " Blood-and-Iron Fighter Plane , " and the model would look exactly the same as the fighting eagle piloted by Wang Wei before his death .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's spirit of being undaunted by the enemy , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to overwhelm all enemies ; and to learn from his combat style of continuing to toughening himself , fighting heroically and unyieldingly , and fighting a decisive battle to final victory .  The decision called on all officers and men to apply themselves to studying modern science and technology , to become skillful in using their weapons and equipment , and truly enhance their abilities to fight a defensive war under modern conditions .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
When inspecting the earthquake-stricken areas in Garze Zhang Autonomous Prefecture , Sichuan Province a few days ago , State Concillor Ismail Amat stressed : Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and with support of the people throughout China , the people of disaster areas heightened fighting spirit , worked cease lily and unremittingly , further strengthened ethnic unity , carried out reconstruction in disaster areas in a down-to-earth and effective manner , and won a comprehensive victory in earthquake relief work .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
In recent years , India has formulated a military strategy of " guarding against China northward , fighting against Pakistan westward , dominating the Indian Ocean southward , and expanding its sphere of influence eastward " in addition to its efforts to build nuclear deterrent power .  Expanding its sphere of influence eastward means extending its sphere of influence to the South China Sea and a part of the Pacific region .  
Not long ago , he even put forth a fairly provocative slogan of " fighting a decisive battle outside the territory " and repeatedly sought more and more advanced and offensive weapons .  Recently , when the purchase order of foreign weapons was finalized , he just could not hide being quite pleased with himself .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
By building a search and rescue center marked by a sound organization structure , flexible command decision-making , advanced search and rescue equipment , and high-quality search and rescue personnel , we will be able to provide strong support for fighting and winning a future war .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
In Beijing , in last night 's " News Network Show , " the CCTV unusually devoted three and a half minutes to snapshots of " large-scale drills " of the PLA , showing Su-27 fighters engaged in all-weather operations over inland , highland , and coastal areas and indicating that the new-generation fighters have developed full fighting capacity .  
and inspire all Communists and the people in their hundreds and millions , to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory ; rally more closely around the central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; adhere to the party 's basic line and program ; heighten fighting spirit ; forge ahead while constantly opening up new prospects in work ; and unremittingly struggle for the realization of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization in the new century .  
The work in all fields must aim at heightening fighting spirit , stimulating morale , unifying thinking , and rallying forces , and it must also aim at firmly grasping a correct orientation , promoting reform and development , and safeguarding social stability .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
In early 1999 , the PLA general departments decided to build through three stages and within three years this innovation project by following the train of thought for work : Ensuring unified leadership , formulating advance theories , testing results through practice , working out plans at the top level , and simultaneously building all arms and services , with an eye on introducing a new system of training content in light of the requirements for fighting and winning a local war under hi-tech conditions .  
Before being sworn in to office , President Chen had once put forth the idea of " fighting a decisive battle outside our territory . "  Whether or not this idea is realistically and strategically feasible , it has at least reflected the psychology shared by some fellow countrymen , who have all along hated , dodged , and rejected a war .  
18 percent felt that fierce political fighting led to weakening economic competitiveness ; 15 percent attributed it to the authorities ' ideological command and inability to take proper steps ; and 6 percent felt that people have not put in sufficient efforts .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
A few days ago , fighting eagles under the Air Force of the Guangzhou Military Region flew from two directions and assembled in a designated airspace in attack formations .  A new-type warplane moved strangely for harassment strikes while at the same time another fighting eagle flew with the maximal slope to the best offensive position , swiftly occupied a favorable position , turned its feint attack into the main attack , and was poised for an all-out attack .  
According to foreign reports , in order to realize this strategic objective , the Indian navy has already worked out an explicit plan : Around 2012 , Indian 's fighting force at sea will be formed by large and medium-sized more-advanced fighting vessels including three aircraft carriers and about 20 submarines with a total naval force of more than 100,000 troops .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
A year after a sharp change took place in the Taiwan Strait situation , Taiwan people built their own views and judgement on Taiwan authorities ' threats of " fighting a decisive war offshore " and " bombing the coastal cities on the west side of the strait " .  
They began another consecutive , intensified , night flight training exercise under bad weather conditions .  The training was based on the following scenario : They experienced defeats before .  They want to enhance their continuous fighting capability by improving their almost-real combat training .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
During flight training , the regiment ordered its personnel to train on a number of applied tactical topics under complicated meteorological conditions , trained its pilots in terms of will and endurance to the maximum extent , and assigned its pilots to fulfill during one flight combat missions that had previously taken two flights to accomplish , thus enhancing its pilots ' continuous fighting capabilities by a large margin .  
Thus rational and correct command decisions are bound to unleash powerful capability for a belligerent in winning a war with its existing fighting capacity , even under adverse circumstances .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .  
We must push forward " four innovations " with persistent efforts , namely , innovating in theories , contents , methods , and systems , and work hard to bring about a breakthrough in our military theories , operational guidance , and basic tactics .  We must energetically press ahead in an all-round way our activities of training troops through science and technology , and popularize and upgrade such activities as well .  In training our troops through science and technology , we must also work hard to translate achievements into fighting capacity .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
and they are troops that are fully trusted by the party and the people .  The vast number of cadres , and leading cadres in particular , must penetrate the grass-roots levels and the masses , and must serve the people wholeheartedly .  They must continue to embody " the old Tibetan spirit " of " being extremely arduous , full of fighting valor , patient , united , and contributory " so as to make new contributions for the prosperity and development of Tibet .  
Party organizations at all levels are urged to push forward the building of grassroots party organizations with an innovative mind , integrate in real terms the work of party building at the grassroots level with the reality of the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , take earnest steps to enhance the effectiveness of their work , and give better play to the role of grassroots party organizations as a strong fighting force ;  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
In the world 's great struggle against Fascism , in the sacred cause of the Asian , African and Latin American people fighting for national independence and liberation , and in the tireless efforts to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international order , we have always stood on the side of justice and worked in unity with the people of all countries and all the progressive forces in the world .  
Wang Tao , a leading scientist engaging in the study of the desertization process in northern China and the way to prevent and control the process who earned a doctoral degree in a foreign country , said : In his " 1 July " speech , Jiang Zemin pointed out the need to fully realize the great importance of fighting corruption and building a clean government , and to carry out to the end the work to build up the party style and promote clean government administration , as well as the struggle against corruption .  
In the study of the speech , efforts should be focused on studying and understanding the party 's basic experience , the scientific connotations of the important thinking on " three represents , " the requirement for strengthening and improving party building , and party 's historical tasks and fighting targets in the new century .  
It is necessary to carry forward the fine study style of linking theory with practice .  The study should be closely linked with the fighting course of the party , with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and in our country 's society , with the new things and new issues that we are facing in the work of party building .  The study of the speech should be combined with summing up work experience , solving problems , and promoting routine work .  
Second stage .  The three forces will cooperate in see crossing and landing operations , including simulated missile attacks , air assaults , night airborne raids , naval and ground forces occupying islands and launching sudden attacks , the special armed unit 's sudden attacks on ports or airports , and house-to-house fighting .  This reveals that the PLA 's island-attacking pattern has begun to change from " marine landings " into " airborne assaults . "  Under the new pattern , cracks troops rather than large numbers of troops will be sent to occupy important strategic points .  
You have been staunchly struggling against Western hostile forces and nationalistic separatist elements and winning major victories in quelling rebellious forces , suppressing bandits , and fighting back against the enemies in defending ourselves , thus effectively maintaining Tibet 's social stability and stability in Tibet 's border areas , and defending national sovereignty , territorial integrity , and ethnic unity .  You have been endeavoring to fulfill the fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people ;  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
You have been fulfilling the general demand of Chairman Jiang 's " five phrases " , meeting high standards , and completely improving the quality of the troops bearing in mind the historical mission of " fighting to win " and " maintaining the true qualities , " thus outstandingly accomplishing all tasks bestowed on you by the people , forging the veteran Tibetan spirit of " being particularly able to bear hardship , to fight , to endure , to remain united , and to dedicate yourselves , " and producing large numbers of advanced role models .  
Nevertheless , since it is hard to keep an alliance and public support unchanged for large-scale operations for a long time , in order to ensure a rapid and thorough victory over an enemy , the US ground force should , as it is suggested , rely on the support of an alliance , the team spirit displayed by combined or allied forces , and superior surprise offensive fighting capacity during a campaign . 
The US military maintains that in order to secure a victory in a ground offensive campaign , the US ground force should build mobile units capable of fighting and encircling an enemy in a vertical way .  
To cope with the situation as quickly as possible , the government should increase high-technology weapons , get rid of the thinking of symmetrical operations , change the current situation in which the army amounts to a higher proportion in the three armed forces , and implement as quickly as possible the tactic of downsized troops .  In this way , the situation in which outlays for personnel maintenance accounts for half the annual defense budget and eats up the military investment budget can be avoided and fighting capability will be intensified .  
The leader of the Taiwan authorities has called for " fighting an economic war " with the Mainland , while Annette Lu , the " grieving woman deep in the palace " and a die-hard " Taiwan independence " element , with an ulterior motive , has been trying to shift the blame on to others by attacking the mother mainland as having launched a planned economic war against Taiwan that has been generating a magnetic effect , which has been the cause of Taiwan 's economic recession .  
According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars . "  This strategy requires that the United States maintain at least 1.4-million troops on active service .  Even with such a massive army , the Pentagon has to admit , the United States can only undertake less than a half of the war tasks .  
These reporters visited almost all the companies and forward posts in the coastal and frontier areas of the country and sent out more than 400 news reports , zealously eulogizing frontier servicemen 's heroic achievements and mental outlook of fighting arduously and bravely making contributions .  Besides , these reports have vividly demonstrated the historically great changes in coastal and border defense and fully reflected the border areas ' new progress in army-government and army-people unity and material and spiritual civilizations .  
It also has a bearing on the rise or fall of the Chinese nation .  It will also determine whether or not our army can always become the effective tool to fulfill the Party 's political tasks under the new situation .  Therefore , to continuously arm our army with military equipment of advanced technology , enhance our army 's fighting power , and fulfill the Party 's highest political requirements in " fighting to win " should be our army 's basic task in upholding the Party 's absolute leadership over the army under the new situation .  
Efforts must be made to step up our efforts in carrying out reform in the army and strengthening army building .  We must continuously develop high technology in order to enhance fighting power by training more skilled professionals , improving military equipment , reforming the military structure , and carrying out major high-tech military drills .  All this is aimed at turning our army into a mighty army that will remain invincible in future warfare and live up to the expectation of our Party and the people .  
The broad ranks of veteran comrades have realized that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech delivered on 1 July contains rich contents and shows great foresight .  Besides systematically summing up our party 's 80-year basic experience and glorious course , the speech comprehensively expounded the important thinking of the " three represents " and further pointed out the historic task and fighting objective of the party in the new century .  
After the trials of training in high temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius and frigid cold of 30 degrees Celsius below zero ; after successively moving across Bohai , Donghai , Nanhai , and other sea areas ; after undergoing rigid training and roughing it out , the Navy Marines of our army have now found an operational program that is suitable for moving , eating , living , and fighting in all kinds of weathers and environments under the condition of modern warfare .  They have also mastered the skill of fighting in complicated regions .  
and attempted to sever the kinship forged with blood , which is thicker than water , between the people on two sides .  As if that is not enough , the Taiwan authorities have time and time again spent the hard-earned money of the general public in buying advanced weapons from abroad .  They advocate " fighting a decisive battle outside our borders " and wish to enter into a military alliance with the United States and Japan against the mainland .  
Together with Political Commissar Liu Shaoqi and other comrades , he reorganized the troops , summed up experience and lessons , strengthened party leadership and ideological and political building among the troops , and thus turned the New Fourth Army into an invincible anti-Japanese army fighting north and south of the Chang Jiang and striking terror into the enemy troops .  
We should learn from him his firm belief in pursuing truth and fighting all his life for the cause of the party and the people , his working spirit of daring to shoulder heavy responsibilities and working hard to attain first-rate achievements , his magnanimity in daring to dissect himself and treating comrades with sincerity , and his awe-inspiring integrity of upholding principle and being selfless and fearless , unite as one , go all out to forge ahead , and indefatigably fight for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics !  
At the training site , this reporter discovered that right after the fourth round of fighting ended , the " red unit " told the " blue unit " : You should have provided a smoke screen and smoke escort for your men when mounting an attack from different directions with small fighting groups .  In a new round of fighting , the " blue unit " learned a lesson from its mistakes and employed new tactics as well .  
Indeed , the regiment 's " red unit " and " blue unit " managed to refine each other 's tactics step by step during each round of fighting , by exposing each other 's loopholes , refining each other 's tactics , improving each other 's training plans , developing new tactics , and conducting training in light of a real war .  
The surface warship unit represents a backbone force of the Chinese Navy in carrying out defense strategic task on coastal waters .  It is also the earliest branch established by the Navy . The Chinese Navy has expanded its surface warship unit .  Now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .  
It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
Tung Chee-hwa said : Although we ran into some difficulties - - particularly the financial storm that swept across Asia - - after our reversion , the HKSAR government has taken resolute , daring , and effective measures in conjunction with the firm and persistent fighting spirit of the masses of residents to enable the HKSAR 's financial market to enjoy steady development and the entire economy to gradually move out of the trough and get back to the broad way of prosperity . 
At the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission held in the beginning of this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out : " The key to determining how well China can handle its current affairs lies in our party and depends on the party 's ideology , work style , discipline , organizational situation , fighting capacity and leadership level .

US Army General ( Greg Hackett ) announced on 4 April that in the next 20 years the US Army will spend $ 38 billion on procuring 1,213 RAH-66 Comanche armed helicopters ; this is the world 's first helicopter of high intelligence capacity , fully digitized and electronic ; it has good stealth capability , advanced electronic equipment , and a high degree of automation , with strong ground attack capability and relatively strong aerial fighting capability ;  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
We should make vigorous efforts to strengthen the building of political power at the grass-roots level in rural areas and turn them into strong fighting bastions to prevent and crack down on the criminal activities in abducting and trafficking in women and children .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that strengthening preparation for war [ zhan bei gong zuo ] , upgrading the high-tech and high-quality equipment of the armed forces , and making good preparation for properly fighting an " anti-Taiwan-independence " war and opposing hegemonic military intervention at any time are the principle for war preparation formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in accordance with the reality that the two sides of the strait are still in a state of war and hegemony has not stopped interfering in China 's internal affairs .  
On the other hand , the desire for peace , cooperation , and development has become an irresistible trend of the times .  The voice of the vast numbers of developing countries demanding dialogue and countering confrontation , safeguarding the purpose and principles of the UN Charter , and fighting against the use of human rights to meddle in the internal affairs of other countries , is running high .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that flood and drought have always been the serious hidden problems affecting China 's economic and social development and the people 's livelihood , and the impact of drought on agricultural production is particularly prominent .  All localities must firmly embrace the idea of fighting a major drought for a long time .  
Responsible person : Since the 14th Party Congress , propaganda work in newspapers and periodicals has achieved very good results in holding the banner aloft , maintaining unanimity , serving the overall situation , focusing on the central tasks , promoting reform and development , preserving social stability , singing the theme in a series of major propaganda tasks , fighting a successful battle of initiative , providing correct guidance , and performing in a lively and vigorous way ; it has thus created a very good public opinion atmosphere for reform , opening up , and modernization .  
Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
In the rural areas known for a serious problem of narcotics , we must make earnest efforts to include the ban on drug cultivation , drug trafficking , or drug abuse in both " the village rules and the regulations for farmers . "  We must employ effective measures suited to the local conditions , mobilize to the maximum extent the enthusiasm of the farmers and masses in fighting against drug-related crimes , and help implement the requirements for the narcotics control work at the grassroots level in an all-round way .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  They should further enhance the inspiring force , rally force , and fighting capacity of the ideological and political work .  
It is precisely because of the unceasing strengthening and improvement of its own development that the CPC has always maintained plentiful vitality and exuberant fighting spirit .  As a result , from a small party of a few dozen members early in the 20th century it gradually developed into a ruling party that had led the Chinese people in becoming masters of their own destiny .  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
The earliest military strategy of Taiwan based itself on " recovering the mainland . "  Finally , to face reality , Taiwan changed its strategy into fighting a " decisive war on the island , " the core of which was a " decisive battle on the beach and offshore ; " that is , " destroying the enemy forces at the waterfront and annihilating them on beachheads . "  
Its basic characteristic is the comprehensive use of various high-tech information technology [ IT ] developed in the 1990 ' s to conduct rapid , hidden , and destructive damage to the enemy 's military and civilian computer networks and communication systems , cutting off the enemy 's military contacts , disabling command , dowsing the fighting spirit , and bringing great chaos to the economy and society of the country concerned .  This will finally allow the attacking side to achieve the goal of striking the first blows without shedding a drop of blood .  
Moreover , since Taiwan bought advanced weapons from many countries and their quality , function , and operation procedures vary from country to country , the fire control system , electronic warfare system , and command control systems of the weapons are mostly uncoordinated or imperfect .  This has a direct bearing on the normal performance of the planes ' fighting function .  
He is really waiting for the ripe time to fulfill his second dream - - setting up a " Taiwan Republic . " To this end , he is ready to counter the CPC by force of arms , " fighting a decisive war with the CPC outside the borders . "  This has made the cross-strait situation more uncertain and has increased the possibility of a cross-strait war .  
Over 1,000 tanks , armored vehicles , infantry fighting vehicles , self-propelled rocket launchers , self-propelled gun-howitzers , carriage motor howitzers and antiaircraft guns traveled great distances to the site of the maneuver and lined up in a strong and orderly array .  
President Chen Shui-bian 's [ Chen Shui-bien 's ] idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " has not been mentioned in the report .  However , Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen emphasized in the foreword that the change of the strategic idea of the national troops to " effective deterrence and strong entrenchment " does not mean we are having an arms race with the Chinese communist troops .

But after 30 years as an ambassador I 've come to one conclusion about international relations : exhortations to another country about shared feelings , morality , and fighting the common enemy , while not completely useless , are certainly limited in effect ; what 's needed is a relationship of shared interests built on a realistic basis .  
A democratic government has been the goal which China has been long searching for in recent years , but after the Chinese Communists ' abrupt rise , the value of this democratic theory which is applicable everywhere has been muddled and its role confused under the fighting among the political parties of China .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
The KMT 's election broadcasts featured replays of old newsreels showing the DPP 's past street demonstrations and laid the charge against them of engaging in riotous politics . The DPP raised the KMT 's financial scandals to criticize them on counts of corruption and senility . The China Social Democratic Party 's 9-minute broadcast on the theme of growing up accused both parties of pointless fighting and asked where the people are who are going to plant seeds when " the robbers have all got their places . "  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
Seeing through " Huang Fei-hong the idol , " Peng Han-ping believes that the reason Bruce Lee was acknowledged as a hero was because he combined Chinese Wing Chun kungfu with Western fighting techniques to create his own " Stop Fist " kungfu , and his films display real martial arts skill ; to this day , they remain very valuable material for martial arts students to study . But Jet Li 's kungfu is just " display kungfu , " flashy and beautiful , but only good for brief entertainment .  
Yinfeng was left with two children less than ten years old . Women in similar situations rushed to remarry in order to meet their daily needs . Fate dictated that not long after the fighting between the Nationalists and Communists stopped , there was an enormous flood , which ruined the just-planted crops .  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
As the harmful effects of drugs came to be understood , drug trafficking changed from being legal to being a criminal offense around the world . There has been a significant trend toward international cooperation in fighting the drug trade . Producer , transshipment , and consumer nations have joined hands to clamp down at every link in the chain . Only in this way can narcotics activities be completely rooted out .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
He detested civil war , but led troops fighting in civil wars for over a decade ; he was eager to fight the Japanese , but failed when he did so ; he opposed communism half his life , but at the crucial juncture saved the communist party ; he was faithful to Chiang Kai-shek for years , yet while in the field rebelled and kidnapped Chiang , and in the end was kept locked up by Chiang for decades .  
The way this mainland wife was accepted by a traditional Taiwanese clan and has become chairperson of the management committee of their ancestral home , can be attributed not only to her seniority , unbending principles and utter selflessness , but also to her matchless warmhearted enthusiasm and indomitable fighting spirit .  
In the early years of the Republic of China , with constant fighting among the warlords , intellectuals wrote martial arts novels to amuse themselves , and magazine stories grew more and more decadent and extravagant , leading Lu Xun to describe them as " monstrous and evil at heart , and filled with descriptions of romance . " These works invited their urban readers to escape the painful realities of their lives .  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
Another factor was that in the wake of Pearl Harbor , there were only limited numbers of fit , potential conscripts left in Japan , and with the expansion of the Japanese lines from the Pacific to Southeast Asia , the tough , hardworking aboriginal youths , with their knack for fighting in forested mountain terrain , naturally became a priority consideration .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
" The biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says Tsao Chi-hung . " As more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . " The riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the East , the sunset in the West , and the dreamy river alongside the park .  
In such times , people naturally honor a wandering knight who kills on behalf of the powerless . Yuan Jiegang , a scholar of the early Republican era , described the waxing and waning of the knight-errant 's image as follows : Knights-errant were common people who had usurped the power to kill . This could not be tolerated by the imperial authorities . At its height , the Han dynasty sought to eliminate the knights-errant , and their fighting spirit was quickly broken .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
Chung Chiao , head of a drama company and also a judge for the poetry competition , analyzes the poems in terms of content : The Filipino poems subtly reveal the fervent culture of a tropical island colonized by the Spanish , a poetry filled with love of life and more socially conscious , because of the Filipino tradition of fighting for their rights ; Indonesian works tend to emphasize the micro details of human relationships , while the Vietnamese and Thai poems contain more advice and aphorisms .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
They range from familiar staples such as acupuncture , moxibustion , Chinese herbal medicine , qigong and shiatsu , to more exotic-sounding varieties such as homeopathy , magnetic healing and energetic medicine . ( Homeopathy is a traditional European treatment method in which the practitioner first diagnoses the patient 's symptoms , then prescribes tiny doses of drugs that in larger quantities would elicit the same symptoms . The drug 's affinity for the disease boosts the body 's own defense mechanisms . This is similar to the Chinese principle of " fighting poison with poison . " )  
In Hero , Zhang Yimou similarly emphasized symbolic , highly visualized fighting sequences . One example is the fight scene at the chess pavilion between Jet Li and Donnie Yen . Here , the fighting is an exhibition of the martial arts aesthetic and of a skill so consummate that the combatants themselves are able to determine the outcome from just a few preliminary passes .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
The odd thing is that precisely because Taiwan 's public health system was so successful in the past-because the " enemy " had been defeated in every battle-people became inattentive to public health . As time went on , frontline public health personnel neglected their training and lost completely their fighting edge .  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
The Taiwan Minpao carried many excerpts from the notebooks that Chiang kept in prison . From them we can see that he not only made friends with gangsters , but was quite interested in the culture and language of their world , and planned to produce a dictionary of gangster lingo after coming out of prison . At the same time , he was deeply pained by the way the gangsters wasted their courage on fighting against their guards , frequently being injured and growing weak and dispirited as a result .  
In 1915 , following the " Tafen Incident , " Aliman and his elder brother took to the hills to resist the Japanese authorities . Pursued by the Japanese police , the two fraternal heroes led fellow Bunun across peaks and precipices southwestward along the upper reaches of the Laonung River , finally reaching Yusui , hidden deep in harsh protective terrain . There they set up their base and carried on fighting against the Japanese police for more than a decade . Members of many different Aboriginal tribes , moved by their example , joined them .  
After the workshop concluded , the members went on to form the Wenshan Neovista Association , launching a series of talks , fighting for funding , planning the renovation effort , getting the opinions of local residents , and construction companies involved in the effort . After three years of hard work , they finally completed the project . Soon after completion the college opened the hall with a series of art and literature activities , using it to pass on the area 's rich art and culture .  
This lowered his morale . Due to these frustrations , there was a time when Wang considered giving up . But then he considered his original vow to help , and also how he himself had had discipline problems in school : fighting , bullying , low grades . The affirmation and care he received then from his church elders guided him out .  
Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .

In my initial reaction to the letter , I expressed my profound regret at the decision by the Croatian Government , as I strongly believe that the United Nations played a decisive role in bringing to a halt the brutal war on Croatian soil three years ago , and that UNPROFOR has since helped prevent a resumption of renewed fighting .  
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
The facilitation of mutually beneficial joint economic projects to improve living conditions in central and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina has helped to lay a foundation of confidence and trust among a population that had previously witnessed some of the most intense fighting in the present conflict .

In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
Oman , like the rest of the international community , accepts neither this new escalation of fighting by attacking United Nations peace-keepers nor the status quo prevailing in those safe areas which recently became subject to the policy of ethnic cleansing .  
This increase took place particularly in places close to the scene of intensified fighting and reflected the growing inability of both rural and urban populations to cope with the daily problems caused by the fighting , the collapse of social services and the unstable economic situation .  
The alleged perpetrators include clandestine organizations which , while claiming to be fighting against crime and impunity , have been responsible for threats of this kind , have thwarted investigations of crimes against human rights , caused the resignation of public prosecutors in high-profile cases and intimidated relatives and prospective new victims . 
It is astonishing to note that the Government and people of Lebanon , who are fighting to liberate their territory from prolonged foreign occupation an inherent and inalienable right recognized by international law and enshrined in the United Nations Charter are called upon to give up their right to self-defence and hence submit to aggression , occupation , and non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
We also support the decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism and punishing its perpetrators , as terrorism has become a dangerous international phenomenon that has taken the lives of many innocent people , destroyed the infrastructure of many countries , disrupted tourism and the free movement of innocent people and defamed national liberation and independence movements .  
As a result of the heavy bombardment of the capital by the Taliban on 26 November 1995 , the Secretary-General expressed his concern about the escalation of fighting and called upon all parties to cooperate with the efforts of the United Nations Special Mission , then headed by Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri , aimed at achieving an immediate ceasefire and promoting negotiations among the parties on a transitional mechanism for the transfer of power , to achieve a just and durable settlement acceptable to all Afghans .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation requests the heads of diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations to report objectively about what they have seen to the Governments , nations or organizations that they represent and give them an accurate account of what is taking place in Burundi : recognized crimes against innocent populations , women , children and defenceless patients can not be mistaken for a struggle for democracy or the liberation of an ethnic group , or presented simply as inter-ethnic confrontation or fighting between the army and the rebels .  
The cease-fire broke down on 29 April when an attempted meeting of the Council of State , attended by Chairman Sankawulo together with Councilmen Taylor and Kromah , was cut short after fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and NPFL / ULIMO-K forces near the executive mansion .  NULLThe fighting rapidly escalated overnight into some of the worst fighting witnessed since the start of the civil war in December 1989 .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
Throughout the country , inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government are major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance and thus slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of tragedy in other areas .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
If steps are not taken to curb the fighting , then the current situation in the West Bank , which has turned into a grim confrontation between organized forces , may do immeasurable damage to the already shaky efforts for a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
A subject of utmost concern to the Special Committee was the Israeli decision to open an archaeological tunnel beneath the Temple Mount , which had been viewed as a grave provocation by Muslims throughout the world and had sparked the worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians since the beginning of the peace process , in which the Israeli army had responded with excessive force and incursions into the self-rule areas under exclusive Palestinian control .  
In the same way , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Rwanda stated ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 7 ) that the genocide of the Tutsis , the massacres of moderate Hutus and the renewed fighting in the civil war which followed were marked by many grave violations of international humanitarian law .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Despite strenuous diplomatic efforts , in particular by the Secretary-General and his special representative , Mr . Nobert Holl , to broker a ceasefire and engage the warring parties in a peace process , the fighting has been raging unabated , with even greater intensity in recent months . 
While the warring parties have shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it is noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans have taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who are not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
In that connection , he cited the numerous initiatives that had been undertaken by the President of Tunisia , Mr . Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and his continuing efforts to promote peace in Africa . Tunisia called upon the parties concerned to halt the fighting and re-establish peace , and invited international and regional organizations to provide assistance to the victims in order to avert a tragedy that would affect the entire African continent . 
The Secretary-General added , however , that while the warring parties had shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it was noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans had taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who were not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
Inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government remained major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance , slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of crisis conditions in others .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
The rural population , especially in and around the areas of the two principal front lines , has experienced numerous and severe hardships as a result of the fighting which were often compounded by inclement weather .  
Direct consequences of this fighting are the continuing massive loss of human life , killing , refugee flows , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive economic destruction .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
They stated that an enabling political and policy framework was required , for example , with regard to political and economic stability , intellectual property rights and an adequate legal framework , and fighting corruption .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
It expressed its grave concern over the situation of anarchy prevailing in the Comorian Island of Anjouan and the humanitarian problems caused by the fighting which broke out between opposing factions within the separatist movement .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
Those remaining are mostly territorial troops engaged in civil duties , such as voluntary public works in agriculture , construction , irrigation , fighting illiteracy , building churches , roads and bridges , helping the social welfare of villagers , etc .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .  
The members of the Council expressed concern over the sporadic renewal of fighting , and called on all parties to halt military operations , respect international humanitarian law and facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to affected populations .  
The chronic fighting and the resultant political uncertainty has exacerbated the human misery of innocent Afghan people , who have already suffered for too long and are the real victims of this endless war .  
The objectives of the Government in oil refining are : to increase lubrication oil production to meet overall local demand ; to improve the quality of refined products by reducing sulphur contents in gas oil and kerosene and the necessity for lead compounds in gasoline ; to improve safety standards and fire - fighting capabilities ; to improve environmental protection by enhanced treatment to effluent water and gas emissions ; and to increase operating efficiency in general .  
Despite an increasing awareness of the problem , however , many refugees were once again exposed to cross-border attacks , forced recruitment into armed fighting forces and confinement in remote , isolated and perilously located camps .  
The same difficulty resurfaces in the relationship between economic adjustment programmes , on the one hand , and social or environmental goals such as fighting poverty , providing basic education or health , offering a safety net for the unemployed and protecting tropical forests , on the other . 
To help bring this issue to a just and lasting resolution , the Chinese Government offers encouragement and support to the conflicting parties in Afghanistan so that they can put the interests of their nation and country above everything else , disregard their ethnic , religious and political differences , stop fighting among themselves as soon as possible and establish a broad-based and stable government acceptable to all sides , on the basis of mutual respect and extensive consultations .  
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
Through these multifaceted but integrated activities , UNCTAD should contribute to ensuring the overall coherence of the global economic system and to making it more conducive to fighting poverty , reducing inequality within and among nations , protecting the right of present and future generations to the preservation of the environment , integrating women on an equal basis , generating employment and integrating the marginalized fully into the global economy .  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,  
By actively participating in the preparatory process for the special session on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit , my Government would like to contribute to achieving our common goals in fighting poverty , creating productive jobs and making a stable , safe and just society for all .  
While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the difficulties that the concerned Governments face in fighting armed insurgent groups , she notes with concern that in some countries Governments have adopted counter-insurgency strategies , often involving excessive and indiscriminate use of force , aimed at targeting those suspected of being members , collaborators or sympathizers of those groups , leading to further violations of the right to life .  
They also trained the Kamajor paramilitary troops who are fighting the rebel forces of the overthrown Government with the acquiescence of the current Government and are responsible for grave human rights violations against prisoners and the civilian population .  
Reforms in this area have supported the Triennial Reconstruction Plan , which focuses on revitalizing the national economy , rehabilitating basic infrastructures , controlling inflation , fighting corruption and unemployment and protecting property and personal safety .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Concluding asset-sharing arrangements as a means of enabling forfeited proceeds of crime to be used to strengthen the capacity of national criminal justice systems and contributing a part of such proceeds to programmes such as those aimed at enhancing national capacities for fighting crime in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , paying due consideration to the rights of bona fide third parties ;  
While the Dayton Agreement stopped the fighting and the most egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , underlying issues were to a large extent left to the parties to resolve among themselves on the basis of the Dayton principles .  
He noted that the recent upsurge in transnational crime had resulted in the penetration of central Asia by criminal groups and that the development of effective legislative frameworks and legal mechanisms for fighting crime had become a priority of the new sovereign States in that area .  
Her Government was committed to fighting poverty , inter alia by promoting the education and health of girls , enhancing their participation in the management of natural resources , improving their living conditions , combating violence against women , increasing their participation in decision-making and improving synergy among the relevant mechanisms for advancing the status of women .  
During the past six months , fighting continued in south Lebanon and the situation in the area remained volatile , although the level of hostility was somewhat reduced and civilian casualties decreased .  
In the light of the intensifying fighting and the worsening humanitarian situation , I decided to convene a meeting of the six plus two group on 15 September at the level of foreign ministers .  
It is equally intolerable that the intense fighting is hindering the access of humanitarian agencies to many regions , particularly the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , depriving vulnerable populations of the precious assistance they so sorely need .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
To further assist in fighting international organized crime , I am pleased to inform the Council that the official inauguration of the Sarajevo national Interpol office , established with considerable UNMIBH assistance , will take place next week .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
Mines and other sources of natural wealth are remote and heavily guarded , often located in areas subject to outbreaks of fighting or armed attacks against the local population .  
The recent surge in these activities by Pakistan , however , is a mere supplement to its widespread presence in Afghanistan , as Pakistan maintains thousands of military personnel , non-commissioned officers , armed nationals belonging to numerous Pakistan-based extremist organizations and volunteers from religious schools called the Madrassa , fighting alongside the Taliban mercenaries .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .  
Finally , blurred lines between the civilian and military character of camps expose civilians inside to the risk of attack by opposing forces , where camps are perceived to serve as launching pads for renewed fighting .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
The situation of military detentions by KFOR is based on rather more obscure legal grounds . 9 The Special Representative is informed that KFOR routinely arrests and detains individuals on an extrajudicial basis , mostly ethnic Albanians suspected of fighting in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia , citing resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and customary international law as the legal sources of KFOR authority for detentions . 
The draft Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons through various measures on the national , regional and international levels , and the follow-up mechanisms has established a solid basis for the international community and is a first step towards fighting the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
The majority of those in academic circles who dealt with the issue of terrorism shared the opinion that terrorism meant the following : the use of or threat to use violence for political purposes ; a method of fighting or reaching specific goals based on intimidation of a society and government by causing human casualties and loss of property , characterized by ruthlessness and violation of moral and legal norms .  
It is reported that the two ethnic groups living in the Ituri region , Hema and Lendu , have been in rivalry for a long time , fighting for land resources and the like .  In recent months , there have been continuous mass armed clashes , causing tremendous casulty and losses .  
In Sichuan Province , the secretary of the provincial party committee and the governor have assumed full responsibility for improving the style of the party , building a clean and honest government , and fighting against corruption .  They have divided this year 's anti-corruption work into 10 major tasks and 36 specific tasks .  The organization department of the provincial party committee , the provincial planning commission , the provincial financial department and 20 other units are taking lead in fighting against corruption and implementing various measures at their own and related departments and units .  
Wen Jiabao suggested organizing all Party leading cadres to seriously study the important speech made by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , deeply carrying out the spirit of the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , working in line with the actual condition of the financial sector , setting up specific measures and taking practical actions to carry forward improving the Party ï¿½s work style and building a clean and honest government and fighting corruption within the financial sector .  
For months , the officers and men - fighting with the stormy waves , keeping away from hidden reefs and crossing island chains deep down the ocean - had been exploring the way in unfamiliar waters , venturing into " deadly sea areas , " and struggling with Pacific storms .  Deep down the " Dragon King 's palace , " they set a new long voyage record in the history of conventional submarines .  
Third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .  We should carry out a special task to reform organizations and consolidate those people who have not been recruited in accordance with regulations and who are not suitable for their jobs .  In this way , we can continuously strengthen the invigoration and fighting capacity of the contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  
We must persist in treating war tasks as our ultimate tasks and firmly establish the thought of " doing military construction for future wars . "  In the construction of headquarters , we must truly put the emphasis on winning local wars under the condition of modern technology , especially high technology .  We must strive to improve our military 's ability in planning and directing military construction as well as in organizing and directing troops in fighting .  
They must conform to the requirements of the " Guidelines " and the directives of Party committees , chief officers and higher-level headquarters .  They must strengthen their planning , leadership , urgency and checks and ensure that construction in all aspects is implemented .  They must lay a firm foundation for improving our military 's ability in defense and fighting under modern situations and for striving to promote the transcentury development of the construction of military modernization .  
During the discussion , officers and men reviewed the army 's glorious history in fighting the people 's war , defeating the strong by the weak , and defeating the superior by the inferior .  They spoke glowingly of the army 's tremendous achievements in revolutionization , modernization , and regularization and reaffirmed their confidence of winning the regional war under the high-tech condition .  
The party committees and governments at all levels , the population , resources and environmental departments , as well as relevant departments should fully understand the extreme importance and arduousness of this work , firmly cultivate the ideology of " fighting a protracted battle , " overcome the blindly optimistic , careless and lax sentiments , and persist in grasping this work with unremitting efforts .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
All sorts of feelings welled up in the mind of deputy Zhu Wenquan at the mention of units ' particular ability to endure hardship , special proficiency in combat , and combat style of stubborn and heroic fighting , fearing no sacrifice ; he recalled how he had led his units to take part in a combined exercise , saying : " We traveled from our barracks to the exercise ground without suffering one casualty or having one vehicle overturning , and completely fulfilled our mission .  
Deputy Zhang Miansheng , an instructor of a certain unit of Guangzhou Military Region , fully agreed with what deputy Zhu Wenquan said : " Whether it is military exercises , or the fight against flood in 1998 , they expressed the interests of the state and people ; ours is an invincible iron army that dares to fight tough battles , is skilled in ferocious fighting , and fears no bloodshed or sacrifice . "  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
Under this circumstance , how do we prevent the United Nations from being swept to one side again ; how do we make the relations between big nations remain " unbroken amid fighting " ; and how do we conduct peacekeeping missions , under the auspices or with the approval of this major international organization , in a more cautious manner and on a more rationale scale , are " complicated arts " that need to be studied .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The basic purpose of this " three stresses " positive education among all army 's Party organizations is through centralized and general education to practically strengthen grass-roots Party organizations ' cohesive force and combat capability , enhance Party members ' political steadfastness and ethical purity , bring into full play the grass-roots Party organizations ' role of fighting force and the exemplary vanguard role of the Party members , and further consolidate foundations of the Party 's absolute leadership over the army .  
conducted education and training with strenuous efforts , established and improved various forms of educational and training systems , and continuously raised the political and professional qualities and legal awareness of policemen , thereby effectively improving the fighting capacity of the public security force .  
Particularly , the activities of national separatist organizations are getting brisker and brisker .  These organizations manage to sell weapons and narcotics , train terrorists , and even stand for fighting a " holy war . "  Their terrorist and violent nature has become conspicuous with each passing day , thus seriously threatening the regional peace and stability as well as the people 's life and property safety .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
He said : " The Zhoushan garrison is a heroic unit with glorious traditions ; during the war years it swept through the length and breadth of the land , fighting in the north and south ; it fought many tough and victorious battles , and a large number of heroic units and meritorious models emerged such as the ' Luoyang battalion ' and the famous combat heroes Lin Maocheng and Guo Jisheng .  
Only if the problems of each system , each subject and each battle line are solved in a deep and detailed manner and if our fighting capacities are strengthened , only then can the entire army be propelled to prepare for military battles on a deeper and more solid basis and the army can honor the sacred mission assigned by the Party and state at any time .  
This opera taps the glorious culture of the Chinese nation , playing up our grand style of supporting correctness and eradicating evil , and extolling our traditional aesthetic of readily helping others and boldly fighting for justice , to be completely in the key spirit of the " progressive orientation of advanced Chinese culture " as stated by President Jiang Zemin in his pithy statement on the " three representatives or typicals " of Party building on his investigation tour of Guangdong .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .  
" Eliminating pornography and fighting illegal publications " is a matter of social stability , of the physical and mental health of our young , of economic order , and of our international image .  The struggle needs to be looked at from a political point of view , and it needs a great deal of emphasis .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Only with such " background color " can they face the windy and snowy plateau with smiles ; can they " live through difficulties to an extraordinary degree , withstand hardships to an extraordinary degree , be competent in fighting to an extraordinary degree , and be enterprising to an extraordinary degree " ;  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
During the visit , both sides signed six agreements including a petrochemical base cooperation project worth $ 6 billion and a coal mine fire fighting project .  The agreements inject new vitality into the two countries ' economic and trade cooperation and will produce a major and deep impact on the two countries ' long-term cooperation .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
Amid a wave of criticisms , Tang Yao-ming , chief of the general staff of the Taiwan military , had no choice but to hold an urgent news conference on 7 July . Using fallacious reasoning , he claimed : The so-called " fighting a decisive battle offshore " is very different in meaning from " fighting an offshore decisive battle " .  
Fujian has promulgated and put into effect the " Fujian Management Regulations for Coastal Shipping , Border Defense , and Public Security " , setting up a " top official " leadership responsibility system for fighting illegal emigration , for a harsh crackdown by law on snake-heads and human smugglers .  And it has set up an exclusive snake-head crackdown taskforce , engaging in " online snake-head arrests " , all of which steps show Fujian 's firm stand and resolve against illegal emigration .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
Statistical data from a battlefield showed that , after a tank crew have stayed in a small and closed space for a long time where it is filled with various kinds of radiation , waste gases , electromagnetic waves , heat , and noises , tank speed reduced by 19 percent , time to complete shooting increased by 35 percent , miss-hitting increased by 4 percent , and , in real-combat exercises , their fighting capacity declined by 7 to 10 percent everyday .  
It can be said that , it is precisely because of the effective control provided by information that the strike weapons ' efficacy has been raised alarmingly high , that information has become a tool to redouble the fighting power , and that war has turned from large-scaled destruction and even total annihilation of the opponent in the traditional sense of the word into controlled precision strikes , into controllable strikes of the smallest number and best optimization to attain the greatest combat efficiency .  
At dawn , this reporter found at the mouth of the mountain , which was known as " Xiyangkou " , that the " special assault group " members , who had engaged in fierce fighting overnight and had broken through a defensive zone guarded closely by the " enemy " forces , which was as long as 35 kilometers , had become exhausted and had bloody cuts on their faces and hands .  
Behind the tough talk about successfully fighting two modern wars is reflected the hollow essence of the Americans in bullying the weak with strength and bullying the weak but fearing the strong .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of fighting with firepower and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war by fighting with firepower .  
In view of the some 100 specialties that had emerged under the new structure , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee focused their attention on a " combined capability " which proved to be a key link in the generation of fighting capacity , and issued a " written pledge " : Vying with one another to become " an expert in making a combined use of weapons " in studies , research , training , appraisals , and military exercises .  
When the fighting entered the decisive stage , our armored troops , which had driven through snowy mountains , icy paths , marshland , and obstacles , suddenly pounced on the " enemy troops " , which were paradropped .  In this way , the " enemy 's " attempt to attack us from the front and the rear simultaneously was foiled .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
It means fighting an active battle well , walking ahead of the masses , and guiding the masses to overcome interference and make correct options under very complex and complicated environments .  
This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
The breeding and spread of corrupt practices have severely weakened the unifying force and the fighting capacity of our party , and have disrupted the smooth progress of the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
In order to increase their large-scale airdropping and fighting capability and their capability to make surprise attacks on the ground with motor-driven firepower , they have made a series of bold attempts in airdropping heavy equipment .  They have succeeded in several dozen experiments in airdropping command cars , large trucks , fuel tankers , and cannons , thus properly solving crucial technical problems in loading , tying down , dropping , releasing , buffering and preventing toppling over upon landing , of large equipment .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
Guangzhou Military Area Command devoted firm and resolute effort to formulating fighting strength and logistic supply abilities on the basis of military units as a whole .  This measure focused on the crucial point in the current construction of fighting strength throughout the military .  It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria .  
Faced with the most vicious aggressors who were armed to the teeth and under the circumstances of fighting an extremely brutal war , the officers and men of our army fought in a dauntless-heroism spirit of conquering all enemy and all difficulties .  They crossed ice-covered lands , slept on snow-covered areas , fought a bloody battle , and smashed the myth that the US army was unconquerable .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
In accordance with the requirements laid down in its five-year program , the division 's party committee has divided fighting capacity building into four major aspects , namely , political work , military work , logistical support , and equipment and technical support ; has tackled bottlenecks which prevent new-type equipment from turning into all-round fighting capacity by focusing on key and thorny issues ; and has laid a solid foundation step by step .  
The division has also gradually established and refined through constant explorations an operational application system , a cadre and backbone training system , a training and support system , and a comprehensive assessment system , and has thus brought about profound changes for essential elements of fighting capacity in each and every aspect and enhanced its all-round operational capability by a large margin .  
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
In the past decade , with the implementation of President Jiang Zemin 's instruction on " working hard to build revolutionized , modernized and regularized anti-chemical warfare units , " our country 's anti-chemical warfare units have basically formed a new fighting system marked by the new generation of " ordinance for anti-chemical warfare " and has achieved significant progress in solving major and difficult problems .  Our country has in the main formed a new type of anti-chemical warfare training system with a new generation of training program .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
As a result , the troops have achieved the purpose of learning to give self and mutual medical aid on the battle ground ; the exercise has reached a reliable theoretical basis for the troops in grasping and using troop disposition , board and lodging , and fighting and hiding of the squad to reduce to the maximum degree casualties of non-combat personnel for future operations in the lofty mountains and jungles ; and the achievement has filled gaps in the aspect of field survival for troops .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
Second , the US military may plan to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
The five kinds of spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin are a new development and summation of various kinds of lofty spirit that have emerged in a long process of the party 's cause of uniting with and fighting together with the people .  They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .  
The spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties and forging ahead relentlessly has encouraged us to continuously climb up to the summit despite hardship and danger with an indomitable and tenacious will and a heroic mettle of fighting unyieldingly and daring to win a victory .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
To turn the grand blueprint of the " 10th Five-Year " Plan into brilliant reality and to realize the objective of modernizing national defense and the armed forces , we need to vigorously promote the unremitting fighting spirit and always maintain an elated mental state .  
Therefore , for party organizations at all levels of our army , a most essential and most direct task in their implementation of " three represents " is to conscientiously implement the strategy of reinforcing the army and invigorating military training through science and technology , a strategy that has been put forward by the Central Military Commission ; strive to meet high standards in enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops ; pay close attention to training the troops through science and technology ;  
Taiwan has a definite advantage in such areas as capital , specialized talents , buying and selling of technologies , enterprise management , and international marketing .  Taiwan businessmen are also blessed with the special advantage of language and ethnicity and thus have many favorable conditions in fighting for a share in the mainland market and in seizing investment and trade opportunities .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
The mass troop trainings in science and technology are developing in breadth and depth , the research of key subjects like combined operation , electronic warfare , airstrike countermeasure , new " three hittings and three defenses , and so on have made new breakthroughs , the study of high-tech knowledge , cultivation of talented people , training in new equipment , and so on , have all acquired remarkable effects , thus the fighting capacity of troops being further improved .  
The development of large enterprises will be concentrated on increasing their abilities in exploitation and marketing , and that of small enterprises will be concentrated on raising their specialized level and ability in coordinating with the large enterprises , with a view to ultimately enabling the large , medium , and small enterprises to temper themselves in international markets in the form of a combined fleet rather than fighting single-handedly .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
The continual loss of resources of state authority and economic and fiscal resources supporting such authority resources makes the government 's command implementation mechanisms exist in name only , rendering the state totally incapable of fighting big entrenched benefit-distribution groups in society and criminal groups in society .  
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
The delegation also held special report sessions on " opposing evil cult , guaranteeing human rights " for Chinese students studying in France and for overseas Chinese living and working in France . During its visit , the delegation also met with leaders of the French official and non-governmental anti-cult organizations and leaders of the French religious circles .  Both sides expressed their willingness to increase exchanges on the experience of investigating and fighting evil cults in the future .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Developed countries , and even some developing countries , have invariably realized that a trial of strength in a future hi-tech war will first and foremost be a trial of strength over science and technology , and a comprehensive trial of strength over science and technology is , in the final analysis , competition over qualified personnel .  In a certain sense , it could be said that the outcome of today 's competition over qualified personnel will decide the outcome of tomorrow 's fighting on a battlefield .  
It is the belief in being brave and fighting and defeating competitors and the working style of persistent struggle that was created by our military a long time ago .  It is the teamwork characterized by aligning oneself with the interests of the entire situation and being cooperative .  
It was decided at the meeting that beginning from now till the end of next year , public security organs throughout the country should , in close conjunction with the fighting goal set by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on striving to achieve a conspicuous improvement in public order within two years , immediately launch a vigorous and forceful nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
As a result of this struggle , the people of all nationalities throughout the country have further formed the common aspiration that China must develop , the nation must be rejuvenated , and society must be stable ; and they have further formed staunch fighting spirit for rousing ourselves to vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous , making China strong , and boosting our national strength .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
Soon afterward , the army crossed the Chang Jiang to the south .  After a half year of arduous long-distance marching and fighting , it arrived in central Hunan where it fulfilled its mission of establishing an anti-Japanese base area centered around Heng Shan .  
Wei Jianxing expressed the hope that the broad masses of staff members and workers would take model workers as models , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , heighten their fighting spirit and work in a down-to-earth manner in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " and strenuously struggle to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized socialist modern country .  
In Wang Wei 's home , there is an unfinished oil painting : A future Chinese Navy air force pilot flies a fighting eagle fighter plane and soars into the blue sky of the motherland while a warship of a new model cleaves a boundless expanse of blue water and cruises in the territorial waters of the motherland . . .  
When he learned that there was no more hope for Wang Wei to return alive , elder Chen Yingming , chief senior aviation industrial artist of the China Aviation Museum who is over 70 years of age , decided to make with his own hands for Wang Wei a fighter plane model named the " Blood-and-Iron Fighter Plane , " and the model would look exactly the same as the fighting eagle piloted by Wang Wei before his death .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's spirit of being undaunted by the enemy , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to overwhelm all enemies ; and to learn from his combat style of continuing to toughening himself , fighting heroically and unyieldingly , and fighting a decisive battle to final victory .  The decision called on all officers and men to apply themselves to studying modern science and technology , to become skillful in using their weapons and equipment , and truly enhance their abilities to fight a defensive war under modern conditions .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
When inspecting the earthquake-stricken areas in Garze Zhang Autonomous Prefecture , Sichuan Province a few days ago , State Concillor Ismail Amat stressed : Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and with support of the people throughout China , the people of disaster areas heightened fighting spirit , worked cease lily and unremittingly , further strengthened ethnic unity , carried out reconstruction in disaster areas in a down-to-earth and effective manner , and won a comprehensive victory in earthquake relief work .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
In recent years , India has formulated a military strategy of " guarding against China northward , fighting against Pakistan westward , dominating the Indian Ocean southward , and expanding its sphere of influence eastward " in addition to its efforts to build nuclear deterrent power .  Expanding its sphere of influence eastward means extending its sphere of influence to the South China Sea and a part of the Pacific region .  
Not long ago , he even put forth a fairly provocative slogan of " fighting a decisive battle outside the territory " and repeatedly sought more and more advanced and offensive weapons .  Recently , when the purchase order of foreign weapons was finalized , he just could not hide being quite pleased with himself .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
By building a search and rescue center marked by a sound organization structure , flexible command decision-making , advanced search and rescue equipment , and high-quality search and rescue personnel , we will be able to provide strong support for fighting and winning a future war .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
In Beijing , in last night 's " News Network Show , " the CCTV unusually devoted three and a half minutes to snapshots of " large-scale drills " of the PLA , showing Su-27 fighters engaged in all-weather operations over inland , highland , and coastal areas and indicating that the new-generation fighters have developed full fighting capacity .  
and inspire all Communists and the people in their hundreds and millions , to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory ; rally more closely around the central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; adhere to the party 's basic line and program ; heighten fighting spirit ; forge ahead while constantly opening up new prospects in work ; and unremittingly struggle for the realization of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization in the new century .  
The work in all fields must aim at heightening fighting spirit , stimulating morale , unifying thinking , and rallying forces , and it must also aim at firmly grasping a correct orientation , promoting reform and development , and safeguarding social stability .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
In early 1999 , the PLA general departments decided to build through three stages and within three years this innovation project by following the train of thought for work : Ensuring unified leadership , formulating advance theories , testing results through practice , working out plans at the top level , and simultaneously building all arms and services , with an eye on introducing a new system of training content in light of the requirements for fighting and winning a local war under hi-tech conditions .  
Before being sworn in to office , President Chen had once put forth the idea of " fighting a decisive battle outside our territory . "  Whether or not this idea is realistically and strategically feasible , it has at least reflected the psychology shared by some fellow countrymen , who have all along hated , dodged , and rejected a war .  
18 percent felt that fierce political fighting led to weakening economic competitiveness ; 15 percent attributed it to the authorities ' ideological command and inability to take proper steps ; and 6 percent felt that people have not put in sufficient efforts .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
A few days ago , fighting eagles under the Air Force of the Guangzhou Military Region flew from two directions and assembled in a designated airspace in attack formations .  A new-type warplane moved strangely for harassment strikes while at the same time another fighting eagle flew with the maximal slope to the best offensive position , swiftly occupied a favorable position , turned its feint attack into the main attack , and was poised for an all-out attack .  
According to foreign reports , in order to realize this strategic objective , the Indian navy has already worked out an explicit plan : Around 2012 , Indian 's fighting force at sea will be formed by large and medium-sized more-advanced fighting vessels including three aircraft carriers and about 20 submarines with a total naval force of more than 100,000 troops .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
A year after a sharp change took place in the Taiwan Strait situation , Taiwan people built their own views and judgement on Taiwan authorities ' threats of " fighting a decisive war offshore " and " bombing the coastal cities on the west side of the strait " .  
They began another consecutive , intensified , night flight training exercise under bad weather conditions .  The training was based on the following scenario : They experienced defeats before .  They want to enhance their continuous fighting capability by improving their almost-real combat training .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
During flight training , the regiment ordered its personnel to train on a number of applied tactical topics under complicated meteorological conditions , trained its pilots in terms of will and endurance to the maximum extent , and assigned its pilots to fulfill during one flight combat missions that had previously taken two flights to accomplish , thus enhancing its pilots ' continuous fighting capabilities by a large margin .  
Thus rational and correct command decisions are bound to unleash powerful capability for a belligerent in winning a war with its existing fighting capacity , even under adverse circumstances .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .

Nevertheless , since it is hard to keep an alliance and public support unchanged for large-scale operations for a long time , in order to ensure a rapid and thorough victory over an enemy , the US ground force should , as it is suggested , rely on the support of an alliance , the team spirit displayed by combined or allied forces , and superior surprise offensive fighting capacity during a campaign .

According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars .

People of religious circles expressed one after another their positive response and pledged to firmly support activities of " fighting against heretical cults by religious circles , " eradicating evil things , discarding the false and retaining the true , and making contributions to cutting out the tumor of the " Falungong cult and creating an auspicious , peaceful and happy society .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the important " three represents " idea study and education activities being launched among county ( city ) departmental cadres and town and village cadres throughout the country is a major move aimed at raising the quality of grass-roots cadres in rural areas , enhancing the rally force and fighting capacity of grass-roots party organizations in rural areas , and promoting social and economic development in rural areas under the new situation .  
They should take supporting the large-scale development of the western region as an important way to increase their fighting capacity and cultivate their militant style of enduring hardships and daring to fight a hard battle and promote army building in an all-round way by providing aid to local people in carrying out urgent , difficult , dangerous , or important tasks .  2 .  
They dished out the so-called strategy of " fighting a decisive battle offshore , " purchased advanced weapons and equipment from abroad without restraint , conducted military exercises directed at the mainland of the motherland in an attempt to increase their capacity of " rejecting reunification through armed force . "  
Under the Dangerous Goods ( General ) Regulations , if a person uses or stores metallic cyanides in excess of 5 kg for general purpose or 10 kg for medical purposes , he has to obtain a dangerous goods licence from the Director of Fire Services , and the substances must be stored in a licensed dangerous goods store that complies with the relevant fire safety requirements issued by FSD . Fire fighting installations and other safety measures which have been approved by the Fire Services Department ( FSD ) must be provided .  
Mr Lai said he was confident that all the staff of the Chek Lap Kok Fire Station were fully aware of the significance of their role and would be dedicated to the provision of top-quality fire fighting and rescue services to visitors and local residents at the new airport to ensure its safe operation , so that the new Hong Kong International Airport would rank with the world 's reputable airports .  
Five groups comprising members of DFCCs across the territory held separate sessions prior to the conference to discuss a wide range of fight crime subjects , which included home and personal safety , drug abuse among youngsters , juvenile crimes relating to triad and vice activities , parents ' responsibilities in fighting youth crime and child abuse .  
He said APEC leaders were determined to reverse the current economic downturn and maintain public confidence at a time of uncertainty by fighting protectionism and pushing for the launch of a new round of World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) talks at the upcoming 4th Ministerial Conference in November .  
On Police commitment in tackling crimes attributable to triad activities , Mr Tsang said a total of 2 472 persons were arrested for a variety of triad related offences .  " At the same time , Police devoted great efforts in fighting cross-border organised crimes .  Hong Kong Police will in March 2002 host an international conference on transnational organised crime which will be attended by prominent members of law enforcement agencies from across the Globe .  
" When the Commissioner took up office in January 2001 , he directed that the Force focus on the maintenance of a strong visible uniform presence on our streets , provide a fast effective response to emergencies , strengthen the Force criminal intelligence system , enlist public assistance in fighting crime as well as further enhancing our liaison with Mainland and overseas law enforcement authorities to combat cross-border crime . "  
Apart from " quick cash crime " , Mr Chau noted that the other major crime category that had registered an increase in the first half of this year was " anti-social crime " such as serious assault , assaulting police , criminal intimidation , arson , resisting arrest , criminal damage , and disorderly / fighting in public place .  
On February 15 , President Chiang Ching-kuo was nominated for re-election as president of the Republic of China . In accepting the unanimous decision of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang , Chiang said he was a " willing soldier ready to go back to the battlefield with a fighting spirit . " Although the choice came as no real surprise , it confirmed the wide support and popularity he has among the entire population .  
A novel and effective system was introduced to correct the boys ' faulty sense of values . Their actions were scaled on a gradient . ' Red light ' actions such as lying , fighting and stealing were strictly prohibited and if committed , firmly punished . ' Yellow light ' actions such as playing , if indulged in without permission , were punished only mildly .  
The limited number of winners and the extreme conditions required to earn this distinctiondiligent adherence to duty and training , coupled with the crucial element of cooperation among the soldiershave served to raise the standard of a fighting spirit , help establish a military " model unit " , and an efficacy of military strength .  
But after 30 years as an ambassador I 've come to one conclusion about international relations : exhortations to another country about shared feelings , morality , and fighting the common enemy , while not completely useless , are certainly limited in effect ; what 's needed is a relationship of shared interests built on a realistic basis .  
A democratic government has been the goal which China has been long searching for in recent years , but after the Chinese Communists ' abrupt rise , the value of this democratic theory which is applicable everywhere has been muddled and its role confused under the fighting among the political parties of China .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
The KMT 's election broadcasts featured replays of old newsreels showing the DPP 's past street demonstrations and laid the charge against them of engaging in riotous politics . The DPP raised the KMT 's financial scandals to criticize them on counts of corruption and senility . The China Social Democratic Party 's 9-minute broadcast on the theme of growing up accused both parties of pointless fighting and asked where the people are who are going to plant seeds when " the robbers have all got their places . "  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
Seeing through " Huang Fei-hong the idol , " Peng Han-ping believes that the reason Bruce Lee was acknowledged as a hero was because he combined Chinese Wing Chun kungfu with Western fighting techniques to create his own " Stop Fist " kungfu , and his films display real martial arts skill ; to this day , they remain very valuable material for martial arts students to study . But Jet Li 's kungfu is just " display kungfu , " flashy and beautiful , but only good for brief entertainment .  
Yinfeng was left with two children less than ten years old . Women in similar situations rushed to remarry in order to meet their daily needs . Fate dictated that not long after the fighting between the Nationalists and Communists stopped , there was an enormous flood , which ruined the just-planted crops .  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
As the harmful effects of drugs came to be understood , drug trafficking changed from being legal to being a criminal offense around the world . There has been a significant trend toward international cooperation in fighting the drug trade . Producer , transshipment , and consumer nations have joined hands to clamp down at every link in the chain . Only in this way can narcotics activities be completely rooted out .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
He detested civil war , but led troops fighting in civil wars for over a decade ; he was eager to fight the Japanese , but failed when he did so ; he opposed communism half his life , but at the crucial juncture saved the communist party ; he was faithful to Chiang Kai-shek for years , yet while in the field rebelled and kidnapped Chiang , and in the end was kept locked up by Chiang for decades .  
The way this mainland wife was accepted by a traditional Taiwanese clan and has become chairperson of the management committee of their ancestral home , can be attributed not only to her seniority , unbending principles and utter selflessness , but also to her matchless warmhearted enthusiasm and indomitable fighting spirit .  
In the early years of the Republic of China , with constant fighting among the warlords , intellectuals wrote martial arts novels to amuse themselves , and magazine stories grew more and more decadent and extravagant , leading Lu Xun to describe them as " monstrous and evil at heart , and filled with descriptions of romance . " These works invited their urban readers to escape the painful realities of their lives .  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
Another factor was that in the wake of Pearl Harbor , there were only limited numbers of fit , potential conscripts left in Japan , and with the expansion of the Japanese lines from the Pacific to Southeast Asia , the tough , hardworking aboriginal youths , with their knack for fighting in forested mountain terrain , naturally became a priority consideration .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
" The biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says Tsao Chi-hung . " As more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . " The riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the East , the sunset in the West , and the dreamy river alongside the park .  
In such times , people naturally honor a wandering knight who kills on behalf of the powerless . Yuan Jiegang , a scholar of the early Republican era , described the waxing and waning of the knight-errant 's image as follows : Knights-errant were common people who had usurped the power to kill . This could not be tolerated by the imperial authorities . At its height , the Han dynasty sought to eliminate the knights-errant , and their fighting spirit was quickly broken .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
Chung Chiao , head of a drama company and also a judge for the poetry competition , analyzes the poems in terms of content : The Filipino poems subtly reveal the fervent culture of a tropical island colonized by the Spanish , a poetry filled with love of life and more socially conscious , because of the Filipino tradition of fighting for their rights ; Indonesian works tend to emphasize the micro details of human relationships , while the Vietnamese and Thai poems contain more advice and aphorisms .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
They range from familiar staples such as acupuncture , moxibustion , Chinese herbal medicine , qigong and shiatsu , to more exotic-sounding varieties such as homeopathy , magnetic healing and energetic medicine . ( Homeopathy is a traditional European treatment method in which the practitioner first diagnoses the patient 's symptoms , then prescribes tiny doses of drugs that in larger quantities would elicit the same symptoms . The drug 's affinity for the disease boosts the body 's own defense mechanisms . This is similar to the Chinese principle of " fighting poison with poison . " )  
In Hero , Zhang Yimou similarly emphasized symbolic , highly visualized fighting sequences . One example is the fight scene at the chess pavilion between Jet Li and Donnie Yen . Here , the fighting is an exhibition of the martial arts aesthetic and of a skill so consummate that the combatants themselves are able to determine the outcome from just a few preliminary passes .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
The odd thing is that precisely because Taiwan 's public health system was so successful in the past-because the " enemy " had been defeated in every battle-people became inattentive to public health . As time went on , frontline public health personnel neglected their training and lost completely their fighting edge .  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
The Taiwan Minpao carried many excerpts from the notebooks that Chiang kept in prison . From them we can see that he not only made friends with gangsters , but was quite interested in the culture and language of their world , and planned to produce a dictionary of gangster lingo after coming out of prison . At the same time , he was deeply pained by the way the gangsters wasted their courage on fighting against their guards , frequently being injured and growing weak and dispirited as a result .  
In 1915 , following the " Tafen Incident , " Aliman and his elder brother took to the hills to resist the Japanese authorities . Pursued by the Japanese police , the two fraternal heroes led fellow Bunun across peaks and precipices southwestward along the upper reaches of the Laonung River , finally reaching Yusui , hidden deep in harsh protective terrain . There they set up their base and carried on fighting against the Japanese police for more than a decade . Members of many different Aboriginal tribes , moved by their example , joined them .  
After the workshop concluded , the members went on to form the Wenshan Neovista Association , launching a series of talks , fighting for funding , planning the renovation effort , getting the opinions of local residents , and construction companies involved in the effort . After three years of hard work , they finally completed the project . Soon after completion the college opened the hall with a series of art and literature activities , using it to pass on the area 's rich art and culture .  
This lowered his morale . Due to these frustrations , there was a time when Wang considered giving up . But then he considered his original vow to help , and also how he himself had had discipline problems in school : fighting , bullying , low grades . The affirmation and care he received then from his church elders guided him out .  
Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .  
The sudden influx of 20,000 people into the city from the fierce fighting suburban areas , have further deteriorated the living condition there , with the prices of daily necessities shooting up to an unbearable level and many stores having been closed down , social welfare department officials said  
The ongoing fighting and bitter hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina pose a serious threat to international peace and security , causing immense and unacceptable human suffering .  
After the provisional Government disintegrated , an interim Government was proclaimed on 8 April 1994 but left the capital on 12 April 1994 as fighting between the armed forces and the Rwandese Patriotic Front ( RPF ) intensified .  
The Holy See approved of the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , which is an expression of the international community 's commitment to fighting violations of human rights , and it expressed its support by making a symbolic contribution to the special fund established by the Secretary-General to finance the activities of the Tribunal .  
Factional fighting which broke out in Kabul , Afghanistan , on 1 January 1994 , continued throughout the year , causing renewed displacement and imposing a heavy burden on rural communities recovering from 15 years of war .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
In my initial reaction to the letter , I expressed my profound regret at the decision by the Croatian Government , as I strongly believe that the United Nations played a decisive role in bringing to a halt the brutal war on Croatian soil three years ago , and that UNPROFOR has since helped prevent a resumption of renewed fighting .  
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
The facilitation of mutually beneficial joint economic projects to improve living conditions in central and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina has helped to lay a foundation of confidence and trust among a population that had previously witnessed some of the most intense fighting in the present conflict .  
In the Mission 's view , the National Police 's key role in fighting impunity calls for sweeping reforms of its institutional bases and of the process used to select and train its officers , in order to correct its structural and professional weaknesses and to supply it with new resources .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
Oman , like the rest of the international community , accepts neither this new escalation of fighting by attacking United Nations peace-keepers nor the status quo prevailing in those safe areas which recently became subject to the policy of ethnic cleansing .  
This increase took place particularly in places close to the scene of intensified fighting and reflected the growing inability of both rural and urban populations to cope with the daily problems caused by the fighting , the collapse of social services and the unstable economic situation .  
The alleged perpetrators include clandestine organizations which , while claiming to be fighting against crime and impunity , have been responsible for threats of this kind , have thwarted investigations of crimes against human rights , caused the resignation of public prosecutors in high-profile cases and intimidated relatives and prospective new victims . 
It is astonishing to note that the Government and people of Lebanon , who are fighting to liberate their territory from prolonged foreign occupation an inherent and inalienable right recognized by international law and enshrined in the United Nations Charter are called upon to give up their right to self-defence and hence submit to aggression , occupation , and non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
We also support the decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism and punishing its perpetrators , as terrorism has become a dangerous international phenomenon that has taken the lives of many innocent people , destroyed the infrastructure of many countries , disrupted tourism and the free movement of innocent people and defamed national liberation and independence movements .  
As a result of the heavy bombardment of the capital by the Taliban on 26 November 1995 , the Secretary-General expressed his concern about the escalation of fighting and called upon all parties to cooperate with the efforts of the United Nations Special Mission , then headed by Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri , aimed at achieving an immediate ceasefire and promoting negotiations among the parties on a transitional mechanism for the transfer of power , to achieve a just and durable settlement acceptable to all Afghans .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation requests the heads of diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations to report objectively about what they have seen to the Governments , nations or organizations that they represent and give them an accurate account of what is taking place in Burundi : recognized crimes against innocent populations , women , children and defenceless patients can not be mistaken for a struggle for democracy or the liberation of an ethnic group , or presented simply as inter-ethnic confrontation or fighting between the army and the rebels .  
The cease-fire broke down on 29 April when an attempted meeting of the Council of State , attended by Chairman Sankawulo together with Councilmen Taylor and Kromah , was cut short after fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and NPFL / ULIMO-K forces near the executive mansion .  NULLThe fighting rapidly escalated overnight into some of the worst fighting witnessed since the start of the civil war in December 1989 .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
Throughout the country , inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government are major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance and thus slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of tragedy in other areas .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
If steps are not taken to curb the fighting , then the current situation in the West Bank , which has turned into a grim confrontation between organized forces , may do immeasurable damage to the already shaky efforts for a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the region .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
A subject of utmost concern to the Special Committee was the Israeli decision to open an archaeological tunnel beneath the Temple Mount , which had been viewed as a grave provocation by Muslims throughout the world and had sparked the worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians since the beginning of the peace process , in which the Israeli army had responded with excessive force and incursions into the self-rule areas under exclusive Palestinian control .  
In the same way , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Rwanda stated ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 7 ) that the genocide of the Tutsis , the massacres of moderate Hutus and the renewed fighting in the civil war which followed were marked by many grave violations of international humanitarian law .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Despite strenuous diplomatic efforts , in particular by the Secretary-General and his special representative , Mr . Nobert Holl , to broker a ceasefire and engage the warring parties in a peace process , the fighting has been raging unabated , with even greater intensity in recent months . 
While the warring parties have shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it is noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans have taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who are not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
In that connection , he cited the numerous initiatives that had been undertaken by the President of Tunisia , Mr . Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and his continuing efforts to promote peace in Africa . Tunisia called upon the parties concerned to halt the fighting and re-establish peace , and invited international and regional organizations to provide assistance to the victims in order to avert a tragedy that would affect the entire African continent . 
The Secretary-General added , however , that while the warring parties had shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it was noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans had taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who were not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
Inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government remained major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance , slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of crisis conditions in others .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
The rural population , especially in and around the areas of the two principal front lines , has experienced numerous and severe hardships as a result of the fighting which were often compounded by inclement weather .  
Direct consequences of this fighting are the continuing massive loss of human life , killing , refugee flows , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive economic destruction .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
They stated that an enabling political and policy framework was required , for example , with regard to political and economic stability , intellectual property rights and an adequate legal framework , and fighting corruption .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
It expressed its grave concern over the situation of anarchy prevailing in the Comorian Island of Anjouan and the humanitarian problems caused by the fighting which broke out between opposing factions within the separatist movement .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
Those remaining are mostly territorial troops engaged in civil duties , such as voluntary public works in agriculture , construction , irrigation , fighting illiteracy , building churches , roads and bridges , helping the social welfare of villagers , etc .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .

The chronic fighting and the resultant political uncertainty has exacerbated the human misery of innocent Afghan people , who have already suffered for too long and are the real victims of this endless war .  
The objectives of the Government in oil refining are : to increase lubrication oil production to meet overall local demand ; to improve the quality of refined products by reducing sulphur contents in gas oil and kerosene and the necessity for lead compounds in gasoline ; to improve safety standards and fire - fighting capabilities ; to improve environmental protection by enhanced treatment to effluent water and gas emissions ; and to increase operating efficiency in general .  
Despite an increasing awareness of the problem , however , many refugees were once again exposed to cross-border attacks , forced recruitment into armed fighting forces and confinement in remote , isolated and perilously located camps .  
The same difficulty resurfaces in the relationship between economic adjustment programmes , on the one hand , and social or environmental goals such as fighting poverty , providing basic education or health , offering a safety net for the unemployed and protecting tropical forests , on the other . 
To help bring this issue to a just and lasting resolution , the Chinese Government offers encouragement and support to the conflicting parties in Afghanistan so that they can put the interests of their nation and country above everything else , disregard their ethnic , religious and political differences , stop fighting among themselves as soon as possible and establish a broad-based and stable government acceptable to all sides , on the basis of mutual respect and extensive consultations .  
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
Through these multifaceted but integrated activities , UNCTAD should contribute to ensuring the overall coherence of the global economic system and to making it more conducive to fighting poverty , reducing inequality within and among nations , protecting the right of present and future generations to the preservation of the environment , integrating women on an equal basis , generating employment and integrating the marginalized fully into the global economy .  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,  
By actively participating in the preparatory process for the special session on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit , my Government would like to contribute to achieving our common goals in fighting poverty , creating productive jobs and making a stable , safe and just society for all .  
While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the difficulties that the concerned Governments face in fighting armed insurgent groups , she notes with concern that in some countries Governments have adopted counter-insurgency strategies , often involving excessive and indiscriminate use of force , aimed at targeting those suspected of being members , collaborators or sympathizers of those groups , leading to further violations of the right to life .  
They also trained the Kamajor paramilitary troops who are fighting the rebel forces of the overthrown Government with the acquiescence of the current Government and are responsible for grave human rights violations against prisoners and the civilian population .

Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
Concluding asset-sharing arrangements as a means of enabling forfeited proceeds of crime to be used to strengthen the capacity of national criminal justice systems and contributing a part of such proceeds to programmes such as those aimed at enhancing national capacities for fighting crime in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , paying due consideration to the rights of bona fide third parties ;  
While the Dayton Agreement stopped the fighting and the most egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , underlying issues were to a large extent left to the parties to resolve among themselves on the basis of the Dayton principles .

To further assist in fighting international organized crime , I am pleased to inform the Council that the official inauguration of the Sarajevo national Interpol office , established with considerable UNMIBH assistance , will take place next week .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
Mines and other sources of natural wealth are remote and heavily guarded , often located in areas subject to outbreaks of fighting or armed attacks against the local population .  
The recent surge in these activities by Pakistan , however , is a mere supplement to its widespread presence in Afghanistan , as Pakistan maintains thousands of military personnel , non-commissioned officers , armed nationals belonging to numerous Pakistan-based extremist organizations and volunteers from religious schools called the Madrassa , fighting alongside the Taliban mercenaries .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .

Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
The situation of military detentions by KFOR is based on rather more obscure legal grounds . 9 The Special Representative is informed that KFOR routinely arrests and detains individuals on an extrajudicial basis , mostly ethnic Albanians suspected of fighting in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia , citing resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and customary international law as the legal sources of KFOR authority for detentions .
