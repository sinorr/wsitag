This is very dangerous .

If we , the United Nations united not , as 50 years ago , against someone , but driven by the desire for peaceful cooperation show sufficient determination to give effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at major conferences such as those held under United Nations auspices in recent years , the world stands a chance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-first century .  
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
Appeals to Governments to empower rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and to actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;

The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
In this regard , it is concerned as to whether sufficient budgetary allocations are made and adequate social measures are being taken to protect children , in particular those living in poverty or belonging to vulnerable groups , from being the victims of this situation , in the light of the provisions of articles 3 and 4 of the Convention .  
Whenever women have joined decision-making bodies in sufficient numbers , they have created a more collaborative atmosphere , characterized by mutual respect , independent of prevailing political differences , and sought consensus .  
It was noted that neither the principle of universal jurisdiction embodied in some national legislation nor the mechanism of international judicial cooperation was sufficient to achieve the said objective and that , while it was incumbent on Governments to bring such individuals to justice , the international community could complement and assist national efforts , in particular in situations where authorities were not in a position to maintain law and order .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;

" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .  
Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;

NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .

While FICSA recognized that its proposal represented a radical change from the current structure of the Commission , it believed that minor changes would not be sufficient , since in its current form the Commission was too unresponsive , too political and too expensive .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .

asks the United Nations Security Council to ensure the full implementation of that agreement by adopting a feasible mandate based on the establishment of an effective provisional administration and the deployment of a credible international force equipped with sufficient resources .  
The Government of Sri Lanka had endeavoured to reduce to the absolute minimum the hardships forced on the peoples concerned , and to that end it had taken steps to ensure that they received food , medicine and other essential items without interruption and in sufficient quantities , although the aforementioned secessionist group was diverting a substantial part of that assistance for its own war effort .  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
These reforms are aimed at achieving the following objectives : first , to improve the Government 's ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of properly trained Malawians to meet professional and specialized manpower needs ; and , secondly , to improve the morale , motivation and work ethic of civil servants through proactive measures , such as the regular review and rationalization of pay and benefits schemes .  
But if this argument is not considered sufficient to prove that the world remains as unjust , unequal and dangerous as it was some years ago , it suffices to look at the conflicts which , with their profound causes that no one can resolve and their tragic consequences that can not be prevented or avoided , fill the newspapers every day .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Sustainability of human settlements entails their balanced geographical distribution or other appropriate distribution in keeping with national conditions , the maintenance of biodiversity and cultural diversity , promotion of economic and social development , and human health and education , as well as air , water , vegetation and soil qualities at standards sufficient to sustain human life and well-being for all time .

It is apparent from the comparative data provided that over time , changes in the number , scope , scale and complexity of peace-keeping operations , as well as the considerations outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 above , have affected and rendered less meaningful the pragmatic validity of the current methodology and funding formula for the support account and its ability to generate a sufficient , assured and stable level of resources , which is necessary to support essential backstopping functions at Headquarters .  
This force , at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment , and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH , was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned , and no more . 
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
Experience gained in those missions indicates that , given the complexity of the logistical , contractual and financial issues involved , sufficient time and staff resources should be provided for the in situ completion of all such administrative liquidation tasks , as this reduces the number of unresolved residual matters that have to be dealt with at Headquarters after the liquidation team has been disbanded .  
A state of war ( in 49 countries ) , a threat of war ( in 46 countries ) , a threat to national security ( in 52 countries ) , internal political instability ( in 52 countries ) and other public emergency ( in 49 countries ) is not sufficient justification for torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .

Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
However , the Working Group considered that the existing coordinating structures , at least at the international level , were sufficient to ensure the treatment of the atmosphere protection issues in an integrated manner , and the establishment of new intergovernmental bodies could not therefore be justified .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
It would be an illusion to think that this innovative model of peace-keeping will be able to succeed in Liberia , especially under current conditions , unless sufficient and reliable sources of funding are provided to ECOMOG , and unless the force is strengthened and structured in a manner that will enable it to carry out its tasks as a professional peace-keeping force .  
Although most of the countries in Latin America continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , which is so essential for creating an atmosphere conducive to strengthening regional cooperation , in many areas their growth was not sufficient to reduce the " social deficits " accumulated in earlier years .

Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .

Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .

When an exceptionally cold winter in the northern hemisphere raised demand , inventories were allowed to fall as the industry expected that Iraq would resume exporting oil under Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , in which the Council authorized States to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of US $ 1-billion every 90 days .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
Factors contributing to this deficiency include lack of political will , unavailability of sufficient financial means , lack of full understanding of the exact obligations of the instrument , and the compressed time schedule of many negotiations , which may leave room for multiple interpretations of the agreed text , and this may give rise to potential disputes .

In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Not many reports have furnished sufficient information concerning such relevant matters as the minimum age at which a juvenile may be charged with a criminal offence , the maximum age at which a person is still considered to be a juvenile , the existence of special courts and procedures , the laws governing procedures against juveniles and how all these special arrangements for juveniles take account of " the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation " .  
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
Moreover , the concept of food security must stress such components as the production of a sufficient amount of food , a stable supply throughout the year , access to food for all , a proper and equitable distribution , and a commitment to producing the components of a balanced and healthy diet in keeping with local nutritional practices .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
The endemic housing shortage , declining standard of living and lack of sufficient Palestinian educational institutions within the City limits delineated by Israel have forced numerous parents to send their children to schools that are officially outside Jerusalem and may be less expensive than the ones located in the City .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
There are effective family planning programmes , with universal coverage and no account taken of marital status or whether the relationship is stable , although they could be better if we have available enough different types of contraceptive for each case , and in sufficient quantities ; supply is a problem under current economic circumstances . 
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance , which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed , inter alia , to increase export earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
However , even with sufficient resources , the initiative 's main goal of reaching external debt sustainability would be unattainable unless a favourable international economic climate were created to provide open access to markets , modern technologies and sources of development financing .  
Competitiveness , the need for technological upgrading , a focus on style , quality , design and timely delivery : none of these elements found their way into traditional adjustment programmes , where it was automatically assumed that comparative cost , in the form of cheap labour , would be sufficient .  
While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Similarly , any person entering the country had to declare cash in excess of $ 10,000 , and any lawyer or legal firm acting as the resident agent of a Panamanian company must know the client and keep sufficient information to identify him or it to the relevant authorities when required . 
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
If the General Assembly decided to implement the composite post adjustment for Geneva , the organizations concerned should be requested to make the necessary changes in their respective staff rules , and should be given sufficient time to do so ; otherwise , further inequities could result , which would be tantamount to a break-up of the common system .  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .  
The financial situation of the Agency was becoming more disturbing with every year that passed , and in that connection the European Union called on the international community to provide maximum political and financial support to the Agency and to give it sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its tasks until a just , lasting and comprehensive solution had been found to the political problems which had led to the appearance of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East . 
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
The constant state of financial difficulties , a very lengthy period of transition and the crippling effect of serious time constraints on all participants in the legislative process has led to a situation where budgetary approval comes about not as the result of an orderly process but rather as an achievement arrived at in an ad hoc manner often in the absence of sufficient data , analysis and justification .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
Some were of the opinion that there has not yet been sufficient support in space law to conclude that a right of passage for ascending or descending space objects has been recognized as a rule of customary international law , but that in practice , such passage occurred without protest , and that as long as the passage was innocent and not prejudicial to the peace and security of subjacent States , then it could serve as the basis for the legalization of the actual practice .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
It was stressed that the very high real interest rates in transitional economies such as Kazakstan were characteristic of a transitional period of macro adjustment and reflected high levels of uncertainty and perceived risks to lenders ; such rates did not represent equilibrium conditions and far exceeded the possibilities for most enterprises to generate sufficient real income . 
In order for the UNISPACE III Conference to yield concrete results in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , sufficient consideration should be given to the planning of realistic and feasible follow-up activities that could be implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the UNISPACE III Conference .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
However , this criterion must be linked with the preceding one , since such control must be sufficient to enable the armed group or dissident forces to conduct sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the Protocol .  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Despite the tighter labour markets and strong consumer demand in the United States and the United Kingdom , inflation rates in both countries remain subdued , and there were only sporadic signs of incipient inflationary pressures , although in late March 1997 the Federal Reserve considered that these were sufficient to justify a small increase in the federal funds rate . 
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
Yet the attainment of a proper mix of distributive and redistributive policies is important , because private initiative , although crucial , is not sufficient for the achievement of an equitable and prosperous society .  
The assembled leaders renewed their commitment to ensure that all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life .  
At a more basic level , the question was raised as to whether the categories of acts listed in chapter III of the outline possessed sufficient elements in common to be treated alike or to be subjected to the same legal regime .  
The independent expert considered that the advisory services programme had not provided sufficient support for surveys required prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or for the preparation of reports by States in need of assistance .  
The experiences of small island developing States to date suggest that institutional and administrative capacity-building is a protracted and complex process that requires sustained political commitment and sufficient resources .  
While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
The transformation from emergency reconstruction to sustainable longer-term development also assumes continued political and economic stability , which provides a necessary , but not sufficient , basis for rapid growth , a key national objective .  
Consequently , the appellate court found that the affidavits of the subjective intent of both parties raised sufficient factual question as to the terms of the parties contract under article 8 ( 1 ) CISG that summary judgment was inappropriate .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
The overall objective is to provide analysts and decision makers at the national and international level with a sufficient number of relevant , timely and reliable development indicators .  
Such information may relate to the size and type of previous projects carried out by the bidders ; the level of experience of the key personnel to be engaged in the project ; sufficient organizational capability , including minimum levels of construction , operation and maintenance equipment .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
Even if the case results in the summary dismissal of a staff member , the evidence may not be sufficient to satisfy the standard of proof applicable in criminal matters considered by national courts .  
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , including through international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Notes that the United Nations Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of Human Rights does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but are facing economic hardship ;  
It should also be emphasized that another of its objectives was to forestall the financial crisis facing the existing social security institutions in the medium term , and thereby ensure that their income would be sufficient to meet their obligations to pensioners and their administrative costs .  
The Chairman-Rapporteur noted that no governmental delegation had expressed formal opposition to the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples within the United Nations system , although a number of Governments had stated that they had not yet taken a final position with regard to whether a new forum should be established , or whether it would be sufficient to broaden the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations .  
The alternative approach that was suggested ( i.e . , the inclusion of an open-ended provision describing such financial practices in sufficiently broad terms to cover existing practices and future developments ) was found to be impractical in view of the difficulty of describing a wide range of heterogeneous and rapidly changing practices with sufficient precision .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
In other words , a Government or a State should possess on a permanent basis , a legal system and material resources sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of [ its ] international obligations under normal conditions . 30 In particular , the State must have established , and maintain , an administrative apparatus that is minimally sufficient to permit it to fulfil those obligations ; 
It indicated that in current circumstances Iraq would be unable to export oil and petroleum products in sufficient quantities to realize the total sum established for phase IV under resolution 1154 ( 1998 ) because of the limited productive capacity of the oil sector and the sharp fall there had been in oil prices in world markets . 
The study determined that there would be no great technical difficulties in constructing an airstrip sufficient for light aircraft to make the 1,000 kilometre round trip from French Polynesia to Pitcairn . 4 A traveller to the island who posted a report of his visit on the Internet wrote that a town meeting had been held to discuss the project and support for it among residents was evident . 
Where the total net remuneration before promotion of a staff member in the General Service and related categories exceeds that at the Professional level before promotion , established in accordance with subparagraph ( d ) above , a personal transitional allowance in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of subparagraph ( a ) will be paid until such time as it is overtaken by increases in net remuneration at the Professional level .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
In connection with regulation 2 , some delegations were of the view that the biennial financial period should not start in 2002 , since budgetary requirements to be estimated in advance of a biennial period could only be based on stable and foreseeable expenditure patterns and the Meeting did not yet have sufficient information to foresee the developments in relation to the Tribunal 's expenditures .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
At its forty _ ninth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1997 / 107 taking note that it did not have sufficient time for a comprehensive discussion of the final report of the Special Rapporteur on income distribution and human rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 9 ) , decided to postpone to its fiftieth session the presentation by Mr . Bengoa of his final report and to request him to complete his report by preparing a supplementary document on this issue .  
During the two phases , it is very important to obtain sufficient information from the potential mining sites ( commonly termed " baseline data " ) to document clearly the natural conditions which exist prior to mining , and to gain insights into the natural processes such as dispersion and settling of particles , and benthic faunal succession , and to gather other data which will make it possible to acquire the necessary predictive capability for accurate environmental impact prediction .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .

Mobilizing and providing sufficient resources to meet the growing demand for access to information , counselling , services and follow-up on the widest possible range of safe , effective , affordable and acceptable family planning and contraceptive methods , including new options and underutilized methods ;  
It is recognized that there is a vital link between national stability and economic and social development , and that the provision of adequate and sufficient assistance to Haiti is largely subject to a return to political stability .  
The general principles are that : ( a ) in order to be both financially viable and of sufficient quality for simultaneous interpretation , communications for remote interpretation require the use of ISDN lines for the transmission of both audio and video ; and ( b ) under the International Standards Organization standards applicable to simultaneous interpretation equipment , the minimum sound bandwidth acceptable for interpretation purposes is 12.5 kHz .  
Given the lack of educated and trained manpower , international efforts are required to ensure that sufficient opportunities are available to developing countries to build their human resource base in different areas of space technology and its applications ;

Information and education efforts should be intensified , especially in the context of bilateral or multilateral technical cooperation programmes , with a view to ensuring respect for and proper implementation of certain existing laws which provide sufficient procedural guarantees . 
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
Stressing also the need for a supportive international economic environment that is conducive to improving the developing countries terms of trade , market access and access to technology , as well as to fostering better commodity prices , stable exchange rates and international interest rates and to enabling the provision of sufficient resources for development ,  
Scenario 1 projected an end-of-year payment of $ 197-million by the United States , while scenario 2 assumed that the United States would pay sufficient regular budget and peacekeeping assessments , in addition to funds which it had previously appropriated but not yet paid , to reduce its total obligations to the equivalent of the most recent two-year assessments , or approximately $ 350-million .  
The Committees attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that are to be financed outside of the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received , in advance , from the States Parties and States not parties participating in such activities .  
The worsening of the debt situation of middle-income and some lower-middle-income countries was due not only to the incapacity to pay debt obligations owing to temporary shortfalls in revenues but also to the more structural problem of raising sufficient revenue , particularly hard currency , in the long term to service their debts , while preserving their sustained economic growth and development .  
However , in order to protect workers from employers who might attempt to impose harsh wage conditions or who might fail to pay workers a wage sufficient to meet their basic needs , the State has felt obliged to intervene in order to improve the living standards of workers and , consequently , contractual freedom is no longer absolute in the field of employment since the State has begun to intervene in order to protect workers , particularly in regard to wages .  
Due regard must also be paid to the need for consistency in classification , nomenclature , terminology and definitions and the committee 's minimum wage proposals must be based on those to which an average skilled and competent worker is entitled , without gender-based discrimination , in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and the need to ensure that the wage is sufficient to meet the worker 's basic needs .  
Calls upon all countries to ensure the provision of sufficient financial resources , on a stable and predictable basis , for the successful implementation of the work programme for the biennium 2000-2001 , and reiterates the recognition by the Commission on Human Settlements at its seventeenth session that this implementation will require substantial additional funding and its request to the Executive Director to raise more funds from all sources and to broaden the donor base ;

Measures to prevent the corruption , by organized criminal groups , of public officials and persons who provide public services , such as feasible measures to detect and monitor the transborder movement of cash , subject to safeguards to ensure proper use of information , and to establish sufficient internal accounting controls to enable their personnel to detect acts of corruption ;  
Stressing also the need for a supportive international economic environment that is conducive to improving the developing countries terms of trade , market access and access to technology , as well as to fostering better commodity prices , stable exchange rates and international interest rates and to enabling the provision of sufficient resources for development ,  
In this respect , Tunisia calls for international solidarity so as to put an end to the existing disparities between the rich and poor countries , between those with sufficient resources to provide their citizens with a happy old age and enough to live on , and those whose meagre resources are insufficient to meet adequately the many needs of their people , especially the elderly .  
For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
Motivated by the need to protect the health and safety or our population and our environment , we believe that these efforts should continue , thus promoting the adoption of mechanisms that will provide sufficient guarantees to all the States concerned that the strictest safety measures will be applied in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , and that any damage resulting from accidents in connection with such operations will be made good .  
The Committee ' s attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties which , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the State parties in advance .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations . 
Unfortunately , we all know that the commitments undertaken in the Convention were not sufficient to meet its ultimate objective , which is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system .  
Invites all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction and coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as the El Nio phenomenon .  
The Commission invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities .  
The Committee notes that since 1994 , in addressing the budget deficits by slashing social expenditure , the State party has not paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the Canadian population as a whole , and by vulnerable groups in particular .  
For small loads typical of rural households in remote areas with sufficient insolation , solar PV systems are proving to be economically and technically successful , when complemented by an institutional approach , including financial arrangements , that provides for the installation of the systems and maintenance on a fee-for-service basis .  
In other areas the Conference had not had sufficient time to elaborate more satisfactory solutions , but he had voted in favour of the Statute because it marked a historic step closer to the ideal of a more just and free international society .  
This is especially true where products ( especially services ) are difficult to specify clearly and may vary significantly in quality ( for which sufficient adjustment is not made ) , and where annual national average prices are able to fall , quite logically , within a wide price band ( as say , in the case of India or China ) .  
With regard to the above , there have not been sufficient efforts or effective measures by the Government to replace the authoritarian components of its system of organization with the elementary principles characteristic of any pluralist and democratic society , this being most apparent at the middle levels of the State and particularly in local administrations .  
From what the Special Rapporteur was able to determine , it may be said that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has been complying with these agreements , although there has been a pronounced delay in their implementation , a matter which , as already stated , is most disturbing inasmuch as the measures agreed are of the greatest importance for achieving a climate of dtente with sufficient safeguards before the legislative elections due to be held on a date not yet fixed in 1999 .  
Since , in Chile , credit approval depends on the applicants solvency and ability to offer sufficient collateral , with real property being preferred to personal property , married women under the joint ownership regime face legal obstacles .

" In the coming rainy seasons , the Observatory will give , to the extent possible , some advance indication of the issuance of warnings and signals so that people will have sufficient time to take precautions against severe weather .  " We have maintained the thrust on development works aimed at improving the forecasting of heavy rains in the coming rainy season , " he said .  
Given the advanced development of forensic analysis , it is now possible to take a buccal swab ( being a non-intimate sample ) to obtain a buccal cell sample by wiping a swab along the inside of the cheek part of the mouth of a person which is sufficient for analysing the DNA profile of that person .  This method is quick , efficient and the degree of interference is low .  
( i ) Firstly , to appoint the coming New Year 's eve as an additional general holiday is a proactive precautionary measure whereby banks will not have to provide services for customers and will have sufficient time to complete all essential back-up operations ( including data back-up of customers ' records ) in an orderly manner . 
" The Board recognised that under the current reclamation scheme the provision of commercial land which has been reduced to a total of 8.77 hectares in the Area may affect the future supply of highest quality Grade A offices .  " It is therefore necessary to closely monitor the provision of commercial land in the long run so as to ensure that there would be sufficient supply of highest quality Grade A offices to sustain Hong Kong 's position as a world class city .  
" In carrying out the various EPP measures , the Treasury will ensure there are sufficient measures to maintain the quality of service , " Mr Shum said .

Having obtained legal advice , Labour Department considered that there was no sufficient evidence to prove that the employment agencies in 3 of the complaints have overcharged commission and abetted employers to underpay wages .  In this connection , no disciplinary action was taken against the employment agencies concerned .  Separately , the employment agencies involved in the other 2 complaints were prosecuted for charging FDHs services charges higher than the statutory level .  They were eventually convicted and were fined $ 5,000 and $ 30,000 respectively .  
" Women have special needs in areas such as physical and mental health , and they face different barriers and difficulties .  These include sexual violence and domestic violence problems , lack of formal education opportunities while they were young , unemployment at middle age , the digital divide , immense pressures faced by working women with dual roles , single parent families lacking sufficient support , as well as difficulties faced by disabled women .  All these lead us to feel that there is a need to empower women , " Ms Kao continued .  
Students with moderate to profound hearing impairment and having acquired sufficient language skills are integrated in ordinary classes .  Inspectors of ED visit schools regularly to advise teachers and social workers on how best to support these students .  
Question : It was reported that the Secretary for Housing had indicated that the Government had planned and reserved a sufficient number of produced and formed sites to meet the additional housing demand arising from the population growth in the coming eight years .  
The traditional reluctance to inflict indiscriminate brutality is gone : in its place is a terrifying , lethal , religiously motivated determination ' to create massive , history-changing bloodshed ' , preferably of sufficient magnitude to destabilise , if not topple , the hated , infidel Western world .

With an area of 64.26 square kilometers , Penghu has an average rainfall of only 1,000 mm . a year , which is not sufficient . To make matters worse , the islands are mostly flat ( highest elevation , Mount Mao is only 73 meters above sea level ) , and the dark igneous basalt rock is porous .  
She believes that MSG 's principal ingredient , glutamic acid , is not irreplaceable . " The human body can automatically produce this compound or naturally absorb it from fruits and vegetables . That is sufficient , " she says . It is more intelligent to keep MSG , like table salt , at arm 's length . "  
Loopholes in the law " The Voice of Taiwan " violated criminal laws , was investigated by the prosecutor 's office which found sufficient evidence to act , and then was closed down for its unlawful behavior . Meanwhile , the " Green Peace Taiwan Cultural Broadcasting Station " and " Taiwan News Transfer " have not been set up in accord with legal procedures . They should have applied to set up , and by not doing so they have violated their responsibilities under the Broadcasting Law . These are two different situations .  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet . No text book explains to children that raising dogs requires a number of conditions , including sufficient space and a responsible commitment to the dog .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
Their owners are not only required to provide them with sufficient food and drinking water and a safe living environment with adequate shelter , air and light , but must also prevent them suffering unnecessary disturbance , abuse or injury . Animals must not be subjected to fear or pain when being transported , and they may only be slaughtered by humane methods which cause the least possible suffering .  
A new 42-move form was established for the Asian Games , with contestants being judged on their facility in the form , including points such as whether a leg is raised high enough or if movements performed from a low squat are executed with sufficient power . The competitive element has attracted many young people to taijiquan , but has also provoked controversy within martial arts circles .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
Western imperialism left a legacy of imbalance in the use of the world 's resources . Poorer nations , pressed by rapid population growth and the desire to develop , and lacking sufficient management or technical skills , usually rejected calls from the wealthy countries to put the environment first .  
In the Ming dynasty , qigong was incorporated into the study of martial arts and the cultivation of " internal " strength became a prerequisite to the study of the jian . With sufficient internal strength , anyone could be a Zhang Wuji . Gradual realization becomes sudden realization . Going further , what was tangible becomes intangible .  
Homeschoolers , meanwhile , take issue with outsiders ' criticisms that the sheltered environment of homeschooling might leave children deficient in skills of social adaptability . " Of course children should be protected when they are most impressionable , " says Kao Wei-chien . In his view , if you wait until children have developed sufficient powers of resistance before letting them out in the world , then they will have a positive impact on society , rather than be led astray by it .  
The war not only left Vietnam with countless deformed children , but also greatly hindered its economic development . Today its national income per capita is only US $ 600 , less than one-tenth of that in Taiwan , and the state is unable to provide sufficient medical resources and personnel to treat so many patients .  
During the early stages of the epidemic in Hong Kong , it was said that " three health professionals go down for every patient cured . " But now there are virtually zero transmissions among caregivers in that city . In contrast , Taiwan still lacks enough protective suits , masks , and portable oxygen tanks , with the result being that many health care workers are resigning to protect themselves . It appears that Taiwan has not given sufficient attention to training its medical professionals for epidemics , or to protecting them in the event .  
The unencumbered balance of appropriations , $ 34,655,950 gross ( $ 35,247,050 net ) as at 31 December 1993 , will be sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining MINURSO at its current military and civilian strength for a period of some 10 months .  
Based on these logistical factors , the existing UNOSOM aircraft fleet is not sufficient to meet current military and humanitarian requirements within Somalia .  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
If we , the United Nations united not , as 50 years ago , against someone , but driven by the desire for peaceful cooperation show sufficient determination to give effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at major conferences such as those held under United Nations auspices in recent years , the world stands a chance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-first century .  
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
Appeals to Governments to empower rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and to actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
Owing to the acute economic crisis , the State was unable to guarantee to a sufficient extent the protection of such inalienable rights as the right to work , the right to an adequate living standard and the right to housing or to protect the rights of many refugees and illegal immigrants in the country .  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
In this regard , it is concerned as to whether sufficient budgetary allocations are made and adequate social measures are being taken to protect children , in particular those living in poverty or belonging to vulnerable groups , from being the victims of this situation , in the light of the provisions of articles 3 and 4 of the Convention .  
Whenever women have joined decision-making bodies in sufficient numbers , they have created a more collaborative atmosphere , characterized by mutual respect , independent of prevailing political differences , and sought consensus .  
It was noted that neither the principle of universal jurisdiction embodied in some national legislation nor the mechanism of international judicial cooperation was sufficient to achieve the said objective and that , while it was incumbent on Governments to bring such individuals to justice , the international community could complement and assist national efforts , in particular in situations where authorities were not in a position to maintain law and order .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression , although the Security Council may , in conformity with the Charter , conclude that a determination that an act of aggression has been committed would not be justified in the light of other relevant circumstances , including the fact that the acts concerned or their consequences are not of sufficient gravity .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Strongly appeals to all women , in particular rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;

The overexpenditure under this heading was a result of higher requirements for standard troop cost reimbursement ( $ 171,000 ) due to the delayed departure of the Finnish contingent in December 1993 , to additional ration costs ( $ 78,000 ) to replenish UNDOF 's provisions inventory to a level sufficient to sustain operations while newly sought commercial ration contracts were being established , and to slightly higher than anticipated travel costs ( $ 8,000 ) .  
Authorizes States , notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 ( a ) , 3 ( b ) and 4 of resolution 661 ( 1990 ) and subsequent relevant resolutions , to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , including financial and other essential transactions directly relating thereto , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of one-billion United States dollars every 90 days for the purposes set out in this resolution and subject to the following conditions :

A second programme : " Applications of biotechnology for development " is presently a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life . 
In Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the problems were identified as inadequate management of fisheries , over-utilization of some stocks , unregulated fishing , overcapitalization , excessive fleet size , vessel reflagging to escape controls , insufficient selection of gear , unreliable databases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States .  
It would be sufficient to state , with reference to all the topics included in the draft , that the tribunal should determine in each case whether at a given stage in the arbitral proceedings for which the preparatory conference was being held it was inappropriate or impractical to consider a specific topic .  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
" With such political , economic and social developments , the Republic of China on Taiwan has a strong desire , and sufficient capability , to reciprocate for what it has received from the international community , and to fulfil its international responsibilities in order to contribute to global peace and prosperity .  
" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .  
Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;

NULLWhile it is true that a high rate of investment is not by itself sufficient to bring about sustained development , no developing country has achieved sustainable , vigorous economic development with low rates of investment .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change .  
The reform seeks to introduce a professionalized and efficient first-level appeal system to replace the current volunteer system which , in an era of increasing management accountability for programme delivery coupled with declining resources and an increasing number of cases , makes it difficult to attract sufficient experienced and qualified staff to discharge these vital functions .  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
While FICSA recognized that its proposal represented a radical change from the current structure of the Commission , it believed that minor changes would not be sufficient , since in its current form the Commission was too unresponsive , too political and too expensive .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .

The Government of Sri Lanka had endeavoured to reduce to the absolute minimum the hardships forced on the peoples concerned , and to that end it had taken steps to ensure that they received food , medicine and other essential items without interruption and in sufficient quantities , although the aforementioned secessionist group was diverting a substantial part of that assistance for its own war effort .  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
These reforms are aimed at achieving the following objectives : first , to improve the Government 's ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of properly trained Malawians to meet professional and specialized manpower needs ; and , secondly , to improve the morale , motivation and work ethic of civil servants through proactive measures , such as the regular review and rationalization of pay and benefits schemes .  
But if this argument is not considered sufficient to prove that the world remains as unjust , unequal and dangerous as it was some years ago , it suffices to look at the conflicts which , with their profound causes that no one can resolve and their tragic consequences that can not be prevented or avoided , fill the newspapers every day .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
Sustainability of human settlements entails their balanced geographical distribution or other appropriate distribution in keeping with national conditions , the maintenance of biodiversity and cultural diversity , promotion of economic and social development , and human health and education , as well as air , water , vegetation and soil qualities at standards sufficient to sustain human life and well-being for all time .

It is apparent from the comparative data provided that over time , changes in the number , scope , scale and complexity of peace-keeping operations , as well as the considerations outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 above , have affected and rendered less meaningful the pragmatic validity of the current methodology and funding formula for the support account and its ability to generate a sufficient , assured and stable level of resources , which is necessary to support essential backstopping functions at Headquarters .  
This force , at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment , and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH , was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned , and no more . 
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
Experience gained in those missions indicates that , given the complexity of the logistical , contractual and financial issues involved , sufficient time and staff resources should be provided for the in situ completion of all such administrative liquidation tasks , as this reduces the number of unresolved residual matters that have to be dealt with at Headquarters after the liquidation team has been disbanded .  
A state of war ( in 49 countries ) , a threat of war ( in 46 countries ) , a threat to national security ( in 52 countries ) , internal political instability ( in 52 countries ) and other public emergency ( in 49 countries ) is not sufficient justification for torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .

54 In more than two thirds of the responding countries , law enforcement officials were always obliged , before using firearms against persons , to wait between the warning and the direct use of firearms against persons to give the offender sufficient time to observe the warning ; about a quarter reported that this principle was applied usually ; United Kingdom law enforcement officers , depending on their discretion in individual cases , had to wait between warning and the use of firearms only in exceptional cases or never . 
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
However , the Working Group considered that the existing coordinating structures , at least at the international level , were sufficient to ensure the treatment of the atmosphere protection issues in an integrated manner , and the establishment of new intergovernmental bodies could not therefore be justified .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
It would be an illusion to think that this innovative model of peace-keeping will be able to succeed in Liberia , especially under current conditions , unless sufficient and reliable sources of funding are provided to ECOMOG , and unless the force is strengthened and structured in a manner that will enable it to carry out its tasks as a professional peace-keeping force .  
Although most of the countries in Latin America continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , which is so essential for creating an atmosphere conducive to strengthening regional cooperation , in many areas their growth was not sufficient to reduce the " social deficits " accumulated in earlier years . 
Noting that the Argentine Republic had always provided the necessary guarantees and safeguards in order to resolve the sovereign dispute , he expressed his conviction that there were sufficient bases for the establishment of a harmonious , lasting and beneficial relationship among all interested parties , both on the human and economic levels .  
UNDP has defined the conditions for success to include : people having the necessary knowledge , ability , skills and tools ; effective communication processes ; sufficient , relevant , timely and accurate information ; coordinated decision-making ; and control elements designed as integral parts of all activities and systems .

Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
When engaged in a scientific activity abroad a researcher is subject to the " official mission " schedule , which accords him a privileged status and allowances which are dependent on his grade but , in any event , sufficient to cover the costs of his stay abroad and , if necessary , of registration fees and travel .  
The Council decided that , prior to the annual high-level policy dialogue , and allowing sufficient time for preparation , the Secretariat should communicate to the financial and trade institutions a report on the relevant issues to be discussed at the session , with a primary focus on the agreed theme ; and that communication should be prepared in part based on the submission of issues and questions that Member States could be invited to suggest to the Secretariat , which would then be taken into account in the preparation of the Secretariat 's report to the institutions .

The Advisory Committee notes that , as stated in paragraphs 7 and 13 of the report , roving finance officers can be drawn for temporary assignment from existing resources either at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations or the Department of Administration and Management so far as there are sufficient staff resources in their respective departments , services or units to allow them to leave temporarily the functions they carry out without detriment to the quality and delivery of those functions .  
What is particularly lacking in terms of raising domestic competition and increasing the competitiveness of economies in transition is a sufficient number of privately owned medium-sized enterprises capable of growing and competing not only in domestic markets but also in foreign markets .  
Thus , the main lesson learned to date indicates that , while promoting new small enterprises may have helped to create a thriving SME sector , it has not so far created a sufficient mass of vigorous and innovative medium-sized enterprises capable of becoming a driving force for a healthy market economy .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
The Executive Director shall prepare a biennial budget , based on the approved outline of the Fund , sufficient to cover all anticipated core and programme support activities in a form consistent with relevant United Nations budgetary regulations , rules , policies and practices .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but that face economic hardship ;  
Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  We believe , however , that it is crucial for the international community to provide these new institutions with sufficient resources to enable them to discharge their important functions .  
The expert members of the Preparatory Committee , who represented a variety of national legal systems , were eminently qualified to prepare a comprehensive and widely acceptable proposal , provided that sufficient time was set aside for that purpose .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
The concept of health security encompasses all aspects of the basic rights to health : the right to freedom of choice and personal security ; the right to food in sufficient quantity and quality ; the right to live and work in environments where known health risks are controlled ; and the right to have access to education , information and decent housing .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
At its 10th plenary meeting , on 4 April 1997 , however , the Council decided , in order to allow the secretariat sufficient time to complete the tasks assigned to it by the Council at its nineteenth session , that the dates of the special session should not be fixed as yet but that it should be held over a three-day period between late 1997 and the end of January 1998 .  
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
With sufficient political will and the coordinated implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , as well as international cooperation in creating an enabling environment , full employment remains an attainable goal .

When an exceptionally cold winter in the northern hemisphere raised demand , inventories were allowed to fall as the industry expected that Iraq would resume exporting oil under Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , in which the Council authorized States to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of US $ 1-billion every 90 days .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
Factors contributing to this deficiency include lack of political will , unavailability of sufficient financial means , lack of full understanding of the exact obligations of the instrument , and the compressed time schedule of many negotiations , which may leave room for multiple interpretations of the agreed text , and this may give rise to potential disputes .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
At the Workshop , which was held in the form of a free discussion , the participants agreed on the urgent need to protect those who were exposed to extreme suffering resulting from a lack of sufficient protection .

The Special Rapporteur thus deeply regrets the fact that the States which had formed the nucleus of this multinational force were forced to break off their concerted efforts , after spending weeks setting up a base at Entebbe ( Uganda ) , owing to the lack of sufficient political support from the international community and to Rwanda 's repeated opposition to the undertaking .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;

Having completed its preliminary consideration of the legal issues and possible provisions to be considered in uniform rules on digital signatures , as reflected in part II of the present report , the Working Group noted that , for lack of sufficient time , it could not enter into any detailed discussion of the issues of incorporation by reference at the current session . 
The Director , DAMR , is concerned that the authorized level of resources are not sufficient to meet his current audit and oversight responsibilities within acceptable professional standards of an average cycle of once every five to seven years .  
First of all , in the view of ACC members , the report does not take sufficient account of the broad variety of NGOs , whose roles , operational procedures and financial requirements are quite different , ranging from large international organizations to national support NGOs and representative peoples ' organizations .  
In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Not many reports have furnished sufficient information concerning such relevant matters as the minimum age at which a juvenile may be charged with a criminal offence , the maximum age at which a person is still considered to be a juvenile , the existence of special courts and procedures , the laws governing procedures against juveniles and how all these special arrangements for juveniles take account of " the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation " .  
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
Moreover , the concept of food security must stress such components as the production of a sufficient amount of food , a stable supply throughout the year , access to food for all , a proper and equitable distribution , and a commitment to producing the components of a balanced and healthy diet in keeping with local nutritional practices .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
The endemic housing shortage , declining standard of living and lack of sufficient Palestinian educational institutions within the City limits delineated by Israel have forced numerous parents to send their children to schools that are officially outside Jerusalem and may be less expensive than the ones located in the City .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
There are effective family planning programmes , with universal coverage and no account taken of marital status or whether the relationship is stable , although they could be better if we have available enough different types of contraceptive for each case , and in sufficient quantities ; supply is a problem under current economic circumstances . 
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance , which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed , inter alia , to increase export earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
However , even with sufficient resources , the initiative 's main goal of reaching external debt sustainability would be unattainable unless a favourable international economic climate were created to provide open access to markets , modern technologies and sources of development financing .  
Competitiveness , the need for technological upgrading , a focus on style , quality , design and timely delivery : none of these elements found their way into traditional adjustment programmes , where it was automatically assumed that comparative cost , in the form of cheap labour , would be sufficient .  
While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Similarly , any person entering the country had to declare cash in excess of $ 10,000 , and any lawyer or legal firm acting as the resident agent of a Panamanian company must know the client and keep sufficient information to identify him or it to the relevant authorities when required . 
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
If the General Assembly decided to implement the composite post adjustment for Geneva , the organizations concerned should be requested to make the necessary changes in their respective staff rules , and should be given sufficient time to do so ; otherwise , further inequities could result , which would be tantamount to a break-up of the common system .  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .  
The financial situation of the Agency was becoming more disturbing with every year that passed , and in that connection the European Union called on the international community to provide maximum political and financial support to the Agency and to give it sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its tasks until a just , lasting and comprehensive solution had been found to the political problems which had led to the appearance of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East . 
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
We , the United Nations Member States and observer States , have agreed to adopt the Agenda for Development , thus holding forth a global promissory note and universal hope for the millions of our people throughout the entire world who daily go without sufficient food and water , who battle diseases and natural disasters , who can not read or write , who lack shelter , who are jobless , whose entire lives are stunted and who are deprived of the simple pleasures of human existence because of poverty . 
The constant state of financial difficulties , a very lengthy period of transition and the crippling effect of serious time constraints on all participants in the legislative process has led to a situation where budgetary approval comes about not as the result of an orderly process but rather as an achievement arrived at in an ad hoc manner often in the absence of sufficient data , analysis and justification .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
Some were of the opinion that there has not yet been sufficient support in space law to conclude that a right of passage for ascending or descending space objects has been recognized as a rule of customary international law , but that in practice , such passage occurred without protest , and that as long as the passage was innocent and not prejudicial to the peace and security of subjacent States , then it could serve as the basis for the legalization of the actual practice .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
It was stressed that the very high real interest rates in transitional economies such as Kazakstan were characteristic of a transitional period of macro adjustment and reflected high levels of uncertainty and perceived risks to lenders ; such rates did not represent equilibrium conditions and far exceeded the possibilities for most enterprises to generate sufficient real income . 
In order for the UNISPACE III Conference to yield concrete results in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , sufficient consideration should be given to the planning of realistic and feasible follow-up activities that could be implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the UNISPACE III Conference .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
However , this criterion must be linked with the preceding one , since such control must be sufficient to enable the armed group or dissident forces to conduct sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the Protocol .  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Despite the tighter labour markets and strong consumer demand in the United States and the United Kingdom , inflation rates in both countries remain subdued , and there were only sporadic signs of incipient inflationary pressures , although in late March 1997 the Federal Reserve considered that these were sufficient to justify a small increase in the federal funds rate . 
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
The Committee recommended that the ongoing revision of laws should take account of hidden , indirect and structural discrimination and that sufficient attention should be paid to the formulation of temporary special measures in the fields of politics , education , employment and the implementation of de jure and de facto equality for women .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
Yet the attainment of a proper mix of distributive and redistributive policies is important , because private initiative , although crucial , is not sufficient for the achievement of an equitable and prosperous society .  
The assembled leaders renewed their commitment to ensure that all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life .  
At a more basic level , the question was raised as to whether the categories of acts listed in chapter III of the outline possessed sufficient elements in common to be treated alike or to be subjected to the same legal regime .  
The independent expert considered that the advisory services programme had not provided sufficient support for surveys required prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or for the preparation of reports by States in need of assistance .  
The experiences of small island developing States to date suggest that institutional and administrative capacity-building is a protracted and complex process that requires sustained political commitment and sufficient resources .  
While the current personal mobile satellite communication systems were designed to provide data rates sufficient for messaging services and voice data , future systems were designed to support broadband applications .  
The transformation from emergency reconstruction to sustainable longer-term development also assumes continued political and economic stability , which provides a necessary , but not sufficient , basis for rapid growth , a key national objective .  
Consequently , the appellate court found that the affidavits of the subjective intent of both parties raised sufficient factual question as to the terms of the parties contract under article 8 ( 1 ) CISG that summary judgment was inappropriate .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
The overall objective is to provide analysts and decision makers at the national and international level with a sufficient number of relevant , timely and reliable development indicators .  
Such information may relate to the size and type of previous projects carried out by the bidders ; the level of experience of the key personnel to be engaged in the project ; sufficient organizational capability , including minimum levels of construction , operation and maintenance equipment .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
Even if the case results in the summary dismissal of a staff member , the evidence may not be sufficient to satisfy the standard of proof applicable in criminal matters considered by national courts .  
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , including through international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Notes that the United Nations Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of Human Rights does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but are facing economic hardship ;  
It should also be emphasized that another of its objectives was to forestall the financial crisis facing the existing social security institutions in the medium term , and thereby ensure that their income would be sufficient to meet their obligations to pensioners and their administrative costs .  
The Chairman-Rapporteur noted that no governmental delegation had expressed formal opposition to the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples within the United Nations system , although a number of Governments had stated that they had not yet taken a final position with regard to whether a new forum should be established , or whether it would be sufficient to broaden the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations .  
The alternative approach that was suggested ( i.e . , the inclusion of an open-ended provision describing such financial practices in sufficiently broad terms to cover existing practices and future developments ) was found to be impractical in view of the difficulty of describing a wide range of heterogeneous and rapidly changing practices with sufficient precision .

In connection with regulation 2 , some delegations were of the view that the biennial financial period should not start in 2002 , since budgetary requirements to be estimated in advance of a biennial period could only be based on stable and foreseeable expenditure patterns and the Meeting did not yet have sufficient information to foresee the developments in relation to the Tribunal 's expenditures .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
At its forty _ ninth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1997 / 107 taking note that it did not have sufficient time for a comprehensive discussion of the final report of the Special Rapporteur on income distribution and human rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 9 ) , decided to postpone to its fiftieth session the presentation by Mr .

It is recognized that there is a vital link between national stability and economic and social development , and that the provision of adequate and sufficient assistance to Haiti is largely subject to a return to political stability .  
The general principles are that : ( a ) in order to be both financially viable and of sufficient quality for simultaneous interpretation , communications for remote interpretation require the use of ISDN lines for the transmission of both audio and video ; and ( b ) under the International Standards Organization standards applicable to simultaneous interpretation equipment , the minimum sound bandwidth acceptable for interpretation purposes is 12.5 kHz .

The Committees attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that are to be financed outside of the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received , in advance , from the States Parties and States not parties participating in such activities .  
The worsening of the debt situation of middle-income and some lower-middle-income countries was due not only to the incapacity to pay debt obligations owing to temporary shortfalls in revenues but also to the more structural problem of raising sufficient revenue , particularly hard currency , in the long term to service their debts , while preserving their sustained economic growth and development .  
However , in order to protect workers from employers who might attempt to impose harsh wage conditions or who might fail to pay workers a wage sufficient to meet their basic needs , the State has felt obliged to intervene in order to improve the living standards of workers and , consequently , contractual freedom is no longer absolute in the field of employment since the State has begun to intervene in order to protect workers , particularly in regard to wages .  
Due regard must also be paid to the need for consistency in classification , nomenclature , terminology and definitions and the committee 's minimum wage proposals must be based on those to which an average skilled and competent worker is entitled , without gender-based discrimination , in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and the need to ensure that the wage is sufficient to meet the worker 's basic needs .

For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
Motivated by the need to protect the health and safety or our population and our environment , we believe that these efforts should continue , thus promoting the adoption of mechanisms that will provide sufficient guarantees to all the States concerned that the strictest safety measures will be applied in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , and that any damage resulting from accidents in connection with such operations will be made good .  
The Committee ' s attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties which , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the State parties in advance .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations .

This is especially true where products ( especially services ) are difficult to specify clearly and may vary significantly in quality ( for which sufficient adjustment is not made ) , and where annual national average prices are able to fall , quite logically , within a wide price band ( as say , in the case of India or China ) .  
With regard to the above , there have not been sufficient efforts or effective measures by the Government to replace the authoritarian components of its system of organization with the elementary principles characteristic of any pluralist and democratic society , this being most apparent at the middle levels of the State and particularly in local administrations .  
From what the Special Rapporteur was able to determine , it may be said that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has been complying with these agreements , although there has been a pronounced delay in their implementation , a matter which , as already stated , is most disturbing inasmuch as the measures agreed are of the greatest importance for achieving a climate of dtente with sufficient safeguards before the legislative elections due to be held on a date not yet fixed in 1999 .  
Since , in Chile , credit approval depends on the applicants solvency and ability to offer sufficient collateral , with real property being preferred to personal property , married women under the joint ownership regime face legal obstacles .

However , it has been observed that the existence of mechanisms that may affect a creditors ability to deal with its collateral will not generally deter a lender from extending credit as long as the lender can develop a sufficient degree of comfort that the insolvency laws will be enforced in a reasonably predictable and transparent manner , that the lender will be compensated in a fair way for the diminution in value of its collateral and that the lender will ultimately be able to realize upon its collateral within a reasonable period of time .  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
The original estimated altitude of the circular orbit has been lowered from 250 kilometres to 220 kilometres in order to ensure a sufficient reserve of fuel on board for the dependable conduct of the final operations , which along with variable atmospheric conditions has led to a change in the planned date of re-entry and impact .

As regards the particular issue under consideration , the Working Group agreed , however , that the place of conclusion of a contract , as traditionally understood in private international law , might not provide sufficient basis for a workable solution in an electronic environment and that other , more modern concepts , such as the notion of centre of gravity of a contract or other related notions , might also be considered .  
First , it is unreasonable to believe that a clean and effective police force can be established when the majority of police officers , especially in Republika Srpska , are paid an irregular wage that is not sufficient for daily life .

I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
The ruling is a positive sign , in that it was objective and made a point of stating that the investigation of the facts must continue , but at the same time it demonstrated the impunity surrounding such acts , in that the authorities responsible for the investigation were unable to gather sufficient evidence to prosecute the real culprits .  
As regards record-keeping , views were expressed that there was also a need to establish agreed minimum standards ; it was noted that national systems for record-keeping could vary according to differing national circumstances and regulatory arrangements , provided that national authorities ensured that the systems in their country were sufficient to enable individual arms to be identified and traced in a timely and reliable manner .  
She stressed the need to strengthen normative , legislative and organizational frameworks in the interests of a stable and predictable world economy , adding that one way to facilitate the developing countries integration into that economy was to provide sufficient development funding ; the International Conference on Financing for Development could play an important role in that .
