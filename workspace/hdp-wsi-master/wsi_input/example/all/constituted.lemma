As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .

In essence , the assumption of all governmental powers by SLORC in 1988 constituted , as mentioned earlier , a break from constitutionality and legal continuity and further constituted a departure from the norms governing the enjoyment of political rights proclaimed in article 21 of the Universal Declaration . There could , arguably , have been some legitimacy in the assumption of power by SLORC , without the consent of the people , in circumstances which could be said to have amounted to a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation .

It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .

The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .

The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence .

The principle that no one could possess two nationalities was no longer absolute because , due to common roots or historic ties between nations and the greater mobility of people , it was not always possible to avoid cases of double or multiple nationality without injustice to the persons concerned .
