Observers here are convinced that the fundamental cause of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo is because the UN delegation and international peacekeeping force in Kosovo have not earnestly implemented Resolution 1244 adopted by the UNSC but are carrying out a policy of " supporting Albanians and suppressing Serbs . " They have shown partiality for and connived with Albanian extremists ' " ethnic cleansing " against other nationalities .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
Any person , so long as he lives in this world , should enjoy the rights to subsistence , personal security , and all kinds of freedom .  People should treat each other equally despite their races , white , yellow , or black , and religious beliefs .  Any discrimination , hostility , killing in revenge , or ethnic cleansing is considered illegal .  
In certain busy areas , cleansing services last until mid-night .  Since the number of local residents in the New Territories has risen from 2.07 million ( 37 per cent of Hong Kong population ) to 3.11 million ( 47 per cent of Hong Kong population ) over the previous decade , the RSD opined that the standard of environmental hygiene should be improved .  
At present , intensive cleaning operations will be mounted at specific locations if necessary , where extra manpower and resources in addition to the daily cleansing fleet will be deployed to scavenge floating refuse .  
Clean Hong Kong is one of the initiatives stated in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address this year .  The objective is to bring about visible and sustainable improvements on the ground through both active cleansing operations and public education and publicity efforts .  It will last for three years and comprise four key elements : * Stepped up enforcement action against littering and dumping of waste ;  
Although extra resources have been devoted to upgrading the facilities and improving the management of public toilets , including the contracting out of cleansing services to private contractors at an annual expenditure of over $ 29 million , users ' co-operation is of paramount importance in sustaining cleanliness .  
The cleansing teams will help needy residents , such as the elderly and the disabled , to remove discarded articles and rubbish accumulated in common areas of their buildings , including roofs , staircases , canopies and rear lanes .  
Relevant departments at present only request in the contracts with the cleansing contractors / providers to provide clean and hygienic toilet paper with no specific standard set for the bacterial content .  
For the remaining toilet paper provided by the cleansing contractors , when individual relevant departments enter into new contracts with the contractors in future , they would request the contractors to provide toilet paper which complies with the hygienic standard stipulated in the tender specification of GSD .  
A department spokesman said cleaning contractors and regular staff would join forces to mount special cleansing operations at major leisure and cultural venues this weekend .  These include sports centres , parks and playgrounds , swimming pools , public libraries , museums , civic centres , stadiums and performing venues .  
Approximately after 7 a.m . on the following day of March 28 , the school succeeded in informing the HKEAA that due to the necessary disinfecting and cleansing required subsequent to one of its students contracting atypical pneumonia , it had decided not to provide its hall as the examination centre for the advanced supplementary level subject of " Chinese Language and Culture " of the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination ( HKALE ) .  
Filming these images in black and white , besides cleansing the expressive contents by filtering out the disturbance of inappropriate hues , also gives them a special quality feel , a graininess , a tonal contrast , and a layering effect all unachievable by color as well as concentrating their feelings of emptiness , repression , and intensity in a way that only black and white can .  
To use wooden fish to temper one 's mind has a very symbolic meaning . The never-sleeping eyes tell us that Buddhist cultivation is limitless and that the cleansing process is endless . The masters living in the tranquil temple purify their inner selves day and night . What about we who remain in the material world ?  
On a table , a gently flickering candle illuminates a photo of the Indian guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar , clad in a white robe . Members of the Art of Living Foundation of Taipei City , posed in various postures with their hands raised chest - or waist-high , practice the " cleansing breathing method " ( sudarshan kriya ) . It promises to enhance the vitality of their lungs , invigorate their cells , and expel accumulated toxins and negativity , bringing the melody of their lives into harmony .  
An impressive parade with over 100 vehicles wound through the streets and alleys of Wanhua while temple staff in cars sprinkled cleansing holy water to expel SARS . People held tightly to the charms and peace cookies the King of Chingshan had given out and bowed to him again and again . And they lit long strings of firecrackers in the hope of scaring away this new epidemic of the 21st century .  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
A Member of the United Nations family has fallen victim to a blatant and cruel war of conquest , accompanied by genocide , rape , religious " cleansing " and mass expulsions , the consequence of which is a horrible new kind of Serboapartheid .  
For 20 months we have been spectators helpless spectators of aggression , territorial conquest , " ethnic cleansing " , intolerance of every kind , and continuing massive , flagrant , systematic violations of human rights .  
If the existence of the numerous mass graves situated at or near identified detention facilities were to be confirmed , such confirmation would be relevant to the inquiry into " ethnic cleansing " ( see paras .  129150 ) .  
In other words , " collective responsibility " a primitive and archaic concept will gain the upper hand ; eventually whole groups will be held guilty of massacres , torture , rape , ethnic cleansing , the wanton destruction of cities and villages .  
It fully shared the concern of the international community at the human rights violations committed in that country , and condemned the practices of ethnic cleansing and the acts of violence whose origins lay in racial hatred .  
The Conference stressed that all persons who perpetrated or authorized criminal acts associated with ethnic cleansing were individually responsible and accountable for such human rights violations .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
" The rights protected by the Constitution [ of the Federation ] include all those currently recognized in international human rights law and others which have not yet attained full international recognition .  There is also specific enumeration of a package of rights which would entirely reverse the effects of the practice of \ x { e50d } thnic cleansing . . .  
They justify the drafting of new international instruments to complete the existing legal arsenal , so that those who continue to perpetrate cruel and inhuman acts , genocide and ethnic cleansing can be punished .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
We have come to realize the growing importance of effective regional tools in addressing this new type of mostly internal conflicts , where the rule of law and accountable national administrations are often non-existent , where warlords and other unscrupulous leaders lead campaigns of intimidation , ethnic cleansing and genocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred .  
The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which is suffering the consequences of Belgrade 's ambition to create a Greater Serbia inspired by the philosophy of national chauvinism , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the forceful changing of borders lies at the centre of the present-day Balkan crisis , concentrated in the former Yugoslavia . 
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .  
Although numerous resolutions of the Security Council reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia , confirming the inadmissibility of the annexation of territory by force and condemning ethnic cleansing have been adopted , the reaction of the international community to the challenge posed by the Serbs has always been hesitant and confused .  
The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis strongly condemns the outrageous and cowardly acts of genocide , ethnic cleansing and indiscriminate killing of the innocent and helpless , on all sides in this brutal conflict .  
However , the lack of political will to suppress aggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with United Nations decisions , coupled with the unreasonable , immoral and legally baseless insistence by some on extending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia to the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the Serbs that they can continue with impunity their murder , destruction , aggression , ethnic cleansing and genocide .  
However , we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable suffering , to shameful operations of so-called ethnic cleansing and to crimes against humanity , which the international community was unable to prevent and before which it remained passive .  
While the human rights situation had improved in various parts of the world , it had grown much worse in the former Yugoslavia , particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the policy of ethnic cleansing , accompanied by inhuman practices of unprecedented violence , had led to the exodus of entire populations and caused countless victims .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
She referred to the latest report of the Special Rapporteur , which confirmed the persistence of grave human rights violations , the systematic and daily slaughter of innocent people , the odious practice of ethnic cleansing and forced resettlement , even in the so-called " security " zones .  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
The frequent appearance of corpses in the so-called " graveyard " bearing signs of torture and coups de grace , the fact that the victims are frequently common criminals , and the inability of the competent national agencies to locate the perpetrators , are characteristic of the modus operandi of the organized groups involved in " social cleansing " campaigns , which can hardly operate without the tolerance , complicity or direct participation of agents of the State .  
Following the perverse logic of ethnic cleansing , ethnic Serbs were often evacuated prior to an attack against civilian targets in ethnically mixed regions so that Serb forces could conduct indiscriminate shelling and wholesale random killings , safe in the knowledge that among the victimized population there were no ethnic Serbs .  
The United Nations must never again permit itself to be reduced to a passive observer or , even worse , an obedient assistant to the Pale regime in their final act of ethnic cleansing .  
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .  
The Indonesian delegation has consistently expressed its strong condemnation of the shelling of safe areas and population centres , the sniping at civilians , the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts and the perpetration of ethnic cleansing involving , inter alia , the relocation of populations by force , summary executions and the destruction of homes , cultural institutions and places of worship by the Bosnian Serbs .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Oman , like the rest of the international community , accepts neither this new escalation of fighting by attacking United Nations peace-keepers nor the status quo prevailing in those safe areas which recently became subject to the policy of ethnic cleansing .  
Oman believes that there is an obligation a moral obligation , a political obligation on all members of the international community to work together united with one voice that would say No to ethnic cleansing , No to rape of Muslim women and No to the continued violations of the safe areas . 
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
" [ All forms of gender-based violence , including those resulting from all forms of sexual harassment , prostitution , pornography , sexual slavery and exploitation , including those violations resulting from cultural prejudice , racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia , ethnic cleansing , religious and anti-religious extremism and international trafficking in women and children , are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated . ] "  Fifth sentence .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Urge the identification and condemnation of the systematic practice of rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women as a deliberate instrument of war and ethnic cleansing and take steps to ensure that full assistance is provided to the victims of such abuse for their physical and mental rehabilitation ;  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
It should be obvious from the above that the Greek Cypriots are among the least qualified people to talk of respect for " human rights " when successive reports of the Secretary-General and international press reports attest to the fact that during the period 1963-1974 there was a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people by the Greek Cypriot side .  
The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance indicated the deep concern raised in the international community by those tendencies , among which " ethnic cleansing " gave special cause for alarm .  
After having undertaken a drastic policy of ethnic cleansing against Serbs , the Croatian authorities are already calling into question the Serbs ' right to be represented in Parliament , the Government , regional and other authorities because for that aspect of political life they do not fulfil the new condition of representing the prescribed 8 per cent in Croatia 's total population .  
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
It is expected of the international community to respond to the biggest ethnic cleansing carried out so far in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , following Croatia 's brutal aggression against the Serb Krajina and after joint Muslim-Croat attacks on traditionally Serb ethnic territories in western and north-western Bosnia , even after a cease-fire agreement was announced .  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
extremely dangerous trend was emerging with the approach of the twenty-first century ; local wars , particularly within the former Soviet Union , had led to ethnic cleansing and destruction of the economic , historical and cultural wealth of the occupied nation .  
The serious and massive occurrence of discriminatory and repressive practices aimed at ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , as a whole , resulting in widespread involuntary migration ; and noting also that the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolutions 1993 / 9 of 20 August 1993 and 1995 / 10 of 18 August 1995 , considered that those measures and practices constituted a form of ethnic cleansing ;  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
National chauvinism ; ethnic intolerance ; racial , economic and religious discrimination ; ethnic cleansing ; and acts of violence and repression against an entire population characteristic features of Serb policy were demonstrated for the first time in Kosovo .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a generation of young people which the media has of late characterized as being lost the young people of Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia who , not so many years ago , were confident children of Europe and who have now spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and ethnic cleansing , with all the revulsion inherent in that expression , a youth spent between death and barbarism .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
With regard to the situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , double standards were evident , with certain countries demanding air strikes in retaliation for ethnic cleansing committed by one side , while turning a blind eye to identical acts committed by the other sides .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Moreover , the inaction of the institutions responsible for investigating the appearance in public places of abandoned corpses , whose common characteristics conform to the modus operandi of " social cleansing " operations , supports reasonable doubts as to the existence of the clandestine structures referred to in commitment IV of the Comprehensive Agreement .  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .  
As regards the Greek Cypriot side 's self-portrayal as the victimized party in the Cyprus question , I wish to underline that there is ample graphic evidence in the form of reports by the Secretary-General and the international press that during the years between 1963 and 1974 a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing was directed by the Greek Cypriots against their former Turkish Cypriot partners in Cyprus .  
Regrettably , the world continued to be confronted by civil strife , ethnic cleansing , lawlessness and extreme poverty , all of which posed a considerable challenge to the full enjoyment of human rights .  
With regard to racial discrimination , his delegation naturally condemned racial violence , xenophobia and racism , but could not accept a failure to take account of the flagrant violations of the rights of peoples represented by colonialism , foreign occupation , genocide , ethnic cleansing , and the hatred voiced of Arabs , Africans , Asians and the peoples of Latin America , all issues which were not broached in the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance . 
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
Meanwhile , as is clear from the above , the international community of States has unequivocally admitted that the Abkhaz separatists are still pursuing " ethnic cleansing " by using the most barbaric methods in the territory under their control , leading to the massive destruction and forcible expulsion of the Georgian population , who had made up half the total population of Abkhazia before the conflict .  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
Honduras pressed ahead with the cleansing of its political system , and Panama continued the process of broadening national consensus around the goal of a successful management of the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
In many instances , warfare is triggered and sustained by the manipulation of fears and animosities that may have little bearing on real or perceived grievances ; group identity along ethnic or communal lines has become the rationale for intolerance , racism , hatred and such repugnant concepts as ethnic cleansing .  
The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
The wars in the former Yugoslavia were marked by horrendous crimes against international humanitarian law , often committed in the name of that repulsive policy , ethnic cleansing .  
It is now time for the international community to be more united and determined to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and to find a peaceful and workable solution to calm the situation and to resolve the conflict in Kosovo .  
The periodic reports of the Secretary-General and of the international press provide ample graphic evidence of a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people during that period .  
The claim that the Serbian authorities pursue an open policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing supported by brutal military and police action against innocent Albanian civilians is both untrue and ludicrous .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
Their actions may fit into the context of so-called social cleansing operations , criminal activities , illegal crime control , whether organized or not , the securing of economic or political advantages by illegal means , and personal vendettas .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
The intensified terror tactics and military assaults by the Yugoslav forces against the ethnic Albanian community in many parts of the province represent the continuation of a systematic repression by the Yugoslav authorities to drive innocent civilians , especially women and children , out of Kosovo , reminiscent of the policy of ethnic cleansing that was carried out during the dark days of the Bosnian crisis .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields .

In this context , the OIC Contact Group lends full support to the Secretary-General for his initiatives and diplomatic efforts in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons under international protection throughout Kosova . * Reissued for technical reasons .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
We wish to recall the declaration of the Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Contact Group , held in Geneva on 7 April 1999 ; to confirm our strong condemnation of the policy of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Serbian authorities against the Albanian Kosovars ; and to demand an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities and the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo .  
The OIC Contact Group lends its full support to all diplomatic efforts and initiatives in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes under international protection .  
Since the arbitrary termination of the autonomy of Kosovo by the Belgrade authorities in 1989 , we , together with the international community , have watched with great distress the Serbian acts of atrocities against the innocent and hard-working people of Kosovo and the campaigns of ethnic cleansing that have been reminiscent of the preceding sinister acts against the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina that were also committed by the Serbs .  
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .  
Albania highly appreciates the irreplaceable role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , which stopped one of the greatest human catastrophes in Europe after the Second World War and which brought to a halt the genocide and the ethnic cleansing carried out against millions of innocent Albanian civilians in the heart of Europe , thereby protecting the best values of our world civilization .  
While the issue of the protection of civilians in conflict will be the subject of a special report to the Security Council in September 1999 , the environment for timely humanitarian action in many countries continues to be compromised by deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian workers , ethnic cleansing , atrocities committed against children and denial of access to humanitarian assistance .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
Additionally , the legacy of the Kosovo crisis upon the federal authorities , when the international community , led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , intervened in order to halt ethnic cleansing , has not encouraged the scheduling of formal bilateral meetings .  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
These ignominious acts of terror , the glaring few in a multitude , provide abundant evidence that , despite the contrary pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences , the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK and KFOR continue to countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija .  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
The norms and principles of international law are interconnected and interdependent , and they constitute an integral system designed to bar humanitarian disasters and ethnic cleansing , as well as acts of aggression .  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
It was convinced that the members of the Committee would , as in previous years , support in large numbers the current years resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo , as a message that genocide and ethnic cleansing were unacceptable and as a sign of solidarity with the Albanian people .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
Mr . AL-BUSAIDY ( Oman ) said that he looked forward to the establishment of an international criminal court which would help to put an end to bloodshed and prosecute those responsible for such heinous crimes as ethnic cleansing , aggression , genocide , torture and the forcible transfer of defenceless civilians .  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
The safe , voluntary and dignified return of refugees and displaced persons is essential to reverse the consequences of ethnic cleansing and to heal , as far as possible , the deep and festering wounds that it caused during the long years of war .  
In some parts of the world , ethnic , religious and political conflicts had led to the systematic violation of human rights , blatant disregard for humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing .  
Thus , the recognition that UNMIK has been incompetent ( or unwilling ) to halt the final stages of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Metohija and to establish civil administration is revealed in all its devastating brutality .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
The episodes of ethnic cleansing committed throughout the history of humanity were intended to harm both the racial , religious and cultural identity of a group or people , at times its very physical existence .  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
Even after signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement , the Ethiopian hordes had wilfully , wantonly and methodically launched indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets , taken prisoners , tortured , raped and murdered , attacked and destroyed villages , public facilities , cultural and religious infrastructures and institutions and engaged in ethnic cleansing , causing large numbers of persons to become displaced .  
Racism was , on the one hand , fear of the unknown a fear which , in extreme situations , could lead to racial cleansing in the desire to eliminate all differences and , on the other , a lack of curiosity , patience and understanding vis - - vis other people .  Yet cultures needed diversity to flourish , while racist behaviour stemmed from social pressure , assumptions and misconceptions .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
Recruitment and use of child soldiers , the proliferation of small arms , the indiscriminate use of landmines , large-scale forced displacement and ethnic cleansing , the targeting of women and children , the denial of even the most basic human rights , and widespread impunity for atrocities are still all too familiar features of war .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .  
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .  
Observers here are convinced that the fundamental cause of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo is because the UN delegation and international peacekeeping force in Kosovo have not earnestly implemented Resolution 1244 adopted by the UNSC but are carrying out a policy of " supporting Albanians and suppressing Serbs . " They have shown partiality for and connived with Albanian extremists ' " ethnic cleansing " against other nationalities .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
Any person , so long as he lives in this world , should enjoy the rights to subsistence , personal security , and all kinds of freedom .  People should treat each other equally despite their races , white , yellow , or black , and religious beliefs .  Any discrimination , hostility , killing in revenge , or ethnic cleansing is considered illegal .  
In certain busy areas , cleansing services last until mid-night .  Since the number of local residents in the New Territories has risen from 2.07 million ( 37 per cent of Hong Kong population ) to 3.11 million ( 47 per cent of Hong Kong population ) over the previous decade , the RSD opined that the standard of environmental hygiene should be improved .  
At present , intensive cleaning operations will be mounted at specific locations if necessary , where extra manpower and resources in addition to the daily cleansing fleet will be deployed to scavenge floating refuse .  
Clean Hong Kong is one of the initiatives stated in the Chief Executive 's Policy Address this year .  The objective is to bring about visible and sustainable improvements on the ground through both active cleansing operations and public education and publicity efforts .  It will last for three years and comprise four key elements : * Stepped up enforcement action against littering and dumping of waste ;  
Although extra resources have been devoted to upgrading the facilities and improving the management of public toilets , including the contracting out of cleansing services to private contractors at an annual expenditure of over $ 29 million , users ' co-operation is of paramount importance in sustaining cleanliness .  
The cleansing teams will help needy residents , such as the elderly and the disabled , to remove discarded articles and rubbish accumulated in common areas of their buildings , including roofs , staircases , canopies and rear lanes .  
Relevant departments at present only request in the contracts with the cleansing contractors / providers to provide clean and hygienic toilet paper with no specific standard set for the bacterial content .  
For the remaining toilet paper provided by the cleansing contractors , when individual relevant departments enter into new contracts with the contractors in future , they would request the contractors to provide toilet paper which complies with the hygienic standard stipulated in the tender specification of GSD .  
A department spokesman said cleaning contractors and regular staff would join forces to mount special cleansing operations at major leisure and cultural venues this weekend .  These include sports centres , parks and playgrounds , swimming pools , public libraries , museums , civic centres , stadiums and performing venues .  
Approximately after 7 a.m . on the following day of March 28 , the school succeeded in informing the HKEAA that due to the necessary disinfecting and cleansing required subsequent to one of its students contracting atypical pneumonia , it had decided not to provide its hall as the examination centre for the advanced supplementary level subject of " Chinese Language and Culture " of the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination ( HKALE ) .  
Filming these images in black and white , besides cleansing the expressive contents by filtering out the disturbance of inappropriate hues , also gives them a special quality feel , a graininess , a tonal contrast , and a layering effect all unachievable by color as well as concentrating their feelings of emptiness , repression , and intensity in a way that only black and white can .  
To use wooden fish to temper one 's mind has a very symbolic meaning . The never-sleeping eyes tell us that Buddhist cultivation is limitless and that the cleansing process is endless . The masters living in the tranquil temple purify their inner selves day and night . What about we who remain in the material world ?  
On a table , a gently flickering candle illuminates a photo of the Indian guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar , clad in a white robe . Members of the Art of Living Foundation of Taipei City , posed in various postures with their hands raised chest - or waist-high , practice the " cleansing breathing method " ( sudarshan kriya ) . It promises to enhance the vitality of their lungs , invigorate their cells , and expel accumulated toxins and negativity , bringing the melody of their lives into harmony .  
An impressive parade with over 100 vehicles wound through the streets and alleys of Wanhua while temple staff in cars sprinkled cleansing holy water to expel SARS . People held tightly to the charms and peace cookies the King of Chingshan had given out and bowed to him again and again . And they lit long strings of firecrackers in the hope of scaring away this new epidemic of the 21st century .  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
A Member of the United Nations family has fallen victim to a blatant and cruel war of conquest , accompanied by genocide , rape , religious " cleansing " and mass expulsions , the consequence of which is a horrible new kind of Serboapartheid .  
For 20 months we have been spectators helpless spectators of aggression , territorial conquest , " ethnic cleansing " , intolerance of every kind , and continuing massive , flagrant , systematic violations of human rights .  
If the existence of the numerous mass graves situated at or near identified detention facilities were to be confirmed , such confirmation would be relevant to the inquiry into " ethnic cleansing " ( see paras .  129150 ) .  
In other words , " collective responsibility " a primitive and archaic concept will gain the upper hand ; eventually whole groups will be held guilty of massacres , torture , rape , ethnic cleansing , the wanton destruction of cities and villages .  
It fully shared the concern of the international community at the human rights violations committed in that country , and condemned the practices of ethnic cleansing and the acts of violence whose origins lay in racial hatred .  
The Conference stressed that all persons who perpetrated or authorized criminal acts associated with ethnic cleansing were individually responsible and accountable for such human rights violations .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
" The rights protected by the Constitution [ of the Federation ] include all those currently recognized in international human rights law and others which have not yet attained full international recognition .  There is also specific enumeration of a package of rights which would entirely reverse the effects of the practice of \ x { e50d } thnic cleansing . . .  
They justify the drafting of new international instruments to complete the existing legal arsenal , so that those who continue to perpetrate cruel and inhuman acts , genocide and ethnic cleansing can be punished .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
We have come to realize the growing importance of effective regional tools in addressing this new type of mostly internal conflicts , where the rule of law and accountable national administrations are often non-existent , where warlords and other unscrupulous leaders lead campaigns of intimidation , ethnic cleansing and genocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred .  
The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which is suffering the consequences of Belgrade 's ambition to create a Greater Serbia inspired by the philosophy of national chauvinism , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the forceful changing of borders lies at the centre of the present-day Balkan crisis , concentrated in the former Yugoslavia . 
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .  
Although numerous resolutions of the Security Council reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia , confirming the inadmissibility of the annexation of territory by force and condemning ethnic cleansing have been adopted , the reaction of the international community to the challenge posed by the Serbs has always been hesitant and confused .  
The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis strongly condemns the outrageous and cowardly acts of genocide , ethnic cleansing and indiscriminate killing of the innocent and helpless , on all sides in this brutal conflict .  
However , the lack of political will to suppress aggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with United Nations decisions , coupled with the unreasonable , immoral and legally baseless insistence by some on extending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia to the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the Serbs that they can continue with impunity their murder , destruction , aggression , ethnic cleansing and genocide .  
However , we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable suffering , to shameful operations of so-called ethnic cleansing and to crimes against humanity , which the international community was unable to prevent and before which it remained passive .  
While the human rights situation had improved in various parts of the world , it had grown much worse in the former Yugoslavia , particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the policy of ethnic cleansing , accompanied by inhuman practices of unprecedented violence , had led to the exodus of entire populations and caused countless victims .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
She referred to the latest report of the Special Rapporteur , which confirmed the persistence of grave human rights violations , the systematic and daily slaughter of innocent people , the odious practice of ethnic cleansing and forced resettlement , even in the so-called " security " zones .  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
The frequent appearance of corpses in the so-called " graveyard " bearing signs of torture and coups de grace , the fact that the victims are frequently common criminals , and the inability of the competent national agencies to locate the perpetrators , are characteristic of the modus operandi of the organized groups involved in " social cleansing " campaigns , which can hardly operate without the tolerance , complicity or direct participation of agents of the State .  
Following the perverse logic of ethnic cleansing , ethnic Serbs were often evacuated prior to an attack against civilian targets in ethnically mixed regions so that Serb forces could conduct indiscriminate shelling and wholesale random killings , safe in the knowledge that among the victimized population there were no ethnic Serbs .  
The United Nations must never again permit itself to be reduced to a passive observer or , even worse , an obedient assistant to the Pale regime in their final act of ethnic cleansing .  
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .  
The Indonesian delegation has consistently expressed its strong condemnation of the shelling of safe areas and population centres , the sniping at civilians , the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts and the perpetration of ethnic cleansing involving , inter alia , the relocation of populations by force , summary executions and the destruction of homes , cultural institutions and places of worship by the Bosnian Serbs .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Oman , like the rest of the international community , accepts neither this new escalation of fighting by attacking United Nations peace-keepers nor the status quo prevailing in those safe areas which recently became subject to the policy of ethnic cleansing .  
Oman believes that there is an obligation a moral obligation , a political obligation on all members of the international community to work together united with one voice that would say No to ethnic cleansing , No to rape of Muslim women and No to the continued violations of the safe areas . 
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
" [ All forms of gender-based violence , including those resulting from all forms of sexual harassment , prostitution , pornography , sexual slavery and exploitation , including those violations resulting from cultural prejudice , racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia , ethnic cleansing , religious and anti-religious extremism and international trafficking in women and children , are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated . ] "  Fifth sentence .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Urge the identification and condemnation of the systematic practice of rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women as a deliberate instrument of war and ethnic cleansing and take steps to ensure that full assistance is provided to the victims of such abuse for their physical and mental rehabilitation ;  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
It should be obvious from the above that the Greek Cypriots are among the least qualified people to talk of respect for " human rights " when successive reports of the Secretary-General and international press reports attest to the fact that during the period 1963-1974 there was a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people by the Greek Cypriot side .  
The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance indicated the deep concern raised in the international community by those tendencies , among which " ethnic cleansing " gave special cause for alarm .  
After having undertaken a drastic policy of ethnic cleansing against Serbs , the Croatian authorities are already calling into question the Serbs ' right to be represented in Parliament , the Government , regional and other authorities because for that aspect of political life they do not fulfil the new condition of representing the prescribed 8 per cent in Croatia 's total population .  
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
It is expected of the international community to respond to the biggest ethnic cleansing carried out so far in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , following Croatia 's brutal aggression against the Serb Krajina and after joint Muslim-Croat attacks on traditionally Serb ethnic territories in western and north-western Bosnia , even after a cease-fire agreement was announced .  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
extremely dangerous trend was emerging with the approach of the twenty-first century ; local wars , particularly within the former Soviet Union , had led to ethnic cleansing and destruction of the economic , historical and cultural wealth of the occupied nation .  
The serious and massive occurrence of discriminatory and repressive practices aimed at ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , as a whole , resulting in widespread involuntary migration ; and noting also that the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolutions 1993 / 9 of 20 August 1993 and 1995 / 10 of 18 August 1995 , considered that those measures and practices constituted a form of ethnic cleansing ;  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
National chauvinism ; ethnic intolerance ; racial , economic and religious discrimination ; ethnic cleansing ; and acts of violence and repression against an entire population characteristic features of Serb policy were demonstrated for the first time in Kosovo .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a generation of young people which the media has of late characterized as being lost the young people of Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia who , not so many years ago , were confident children of Europe and who have now spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and ethnic cleansing , with all the revulsion inherent in that expression , a youth spent between death and barbarism .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
With regard to the situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , double standards were evident , with certain countries demanding air strikes in retaliation for ethnic cleansing committed by one side , while turning a blind eye to identical acts committed by the other sides .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Moreover , the inaction of the institutions responsible for investigating the appearance in public places of abandoned corpses , whose common characteristics conform to the modus operandi of " social cleansing " operations , supports reasonable doubts as to the existence of the clandestine structures referred to in commitment IV of the Comprehensive Agreement .  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .  
As regards the Greek Cypriot side 's self-portrayal as the victimized party in the Cyprus question , I wish to underline that there is ample graphic evidence in the form of reports by the Secretary-General and the international press that during the years between 1963 and 1974 a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing was directed by the Greek Cypriots against their former Turkish Cypriot partners in Cyprus .  
Regrettably , the world continued to be confronted by civil strife , ethnic cleansing , lawlessness and extreme poverty , all of which posed a considerable challenge to the full enjoyment of human rights .  
With regard to racial discrimination , his delegation naturally condemned racial violence , xenophobia and racism , but could not accept a failure to take account of the flagrant violations of the rights of peoples represented by colonialism , foreign occupation , genocide , ethnic cleansing , and the hatred voiced of Arabs , Africans , Asians and the peoples of Latin America , all issues which were not broached in the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance . 
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
Meanwhile , as is clear from the above , the international community of States has unequivocally admitted that the Abkhaz separatists are still pursuing " ethnic cleansing " by using the most barbaric methods in the territory under their control , leading to the massive destruction and forcible expulsion of the Georgian population , who had made up half the total population of Abkhazia before the conflict .  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
Honduras pressed ahead with the cleansing of its political system , and Panama continued the process of broadening national consensus around the goal of a successful management of the transfer of the Canal to exclusive Panamanian control after 31 December 1999 .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
In many instances , warfare is triggered and sustained by the manipulation of fears and animosities that may have little bearing on real or perceived grievances ; group identity along ethnic or communal lines has become the rationale for intolerance , racism , hatred and such repugnant concepts as ethnic cleansing .  
The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
The wars in the former Yugoslavia were marked by horrendous crimes against international humanitarian law , often committed in the name of that repulsive policy , ethnic cleansing .  
It is now time for the international community to be more united and determined to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and to find a peaceful and workable solution to calm the situation and to resolve the conflict in Kosovo .  
The periodic reports of the Secretary-General and of the international press provide ample graphic evidence of a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people during that period .  
The claim that the Serbian authorities pursue an open policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing supported by brutal military and police action against innocent Albanian civilians is both untrue and ludicrous .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
Their actions may fit into the context of so-called social cleansing operations , criminal activities , illegal crime control , whether organized or not , the securing of economic or political advantages by illegal means , and personal vendettas .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
The intensified terror tactics and military assaults by the Yugoslav forces against the ethnic Albanian community in many parts of the province represent the continuation of a systematic repression by the Yugoslav authorities to drive innocent civilians , especially women and children , out of Kosovo , reminiscent of the policy of ethnic cleansing that was carried out during the dark days of the Bosnian crisis .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields . 
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
In this context , the OIC Contact Group lends full support to the Secretary-General for his initiatives and diplomatic efforts in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons under international protection throughout Kosova . * Reissued for technical reasons .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
We wish to recall the declaration of the Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Contact Group , held in Geneva on 7 April 1999 ; to confirm our strong condemnation of the policy of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Serbian authorities against the Albanian Kosovars ; and to demand an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities and the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo .  
The OIC Contact Group lends its full support to all diplomatic efforts and initiatives in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes under international protection .  
Since the arbitrary termination of the autonomy of Kosovo by the Belgrade authorities in 1989 , we , together with the international community , have watched with great distress the Serbian acts of atrocities against the innocent and hard-working people of Kosovo and the campaigns of ethnic cleansing that have been reminiscent of the preceding sinister acts against the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina that were also committed by the Serbs .  
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .  
Albania highly appreciates the irreplaceable role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , which stopped one of the greatest human catastrophes in Europe after the Second World War and which brought to a halt the genocide and the ethnic cleansing carried out against millions of innocent Albanian civilians in the heart of Europe , thereby protecting the best values of our world civilization .  
While the issue of the protection of civilians in conflict will be the subject of a special report to the Security Council in September 1999 , the environment for timely humanitarian action in many countries continues to be compromised by deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian workers , ethnic cleansing , atrocities committed against children and denial of access to humanitarian assistance .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
Additionally , the legacy of the Kosovo crisis upon the federal authorities , when the international community , led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , intervened in order to halt ethnic cleansing , has not encouraged the scheduling of formal bilateral meetings .  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
These ignominious acts of terror , the glaring few in a multitude , provide abundant evidence that , despite the contrary pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences , the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK and KFOR continue to countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija .  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
The norms and principles of international law are interconnected and interdependent , and they constitute an integral system designed to bar humanitarian disasters and ethnic cleansing , as well as acts of aggression .  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
It was convinced that the members of the Committee would , as in previous years , support in large numbers the current years resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo , as a message that genocide and ethnic cleansing were unacceptable and as a sign of solidarity with the Albanian people .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
Mr . AL-BUSAIDY ( Oman ) said that he looked forward to the establishment of an international criminal court which would help to put an end to bloodshed and prosecute those responsible for such heinous crimes as ethnic cleansing , aggression , genocide , torture and the forcible transfer of defenceless civilians .  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
The safe , voluntary and dignified return of refugees and displaced persons is essential to reverse the consequences of ethnic cleansing and to heal , as far as possible , the deep and festering wounds that it caused during the long years of war .  
In some parts of the world , ethnic , religious and political conflicts had led to the systematic violation of human rights , blatant disregard for humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing .  
Thus , the recognition that UNMIK has been incompetent ( or unwilling ) to halt the final stages of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Metohija and to establish civil administration is revealed in all its devastating brutality .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
The episodes of ethnic cleansing committed throughout the history of humanity were intended to harm both the racial , religious and cultural identity of a group or people , at times its very physical existence .  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
Even after signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement , the Ethiopian hordes had wilfully , wantonly and methodically launched indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets , taken prisoners , tortured , raped and murdered , attacked and destroyed villages , public facilities , cultural and religious infrastructures and institutions and engaged in ethnic cleansing , causing large numbers of persons to become displaced .  
Racism was , on the one hand , fear of the unknown a fear which , in extreme situations , could lead to racial cleansing in the desire to eliminate all differences and , on the other , a lack of curiosity , patience and understanding vis - - vis other people .  Yet cultures needed diversity to flourish , while racist behaviour stemmed from social pressure , assumptions and misconceptions .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
Recruitment and use of child soldiers , the proliferation of small arms , the indiscriminate use of landmines , large-scale forced displacement and ethnic cleansing , the targeting of women and children , the denial of even the most basic human rights , and widespread impunity for atrocities are still all too familiar features of war .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .  
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .
